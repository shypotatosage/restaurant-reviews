"A great spot to grab dinner! The place was packed on a Friday night and even though we had 9pm reservations, it still took us a bit to get seated. I could understand why once we had gotten our meals because the food is so delicious. We ordered the Arancini for our app, and the Gnocchi and Bucatini as our entrees and the Affogato and Gelati for desert and everything was beautifully presented and delicious. The arancini was heavier than we expected and ended up not quite being able to finish our pasta, but so glad we saved space for desert because the hazelnut gelato was the highlight. They also have an extensive wine list and nice options even if you just want a glass. The ambiance is so inviting and at one point the staff even started singing and dancing to the Italian music. It was such a fun night and the food will definitely have us coming back!",Good,Good,Good

"I am (was) not even a big fan of italian food, but this restaurant redefines the standards. For reference, I have been this week in Michelin starred restaurants across NYC. This is genuinely much better. Quality of ingredient is the highest I've tried in USA. Cooking is impressively top level. Wine list is the best I have seen in NYC: lots of regions, years and styles for sparkling, white and red. I had lunch and will come back for dinner. Simply the best I have tried in NYC, from all food styles. Congratulations. I will come here every time I will be in NYC.",Good,,
"I booked but I arrived earlier and they could anticipate my accommodation. Traditional Sicilian food. Nice place and well decorated. Small, so t recommend booking.

"I took my husband here for dinner for his birthday while in NYC after seeing it was rated so highly on Trip Advisor - what a disappointment.


The food was average at best - very salty and rather sad. And the noise! We gave up trying to talk to each other in the end and had to communicate with our waitress by writing things down! Tables are super close together and the lack of walkway between them meant we were constantly bumped and jostled. 


Staff were smile but harassed as they weee obviously told to turn tables as fast as possible. We weren‚Äôt even asked if we‚Äôd like a second glass of wine - probably because we‚Äôd have lingered too long.


The food itself was mediocre at best - pasta was ok but super salty and the seafood we both chose was tired and ‚Äúwoolly‚Äù.. We didn‚Äôt have time for a dessert as they wanted us off the table - or that‚Äôs how it felt.


Despite mentioning my husband‚Äôs birthday on the booking, no effort was made to celebrate it. And less an hour and a half after arriving we were back on the street, ¬£220 poorer and with ringing ears.  All in all a very disappointing experience - I can‚Äôt believe this is the best Manhattan has to offer.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"My daughter and I made a lunch reservation here while visiting NYC. We were not disappointed! We made a reservation for an outdoor table and fortunately they were able to accommodate. Outdoor seating is limited, with perhaps four tables seating two persons each. The tables are well shaded with umbrellas for warmer days. The indoor seating was plentiful! 


Our waitress was amazing, and brought samples of wine prior to ordering‚Ä¶.she also suggested wines based on our orders. Service was prompt, and our entrees came out quickly.


The menu is expansive with something to please every palate. They also offer lunch specials daily. There are pastas, meat dishes, as well as seafood dishes. We were very satisfied with our choices of pasta with red sauce and the other in white sauce! We did not order dessert, but the cannoli, crepe br√ªl√©e, and tiramisu looked fabulous! 


We did not feel rushed, and were allowed to linger over our wine until we asked for our check! 


Definitely make a stop here down if in the SoHo vicinity!",Good,Good,Good
Very charmig place in the mid of Soho. The  service was excellent and kind and the pasta delicious. We got a table outside which was perfect that sunny evening.,Good,Good,Good
"As Italians who know Good, Piccola Cucina exceeded our expectations. The fritto misto was perfectly crispy, the lasagne were rich and comforting, and the paccheri with squid were a highlight with its fresh, tender squid and al dente pasta.
Desserts were a delight: the tiramisu was light and flavorful, and the complimentary cannoli had a perfect crunchy shell and creamy filling. Piccola Cucina offers authentic Sicilian flavors with exceptional quality and passion. A must-visit for true Italian cuisine lovers!",Good,,

Welcoming and quick service, well-kept venue and exquisite dishes. The menu offers a wide choice of appetizers and first courses from Italian cuisine. I absolutely recommend the meatballs, the grilled calamari and the parmigiana. A true delight for the palate! Slightly high prices (especially for wines), but in line with the quality that this restaurant offers in a trendy neighborhood of New York. Final rating: 10/10! Good guys!",Good,Good,Good

The staff is always kind and accommodating.
Special thanks to the chef for letting us return to Italy a few days early.",Good,,Good
My husband and I had a lovely meal at that restaurant. He had the tagliatelle with black truffles and I had the fish of the day. Both were excellent! It is a quaint little place with a great atmosphere. Service was excellent. Danilo was our waiter and he was very attentive. The wine list is great but pricy. I am on a gluten free and Keto diet and I was able to enjoy a great meal there.,Good,Good,Good

"My wife and I were ""unfortunately"" only on the last day of our trip to New York and I must say that it was a CRAZY experience! Flavors that I have never tried even in Italy! We had an amazing pasta alla standard, and desserts...a fantastic Tiramisu and some Sicilian cannoli that not even in Sicily are so good. It's just a shame to have met him in the end, because he had to go there every day. Only flaw? The chef is ""Messinese""....and I, being ""Reggino"", must admit that this time Sicily wins üòâ. Congratulations and always carry on your authentic Italian cuisine. When we return to New York next time we will get a subscription üòÖ",Good,Good,

"Authentic Italian food with American portions. Great selections of food and wine. We were extremely satisfied with our server Danilo, he was polite, professional and passionate.  Would definitely come here again and recommend to friends!",Good,Good,Good
"We went here because of it's high Tripadvisor rating, big mistake. I understand that when you eat Italian food in the States it is always 'Americanised' but we thought that due to it's no.1 rank on Tripadvisor it would be different here and would actually be authentic Sicilian.


The place was so noisy with loud music that you would NEVER find in Sicily and everyone dining has to shout, why?? I really do not want to know how the guy on the next table thinks he does a great job and the best worker in his company, bla, bla, bla.


The food was beyond disappointing, nothing was fresh, all processed, the seafood was not fresh, the meat was not fresh and the pasta sauces were highly processed, they left a dreadful aftertaste for a full day. 


Perhaps it was once a great place but we ended up visiting yet another restaurant chain bastardising Italian food by Amercian-ising it, if you have ever been to Sicily, or anywhere else in Italy do not expect to receive the same authentic Italian food here.


In Italy, the waiting staff are professional and treat you as a valued customer, here you seem to be an inconvenience with waiting staff racing to get you to the tipping part of the evening, that's if you can get even their attention without constantly being told, 'just a minute' several times. I think I have now visited my last Italian restaurant in the States, this experience has finished us off. It seems to be the trendy place to be seen because of it's ranking rather than the place to visit for good authentic food, not sure why people see it has being a place to be seen though, surely to impress your guests you would go to a place with Good, I wonder how many people ever only go here once and never return?


I also do not appreciate having the larger tip option being circled on our bill, how rude and arrogant this is, for the service and food we received here I would prefer to give no service tip at all as the service was dire but being in the States service tips are obligatory and not a payment to reward Good as it is everywhere else in the world.


Point to note: when you visit here you are visiting a chain restaurant and not an authentic Sicilian osteria. Why is it so difficult to find good Italian food in the States?",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We are on a culinary trip with my hubby and Piccola Cucina Estiatorio was our first pick. The pasta and cannolis stood out as favorites. Service was great, so we'll be surely coming back for more!",Good,Good,Good

After easily reserving a table online we showed up with yes our hopes being very high. For the first time the food was everything I had hoped for. 
1. Arancini: nicely crunchy and flavored. Not oily or old at all. 
2. Grilled veggies: although simply presented they were really tasty and fresh.
3. Involtini: out of this world. Exactly made like in my town in Sicily. A Moist, tender, flavored with some really tasty  mozzarella cheese, served on a nice bed of caponata.
4. Maccheroni alla Norma: finally my very favorite dish. I almost cried. Besides a fantastic pasta, rigorously cooked al dente, there was a more than generous amount of diced eggplant, obviously, with basil leaves, olive oil and everything the Mediterranean has so generously given to Sicily for thousands of years. It‚Äôs worth mentioning the more than welcome grated ‚Äúricotta salata‚Äù as a testimony to the high attention to detail of Chef Gioele. That was a dinner I will not easily forget. 
The last thing I want to say is that, according to the highly professional and attentive staff, almost every single ingredient in this restaurant is flown directly from Sicily including the very tasty cannoli filled with ricotta cheese. (The cheese flies frozen during shipping).
Sorry for the long review. I only wanted to show my super happiness with this restaurant. ANGELO.",Good,Good,Good

"The service was terrible. As there was a table with 5-6 partying people, all staff was focused on this table. Other tables were forgotten. Extras to the main dish came after the main dish was finished. No respect to the customer, no apologises from the staff after the extras were rejected. Just a bill!.. If You want to eat and feel general service - skip this place.",,Bad,Bad
"Highly recommended! Small and welcoming place. We had three first courses and they all turned out to be excellent. Considering the prices of the city, this restaurant can also be considered quite cheap.
Friendly and helpful staff, special mention for Cinzia who made us feel like we were in Italy for an evening.",Good,Good,Good
Sorry.I've been here at least once each year for 5 yrs. This is the worst service ever. Food was ok but the nice staff service was gone. What happened.,Good,,Bad

Italians, stay away from here!! There are millions of places (including Italian ones) where you can eat well and spend a nice evening in NY. This is not one of those.",,Bad,Bad
"Very nice Italian food, Good and reasonable prices, this restaurant is definitely a go. We took one of the two tables on the sidewalk just after sunset on a very hot summer day, and had a memorable experience.",Good,Good,Good
I‚Äôm not sure who‚Äôs giving this place good ratings since their food was undercooked and very underwhelming service both times I have gone. The waiter never even came to refill water. Went with two different groups both times and had the same experience.,Bad,Bad,Bad

Went with some friends for dinner. The waitress was very nice and attentive to us the entire night.

This place is literally amazing.",Good,Good,
"BEST RESTAURANT IN THE CITY IF NOT THE WORLD. Bar none. Fresh, homemade pasta. Recipes straight from Sicily. Authentic, cozy, unpretentious vibe. I recommend this place to everyone I know and am here at least once a month. It would not be New York without Piccola Cucina!",Good,Good,
"If there is one Italian restaurant to visit when you land in NYC it is Piccola Cucina estiatorio. The food, the staff, the ambiance- everything is absolute perfection. When I go I feel like I am at an authentic Italian restaurant- which is true! The staff are mostly all from Sicily and a lot of their ingredients are imported and made in house. The quality is unmatched and the staff are truly the best type of people. The chef is also extremely talented and famous. Highly reccomend. Get the fennel salad, the lentil salad, bronzino, eggplant parm, penne Arrabiata, and pesto pasta. Also definitely make room for dessert. Their canolies are the best in the city no joke. 


I also had my birthday here and it was the best birthday celebration I‚Äôve ever had. The restaurant played the best music and everyone got up to dance. Saturday nights at piccola cucina are where it‚Äôs at.",Good,Good,Good
Amazing spot. Food is great. They have an amazing pasta selection and so far i‚Äôve tried them all. The pasta alla norma is my favorite and the people who work there are super friendly.,Good,Good,Good
"We were positively surprised by the food and service here. As an appetizer, we ordered octopus, which was one of the best I've ever had. The fish of the day was also very good. and to finish, a lemon cheese cake dessert that was excellent. The place is a little tight, , but the excellent service makes up for it.",Good,Bad,Good
We had a delicious meal at this tiny restaurant in SoHo! Cinzia was our server and she was absolutely lovely. The pasta is fresh and al dente and do not pass on the gigantic pile of prociutto with fresh burrata. Heavenly!  Beautiful wine list too. Definitely recommend.,Good,,Good
The food was AMAZING. I‚Äôve lived here for five years and just found this spot- wish I found it sooner. All the servers were so kind. And the pasta was unbelievable. Lovely apps as well.  Can‚Äôt wait to come back.,Good,Good,Good

The food is really delicious especially the lobster pasta. And our waitress Cinthya was really nice. Will come back next time!,Good,,Good
"We went on a Tuesday night and had a reservation - which was a good thing, it was packed! Prices were typical for NY but the portions were substantial so that was good. My friend and I were both interested in the ossobuco ravioli. We both ordered it and had no regrets. It was an exceptional dish and both plates were cleared. definitely recommend piccola for a hearty and very very tasty italian meal.",Good,,
"great spot for authentic Italian food. Arancini to die for.
Incredibly creamy Cacio e Pepe. Succulent ossobuco ravioli. 


Cinzia was so sweet,  pleasant and outgoing.

"Truly authentic Italian located in the heart of Manhattan. 
Fantastic food, excellent wine & accommodating staff.
A true must visit when in NYC.",Good,Good,Good
"This is a small, boisterous, Italian restaurant. I would definitely make a reservation.  The food was very good but unfortunately, due to the size of the restaurant, and the line up outside of people waiting to get in, you feel like you are being rushed.  
The busboy continually walked by eyeing our table trying to take away any plate, glass, utensil that he thought we had finished with.  This is definitely not a place you go to have a nice, relaxing dinner.  Your are in and you are out.  
We had a reservation for 6:30 and we had to wait outside for about 15 minutes to get a table.  When we left I said , ""thank you, have a good evening"" to the hostess.  She was so busy that she did not even respond.  Everyone was running around, very busy.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Excellent place! The food is delicious and the attention is super good, I highly recommend it if you want to have a good time and eat tasty!",Good,Good,Good
"Outstanding food in a charming cosy setting. We had a quick lunch and it was excellent. Bruschetta, calamari and croquettes. All were terrific. We would readily come back whenever in NYC


The place was packed and I imagine it typically is. Best to call and reserve.",Good,Good,

"We arrived on a busy 8th of March evening for my wife‚Äôs birthday dinner, though we were a bit early the staff organized a table and their overall attitude to their job was impressive. The location is small and noisy but it creates the atmosphere of NYC, we expected the place to be like that. 
The food was perfection. fritto misto was huge and fresh. penne al pomodoro and bucatini cacio e pepe were delicious. ",Good,,Good
We went here because the restaurant was ranked number one in New York but considering the ranking we were very disappointed. The food wasn‚Äôt bad but it wasn‚Äôt good either. Flavors weren‚Äôt balanced properly. We also felt rushed by the staff. This is certainly not the best restaurant in New York.,Bad,,Bad
"The pasta options were all delicious.  We tried the Wild Boar, Eggplant and a Seafood pasta and all were very good.  The Chicken Milanese with fingerling potatoes was also very good capped off with one tiramisu.  All in all a good family Italian night and reasonably priced for NYC.",Good,,
"Not the best Italian in NYC as some reviewers say, but it was very good. The appetizer was top notch, the entrees were good, and the cannoli was definitely A+.  Wines were good and reasonably priced.  I'd like to try it again and go with some of the more traditional dishes.",Good,,
I had no clue! Read all the wonderful reviews and ended up in a crowded restaurant-everyone jammed in! Had to wait outside in the cold for 25 minutes for our reserved table. The music is so loud you feel like you are in a nightclub! No ambiance at all. You can‚Äôt even talk to the waiter the music is so loud. Food was ok but nothing special. I‚Äôve eaten in many wonderful Italian restaurants all over the world! I would never recommend or go back.,,Bad,
"But for is the experience wasnt as good as we hoped. We Made a reservation-but where put outside - had food very quick and 20 minutes later we left.. afterwards we even got an e-mail saying that we didn‚Äôt go so i answered we did.. 


We liked the good but we would have loved to be inside..",,Bad,Bad
I've been to Piccola Cucina Estiatorio four times and found it truly wonderful every time. The food is astoundingly good and the service is efficient. The staff is a highlight - so helpful and they have quite a bit to cope with as this is a BUSY restaurant with a lot of people wanting a table. Book a table in advance and make sure you're booking the correct restaurant. They have a couple of nearby restaurants.,Good,,Good
"I‚Äôve been here a few times already with different friends and family, and it‚Äôs always been an excellent experience! The food is just delicious! Great service and atmosphere. As an Italian who lives in NY, I highly recommend this restaurant as one of the best and authentic Italian restaurants in the city.",Good,Good,Good
This place is so amazing! The quality and service are top notch. My favorite Italian restaurant in all of NYC. The servers are so kind and the chef comes around to check often - he is very kind and passionate!,Good,Good,Good
"‚Ä¶ Yes please! Service was impeccable, food was delicious. Yes reservations are required. My only one tiny complaint is that it was so hot inside for me, I should have worn a tank top üòÇ Even though tables are super close to you, it doesn‚Äôt feel intrusive. It is very loud so your conversation can still somewhat be private. The artichoke appetizer was divine as well as whatever my sister got but I can‚Äôt remember ! It‚Äôs in my pic ;) Would definitely return and recommend.",Good,,Good
"The service, staff, and food are incredible and the atmosphere is lovely. Have been going for years a",Good,Good,Good
"I was ecstatic to enter this well regarded eatery. Visits are undoubtedly worthwhile for the food. We ate lasagna, cacio e pepe, and a Greek salad. Both delicious and filling. The only issue would be the loud music, which felt more like it belonged in a nightclub than a restaurant. The server was also excellent and I will go back.",Good,Bad,Good
"One of my favorite restaurants in nyc. Food is delicious and staff is just the best. Highly recommended for any occasion!

"La Piccola Cucina is hands down my favorite restaurant. Every single dish is out of this world, especially the pasta dishes. My personal favorites are the lasagne and the   pasta ala norma. I've never had a pasta before with such a perfect texture, and this is what sets this restaurant apart from all the others‚Äìin-house made pasta and done with expertise you can taste.


I had the pleasure of meeting the head chef, Gioele La Rosa after the dish and even got to speak with him for a bit. This man is so passionate about what he does and you taste it in every single bite. I do not need to go to any other Italian restaurant as long as this one is around.",Good,,Good
"I've been coming here since it opened before I was going to their locations in Soho. The food
and service is outstanding, the pastas are out of this world .
They have a nice outdoor seating area , and try their tiramisu .
Never been disappointed .",Good,Good,Good
"We often visit the place to celebrate family and friends occasions. Last time we were there in October 2022 to greet a friend from abroad in NYC. The quality of food is always excellent, fresh, and delicious. That time we were nicely surprised with new staffed artichoke appetizer, highly recommend it. Also we had razor clams and calamarata pasta with branzino and almond. My regular favorite dish is fussily, it has amazing fish sauce I cannot resist. Go and try it!",Good,,

"This is by far my favorite restaurant in all of New York City. They make the most amazing food with fresh, high quality ingredients and the plating is always so gorgeous. Their pastas are the best that I've had and are always cooked perfectly al dente. All of their seafood dishes are delicious- especially the crudo. I have yet to have fresher seafood at an Italian restaurant. The desserts are incredible as well. The staff is super friendly and the ambiance of the restaurant is so cute and fun. You really feel like you're in Italy. Chef Gioele always created the most amazing specials and makes sure the dining experience is top notch. I bring all of my friends and family here whenever people visit and everyone has loved it every time. You MUST try Piccola Cucina Estiatorio!

The first time I went to Piccola Cucina Estiatorio it was during the pandemic and I felt in love with this spot since then. 
Not only I was very impressed by the nice atmosphere but especially by the great food. 
Italians are very picky when it comes to food, we know, and I have to say that Piccola Cucina made me felt like I‚Äôd never left Italy. 


I go pretty often to Piccola Cucina Estiatorio and every time I‚Äôm always very torn because I‚Äôd eat all the menu!
They have the best raw fish you could find.
Carpaccio and tartare are absolutely my fav dishes. Therefore, their pasta is a master, each pasta you have on the menu is delicious and mouthwatering ! 


The last but not the least, get their tiramisu! They prepare it right in front of view and it‚Äôs terrific.


It‚Äôs always a pleasure to go to Piccola Cucina also because the chef and the staff are always very nice and they can recommend you very well. They are a great team I just wanna thanks them for doing such a great job and for making expats feel home! 


Trust me, this place is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è",Good,Good,Good

"Best restaurant in NYC.  we‚Äôve been coming here for years and it‚Äôs spectacular every time!  We love the chefs, hosts and everyone in between!",,Good,Good
Showed up for our 730pm reservation on time. Patiently waited outside in a chilly wind tunnel for 25 minutes with no follow-up.  Entered to get an update and encountered zero empathy. Was seated about 5 minutes later. The crowd has deteriorated from cheerful locals to obnoxious tourists. We decided to leave. It‚Äôs too bad the food and service used to be great we‚Äôve visited this location many times over the past decade or more. Very disappointing experience.,,Bad,Bad

"My daughter took us here on our last night in NYC. What a treat! We didn‚Äôt have a reservation but they could accommodate us. The restaurant is cute and quaint. The service was great. The food was delicious. We got the grilled calamari and I thinks it‚Äôs the best Calamari I‚Äôve ever had. We ordered two pastas and a salmon tartar. Everything was delicious. The rigatoni with pesto and lobster melted in your mouth. But what was especially nice was one of our party could not eat dairy and the staff went out of their way to ensure that his dish was dairy free. 
And last but not least, their wine list was awesome. 
Highly recommend. Will definitely go back when we‚Äôre in town.",Good,Good,Good
We stumbled upon this restaurant walking in Soho and this was the best Italian meal I have had in Manhattan. My seafood pasta was wonderful. The desserts homemade and just a fantastic meal. The restaurants directly surrounding this one were begging us to come in. I was worried that they were not busy. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table here. Now I know why.,Good,,
"Excellent service! Excellent wine, excellent pasta!!


It was so Delicious!! 


We will come back for sure! 


An incontournable!",Good,,Good
"Dissappointed, my meal wasn't hot and I had to send it back. My husband's meal was bland and dry, nothing like the previous time The rest of the family weren't impressed either....just no care went into preparation and/or they are just reheating cooked food. Sad they have gone downhill, won't be going back. Too many other great places to try.",Bad,,
"I am really picky when it comes to Italian food. This place is really good, cozy, friendly staff, and very Good. We had Maccheroni alla Norma and Bucatini cacio e pepe con tartufo nero. Can't wait to visit again.",Good,Good,Good
Piccola Cucina my top choice for Italian in NYC.  I am a local and it is absolutely my go-to. The pasta is the best you can get (imo) and tastes like it was literally made in Italy.  Every time. The staff is all absolutely lovely too as well as the ambience. Highly recommend!!!!!,Good,Good,Good

Expect to discover the essence of Sicilia in the heart of New York. Would definitely visit again when I come back to the city.",Good,Good,Good
"Was very excited to get into this highly rated restaurant. The food is definitely worth the visit. We had a Greek salad, cacio e pepe and lasagna. So filling and delicious. Only complaint would be the music was very loud and gave a nightclub vibe not a restaurant. Server was also fantastic and will return.",Good,Bad,Good
Went here when visiting NYC with my mum. We had a fantastic meal! We shared bruschetta to start then each had lasagna. It was the most fantastic meal. The service was also absolutely delightful. I couldn't recommend this place enough but make sure you book!!,Good,Good,Good
A perfectly NY tiny and tight Italian - fish forward restaurant. A little outdoor space gave a few extra tables. Almost impossible to get a reservation but keep trying it is worth it. Extensive pasta selection. A tad hard to find low cal - low carb options but it‚Äôs ok to splurge,Good,,
"This is one of the best meals I‚Äôve ever eaten in my life! And we‚Äôve eaten all over the world. 
I had the lasagna which was different than any lasagna I have ever had before, but it was so divine I almost cried when it was all gone. 
My husband had the Bucatini Cacio e pepe. They cook the bucatini (thicker than spaghetti)  and then put the cooked pasta in a massive block of cacio cheese until the pasta melts cheese onto the noodles. Then they scoop out the pasta and melted cheese and put fresh cracked pepper on it. 
The entire restaurant stopped and watched while it was happening because it was absolutely fascinating.
I absolutely will eat here every time we come back to New York! It is a small quaint place with a chef straight from Sicily Italy.",Good,Good,
"Trip Advisor recommendation. Fabulous authentic Italian, great vibrant atmosphere, very popular. Small so I would recommend booking in advance. Great service, friendly staff. Food was excellent.",Good,Good,Good
"Wow! I would give this six stars if I could. Nice quaint Italian restaurant in the SOHO district. The bruschetta was the best I‚Äôve had since dining in Italy 11 years ago. I had the Bucatini pasta with the cacio cheese and pepper. They brought out a giant block of cheese to the table then proceeded to melt the cheese with the pasta, then added the black pepper. It was delicious! My wife had the lasagna and it was hands down the best lasagna I‚Äôve ever tasted. Not sure how anyone could give this restaurant anything but five stars- it was amazing!!!",Good,,
"Small scale and fairly intimate. Great food, great interior, great service and a great atmosphere. Busy, so reserve if you can or go early like we did. We would readily return.",Good,Good,Good

"Yesterday ive been here with friends and I‚Äôve never experienced anything like that in NY‚Ä¶ food is exceptional we tried couple of different appetiser and a few different pastas.

Pictured are fusilli with langoustine scampi with Burrata and rigatoni with pesto and octopus for main course and salmon tartare cannoli as appetizer special. Absolutely all pastas on the menu are delicious, just pick one and you won‚Äôt be disappointed!!!",Good,Good,Good

"Visited NY from Los Angeles earlier this month. On Oct 14, local friends took us here. We had a great time and loved everything about it. Then on our last night in NY, we had LA friends visiting so we took them. A special night. Misha the ma√Ætre d, recognized us from the prior week and was engaging, gracious, and looked after us very well. Food-spectacular; wine-had never had Sicilian wine and he directed us to a couple of bottles which we loved; service-impeccable! And, Marco did a good job, too!
Highly recommended!!",Good,Good,Good
"We came here for our first night's dinner on a recent trip to NYC. While the food was good, the pasta was well cooked, and the service was adequate - there were just too many people crammed into this small restaurant. We sat a two-top right next to the large open window to the front patio, after sidling in between tightly crammed tables and encouraging the table next to us to remove their purses from our seats and hold them on their laps. The small space was made a bit more uncomfortable by having very large format menus.  If the physical size of the menu is greater than the distance between tables - it makes things extra challenging.  In addition, the poor staff had to try to get in and around the restaurant with essentially no extra space at the serving stations, making things rough to avoid a bit of jostling.


I'd prefer to come back on a quiet night (if there is such a thing) to avoid feeling so close to everyone.",Good,Bad,Good
"We came on a Tuesday night and there was a line up so make sure to make reservations! No cocktails available at this restaurant but we did order some beers to start. We were able to bring our own wine for a corkage fee. We shared the rice balls, wild boar meatballs and lobster/guac and burrata/mush bruschetta-all excellent! For our mains we ordered the lasagna(which my husband raved about), mussel/linguine special and the grilled branzino, which were wonderful! I asked the server if they could debone the fish for me, which he replied they could not. When the fish arrived, it had been deboned! So happy! My daughter‚Äôs Milanese chicken was really tasty but it was huge and could have easily fed two people. The desserts were yummy too. Because the restaurants is small and so busy, it felt a little rushed at times(and a tad on the hot side)but we understand the need to turn tables over. The service was very attentive despite the restaurant being packed. I highly recommend!",Good,,Good
"So ... the restaurant on Spring Street didn't bother to notify me they were closed. We ended up being routed to this sister restaurant. The menu item we wanted (pasta with sea urchin) was offered but in a different version. Good, but not what we wanted. No bread is served. Shocking! They have a lunch special menu that was not mentioned and I just happened to order it. Small serving, but tasty. Crowded with table spacing way too close. We've just started going back out again but the pandemic still points to spacing further apart. All in all -- too expensive and small portions. And not serving bread is disappointing. The freebie cannoli were delicious. But overall -- I won't return.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Even my Sicilian-American parents would have been impressed with the food and wine.  Our family gathering was served delicious appetizers of rice balls, crispy calamari and eggplant Parmesan among others. The homemade lamb, osso bucco raviolis were to die for.  Dessert was an amazing cannoli consisting of a fresh, crunchy shell and sweet, creamy filling.  The wait staff couldn't have been more accommodating and courteous despite how busy it was.  Can't say enough about the experience.  If I could give more than five stars, I would!",Good,Good,Good
"This place can not even get salad correct. All the food was terrible. The place is loud, waiting staffs also have loud voices to the point of nearly defeaning you. Expensive!",Bad,Bad,Bad
Seafood pasta with shrimps and cheese was incredible. The antipasti of eggplant was tasty. Desserts were delicious. Ambience is nice and staff are very attentive and welcoming! Definitely a must visit if you are in town.,Good,Good,Good
The food is delicious. I love Italian food and this was beyond my expectations. The calamari and octopus both very fresh and generous and the pasta to die for. Generous food and lovely setting. The outdoor space is very nice. I understand why it is so high in TripAdvisor ratings,Good,Good,
"Delicious food and wonderful atmosphere! We sat outside and it was very nice. Everything we ate was delicious - burrata, arancini, octopus salad, seafood pasta, branzino (cooked perfectly!) and a side of vegetables (tasted just like Italy). Benedetta made an amazing Aperol Spritz and then when I ordered another, showed me how to make it (Grazie, Benedetta!). The cannoli are also excellent. The waiters are Italian and are very nice. As someone who lived in Italy extensively, I am picky about Italian food. Look forward to coming back for many more meals.",Good,Good,Good
"Thank you for the amazing dinner ! 
Everything taste GREAT and Italian . I have eaten the best of my life ! And the arancini was soooo YAMMY ! 
I‚Äôll be back as soon as possible for your fresh fish market! 
Thank you guys!",Good,Good,
"Visited New York for business and a co-worker was pleading that we eat Italian...and I found this establishment via some exceptional reviews. This is a quaint restaurant, rather small, but large in character. Having toured Italy, I would characterize Piccola Cucina as extremely authentic. Our server was from Sicily, the server waiting the table next to us from Rome. The wine list was 100% Italian, the most extensive, comprehensive list of offerings that I have ever seen outside of Rome, Tuscany or the Amalfi Coast. Dinner was amazing. We both feasted on the Burrata con pomodorini e basilico and Ravioli stuffed with ricotta in a mixed mushroom sauce featuring sausage meatballs. The restaurant offers a solid selection of seafood options! I will note that the restaurant was packed and people never stopped trying to get in. Looks like reservations are a must for this charming, delicious eatery...that will for an hour or so make you feel as though you are on the Italian coast. Highly, highly recommend!",Good,Good,
One of our favorite places in New York. Always delicious. Always busy. Always friendly. this night was great as usual. The Gamberi Caprese - very interesting. Bucatini Cachio Pepe - sublime. Spaghetti Neri Lobster - a feast for the palate and the eyes. The Verdure Grigliate and Patae Limone rounded out the fare. looking forward to out next adventure at Piccola Cucina.,Good,Good,Good
"We reserved at the last minute via 'open table' and when we arrived we were seated fairly quickly. The service was good for this very small and crowded restaurant, and very noisy. As for the food, it seems that Sicilian cooking can be tailored for American tastes : in other words taking the tastes out of most of the tasty ingredients starting with the complimentary sun-dried tomato and caper pur√©e. The sea food pasta plates were over salted and bathed in sauce as if to compensate the lack of taste from the starters and making tasting the pasta impossible. In general the place lacks subtlety.",Bad,Bad,Good
"Everything is good. The food, the ambiance, the service and the location. The burrata and the octopus are specially good.",Good,Good,Good
"Food amazing, staff superb and atmosphere the best.
Restaurant small but creates a unique experience.",Good,Good,Good
You‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre in Italy! Treat yourself to dinner here the food is delicious! Reasonable prices too!,Good,Good,
"We visited this little Italian gem on Christmas Eve. Great food and service. We had ravioli, truffles pasta and pasta with lobster. All great dishes accompanied with very nice Italian wine made our evening perfect. Also, the atmosphere and interior is great. If you like an Italian experience in NYC this is the place to go!",Good,Good,Good
Tiny but wonderful Italian restaurant with homemade pasta and great energy.   The staff was so kind and enjoyable,Good,Good,Good
"Piccola Cucina Estiatorio is perhaps New York‚Äôs most dedicated to the culinary spirit of Sicilian cuisine, now that Eolo in Chelsea has been closed down. I loved the Paccheri alla Carbonara, and the coffee with cannoli was a great cap on the night.",Good,Good,
We tumbled across the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon during our NY holiday and absolutely fell in love with the place. We were lucky to get a table without booking as the restaurant got quite busy shortly after. The food was very fresh and absolutely delicious and all the waiters extremely attentive. At least half of the guests were from Italy which is always a good sign to find authentic Italian cuisine. We came back on our last evening because we enjoyed it so much - highly recommend!,Good,Good,Good
"The Hostess was so nice to find us a table, even though we didn't have a reservation (and from what we saw, the place was very busy). The attention was great, and the food was DE-LI-CIOUS. We're both from Per√∫, which is THE destination to eat delicious food at fair prices, and we both agreed that Piccola Cucina could EASILY compete with any of the top restaurants back home, the prices were more than fair, and the food was amazing; will recommend to any friends/family coming to NYC.",Good,Good,Good
So many young Italian speakers in this restaurant.  All friends and all having so much fun.  Food and vibe were incredible and authentic.,Good,Good,
"Scrumptious pasta dishes with a focus on seafood and super friendly service make this place a great choice for dinner in the Village. Our sever was attentive and friendly. The environment was small and intimate and, though tables are close, the lively atmosphere made for a friendly room with a great vibe. We had a really good time and would easily recommend it both for the food and the experience. They have a full compliment of beer and wine, but no liquor license for cocktails, which I mention only because a good nigroni would fit the great food. Go and enjoy, this place hit the spot!!!",Good,Good,Good
"Nice small cozy place. Tucked away in soho. 
Busy vibe loud ambience and great food.
The staff is overly friendly & welcoming a bonus in my book.",Good,Good,Good
"Had pasta cacio pepe and a slice of pasticcio
Just fantastic. And the final coffee woth sicilian cannoli was a dream come true",Good,,
"It was a busy Sunday night, but I was able to get a table in the corner. This restaurant is one of 3 within a few blocks of each other. All Piccola Cucina, each with a different ending. I ordered cavetelli with meat sauce and wild fennel. Interestingly, it was served in the pan in which it was cooked. Large portion; adding grated cheese made it even tastier. I could barely finish it. At $18, it was reasonably priced A Peroni beer was the appropriate drink. With the front opened, it's like outside seating.",Good,Good,
"You know it‚Äôs a good start when everyone in the restaurant is from Sicily,  from waiters to cooks! The food is fresh and clearly lovingly prepared, and you just feel good eating it and after you‚Äôve eaten it. It‚Äôs a place you want to hang out out and come back to. Top-notch!   So hi to Carmello!",Good,Good,
"We visited on a very rainy night in NYC, but totally worth it!!  Started with the Grilled Sardines and Octopus which were perfectly done.  Main courses were Pasta Norma (a Sicilian traditional dish) and Pasta Fruti di Mar.  The pasta was perfectly cooked and sauce beautiful.  We have been to Sicily twice and this restaurant's food reminded us of those trips.  The place is a little noisy, but creates the warm atmosphere for this great Italian Food.  We will be back!!",Good,Good,
"After reading the reviews I had high expectations. The wine recommendations were excellent but the waiter was a bit pushy recommending too much food! We had a seafood/veggie combo appetizer and the Sicilian rice balls. Be prepared for fish and shrimp complete with heads and eyes. My sister did not like her grilled seafood plate, it looked a little too fresh from the sea. The pastas were good but a bit too al dente. Super loud once it fills up, can't really have a conversation. Next time I'll try somewhere else. Cute little place and Spring Street is a fun area for strolling.",Bad,Good,Bad
Amazing food and great wines. A lovely Sicilian corner. A special thanks to Emanuele that helped us with our choice and a perfect wine pairing.,Good,Good,Good
"My partner recently had a big birthday and we celebrated it by visiting New York, with friends flying in from Paris, France; California and Dallas, Texas to celebrate it with us - so it was really important I got the restaurant for the birthday dinner right. I chose the Piccola Cucina Estiatorio because of the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. The restaurant fully lived up to them. The food was delicious, the service was amazing and the atmosphere was fantastic. I can't recommend this place highly enough if you want a place with great food, great service and a great atmosphere. It was perfect for my partner who likes Good and service but can't stand the pretension of overly-posh restaurants. We were a party of nine and were looked after brilliantly, from the helpful person who took my call to book the table (thank you Maria) to the wonderful staff in the restaurant who made us feel so welcome. Thank you all for making it a fantastic evening which we will remember fondly for a long time.",Good,Good,Good
"I thought I‚Äôd had the best pasta in Italy but Piccolo Cucina managed to beat all expectations!


We had 3 pastas: the tagliatelle with octopus ragu, the meat ragu, and Bucatini cacio e pepe. 


The tagliatelle with octopus ragu was a complete showstopper! The other two dishes were also delicious.


The service was perfect, and the ambiance was good - relaxed and casual but it still felt special.


I can‚Äôt wait for my next trip to New York just so I can come back here!",Good,Good,Good
"Following friend suggestion we had dinner in this amazing place. After several days of junk food all around US we completely recharged our batteries with delicious Italian plates. The place is small but very nice and the waiters very kind. Pasta was delicious, very well cooked and the meet and sword fish were top quality. Strongly suggested to whom looking for very good Italian food and trendy place.",Good,Good,Good
"Good selections in the menu
Nice atmosphere 
Super kitchen and delicious 
Warm and quick service 
Tables are very close 
Guests age 25-45, relatively young atmosphere",Good,Good,Good
"The best Pasta alla Norma I have ever had in my life! I'm from Sicily, living in NY now, I'm very picky with food... and I'm in love with Piccola Cucina Estiatorio. Emanuele and all the team are great, very professional and always with a warm smile that makes you feel at home. Sicilian wine list with some gems (drink local, always) the food is amazing, fresh, tasty, perfectly cooked and also the Tiramis√π and Cannoli alla ricotta as a dessert are perfect to complete your ""Italian escape"" in NYC. Can't wait to go back!
ps: Team, the phrase on the wall ""cucinare √® un atto d'amore"" is not from Carlo Cracco but its from ""Enzo Bianchi"" from the beautiful book ""il pane di ieri"". Ciao!",Good,Good,Good
"We ate here on a Thursday night at opening (5:30).  Nice and quiet for the first  half hour until the restaurant got more crowded. Host did a great job spacing customers apart as much as possible until it got busier.
Service was fantastic and very attentive without hovering.
Each course was served promptly but did not feel rushed.
Burrata cheese with cherry tomato and arugula appetizer was the freshest cheese I've had a restaurant - seasoned perfectly with lovely presentation.
I had the squid ink spaghetti with scampi langoustine and squash blossoms - the pasta was fresh and cooked perfectly with a velvety smooth and rich sauce. Definitely one of the best pasta dishes I've had!
Dessert was very good - cannoli had perfectly crisp and flavorful shells with a delectable filling. The custard in the tiramisu and creme brulee was smooth, rich, and flavorful.
I would highly recommend this restaurant - try to come early because it is cramped and when it fills up, you have no elbow room.
Cost is a bit pricey, but not bad for quality of food and service and location!!",Good,Good,Good
"This is rated in the top 50 NYC restaurants. It‚Äôs good but is it in the top 50? The place is tiny so tables are very close together. This leaves little room for the staff to get by, which can be unnerving as hot pans are coming right at you. The noise level might exceed safe levels so don‚Äôt plan on a romantic conversation. The food is good but you won‚Äôt be blown away. The lobster and pasta was okay but the half lobster tail was dry and just sitting on top of the pasta. The service is fine and fun topped by asking our waitress for the dessert menu to which she responded, ‚ÄúThe dessert menu is me!‚Äù",Good,Bad,Good
"Visited this restaurant for our last night in NYC (it was a Monday) having read the reviews and expecting the very best Italian food.


Can‚Äôt help feeling a bit disappointed with our experience to be perfectly honest because it really didn‚Äôt live up to the reviews and I think maybe we were really unlucky. 


We had made a reservation and when we turned up at the restaurant there was a couple just in front of us who had arrived without a reservation. Without asking us first, the guy on the door showed them straight to a table and when he then came back to welcome us, we then had to wait for about 10 minutes while he found a table (clearly he hadn‚Äôt checked the reservations before seating the other couple and/or had given our table away). 


No apology, pretty inattentive service - having experienced amazing customer service in NYC, this guy definitely wasn‚Äôt someone I‚Äôd have put in charge of arrivals! 


When we were seated, there was barely any room at the tiny tables. The restaurant was very busy so consequently it was incredibly noisy and while I know this contributes to atmosphere, it was impossible to have a quiet conversation (not least because the other tables were so so close!).


Food was good, but honestly I wasn‚Äôt blown away - I‚Äôve definitely had better Italian food elsewhere in NYC and in Glasgow and London. 


We had the duetto bruschetta to start with burrata, porcini and truffle and guacamole and lobster. It was nice, although the truffle was overpowering and I personally am not particularly convinced by the pairing of guacamole and lobster. 


Then we had the Bucantini cacio e pepe with truffle and a special ravioli dish with seafood sauce and mussels.


Cacio e Pepe is my all time favourite Italian dish. I‚Äôm afraid I wasn‚Äôt blown away by this one. The pasta was a little more than al dente and the truffle sauce overpowered the simple cacio e pepe sauce too much. 


The ravioli was filled with spinach and ricotta accompanying a very rich seafood sauce, it was nice but again a little heavy. 


We had a very nice bottle of Primitivo, that was probably the highlight.


Generally the service wasn‚Äôt great - probably because it was so busy, but still. Twice in the hour we were there birthdays were announced with music so loud it could burst your ear drums - a tradition I don‚Äôt mind so much because it‚Äôs nice to make a fuss of someone on their bday but the music went on for so long, long after people had lost interest! 


I don‚Äôt like writing negative reviews because it is so difficult running and maintaining restaurants profitably and so all the positives should be celebrated. But this place is so highly rated I just wanted to provide some balance for travellers particularly because this wasn‚Äôt the outstanding quiet dinner I was expecting.",,Bad,Bad
"This small, cozy, authentic Italian restaurant specialized in seafood is our favorite place to eat in NYC. It exceeded our expectations. They have a wonderful Italian wine selection and a wide food menu with seasonal ingredients. We had a Plateau Royal and a bottle of Dom Perignon 2009 Vintage Brut. The food was beautifully presented and well-cooked. Friendly and prompt service.",Good,Good,Good
"We were so excited for our reservation and to see our big group of old friends. We were not disappointed. We sat at a long table and ordered endless food and drink. It was a small place that seemed very authentic. The bathroom was a small cozy room. The food was delicious. Everything. The waiter was super great. As the night went on and on, he pulled some of us who were dancers up to dance when a good song started! It was a hugely fun night.",Good,Good,Good
"Very nice Italian (Sicilian) restaurant.
Atmosphere is very nice and relaxing with music that goes up time to time.
Service is very good and friendly.
Excellent food, just portions a bit too big.
Reasonable prices.",Good,Good,Good
"We dined at Piccola Cucina Estiatorio this evening. It was like walking into someone‚Äôs home. It was warm & welcoming.
The staff were very attentive. The food was amazing. 
I Would highly recommend this restaurant. Five stars!",Good,Good,Good
"Best service in town. Shoutout to my men, Carmelo, Jacomo, Costa and Emanuelle! Piccola Fridays would not be the same without you!! Thank you for always accomodating me and my guests.",,,Good
"I was asked to out to dine at this restaurant with 6 Italian's (4 of them from New York) so I thought that it was always going to be a fabulous meal and a good evening and it totally lived up to those expectations.  This restaurant, like the name suggests, is a small kitchen, (with the 4 chef's busy within, which you can see clearly from the dining area).  Whilst small they cram in a lot of guests, which ordinarily if in any other restaurant you would probably think (""This is too cramped"") BUT at this restaurant it totally works and just adds to the amazing Italian party atmosphere that this place has, it really was fabulous and fun.  The food was some of the best Italian I have ever eaten... The meatballs with mushroom and truffle to start was just divine and the ricotta ravioli with mushroom and pieces of sausage was also a dish that I didn't want to end.  Prices are not too bad either with a feast of a dinner with a bottle of wine costing US$420 for 7 people.  I finished sharing a traditional Sicilian dessert called a 'Cassata' with my friend (who is of Sicilian origins) and it was absolutely delicious... The perfect end to a perfect Italian evening in downtown Manhattan.  I highly recommend this gem of a restaurant.",Good,Good,
"Love, love, loved this restaurant! Small, cosy, authentic and full of atmosphere! Had a real buzz about it! The food was delicious, very generous portions, service was great, but the ambience really makes this place! I would definitely recommend it!",Good,Good,Good
"If you crave good Italian pasta, this is the place to go. Most of the dishes are focused on seafood. The Lobster and truffle pastas are my favorite. 
The cannolis are delicious. 
The seats are very tight but you are getting really amazing food for the price. Very friendly waiters and festive atmosphere.",Good,Good,Good
"Great atmosphere, 100% authentic and passion through all staff. I would highly recommend this place to everyone!",Good,Good,Good
It‚Äôs small and crowded but that‚Äôs what makes it even more special. The wait staff works like a seamless team taking care of all patrons nonstop. It is like sitting at a family table in Italy and everyone is happy you are there! Food was delicious,Good,Good,Good
Best Italian food in nyc I love this place and the food is really really good we will come back soon,Good,Good,
"This was a return visit and the anticipation was well-deserved. Every dish was a gastronomic experience to cherish. The Duetto Sandwich is hard to share but worth every morsel. Ravioli Funghi Salsiccia to die for. Cacio Pepe is a traditional Appulian dish done perfectly. Pachheri Seafood excellent. Patate Limoni and Verdure Grigliate great accompaniments. It is very noisy, but mostly from people talking and having a good time. Spontaneous dancing broke during our meal - just like dining in a local resto in southern Italy.",Good,Good,
"One of the best Italian seafood restaurant in the area , the food is a really fantastic here , the taste of pasta is unbeatable and the fish is very fresh , so looking for a nice place to spend some good time and have an excellent sea food , this is your place",Good,Good,
If you love seafood and and pasta this is the perfect place. They have 3 locations in manhattan and they are absolutely amazing.,Good,Good,
"nothing better for a birthday celebration then having a great meal...just delicious..........snapper cerviche.....grilled octopus......arancini (rice balls with meat inside). boccatini pasta with bolognese sauce and cannolis......where do i begin..??? cerviche light and fresh.....grilled octopus ..one of the best i have ever tasted  and an ample  serving ...arancini.. you could tell by looking at them how light  they were  and so flavorful....boccatini pasta cooked to perfection al dente style with a true bolognese sauce..and the best cannolis  EVER.... 


 a shout out to Andrea and his two associates who created culinary magic in their kitchen...bravo Andrea!!!!..... the place was packed and one can understand why...the food is so good.....service was also good..but  the noise level might not be to everyone's liking.....so go with a group..or .if you like high energy or if as in my case you are celebrating a birthday which was recognized in the restaurant in grand style  ...would definitely return.",Good,,Good
Once again we tried the Cucina the night before and were excited to try this place because of the seafood dishes. The waiter was friendly and once again from Sicily. Refreshing to go to an ITalian restaurant with actual Italians working there. The wine recommendation was spot on for the meals we were having that night. The bread to start was amazing. The special that was lobster and bucatini I believe was great. The cavatelli dish I had with fennel was great.,Good,,Good
"More space more music and more choices great decor, the team is always smiling and happy, waiters sometimes lose overview of the customers but the food is always fresh fresh fresh GF pasta is available and the Ape chilling display makes you smile.
Pick any dish and you will enjoy it, authentic Sicilian flavor, priced well and good wine selection, Congratulations you found your SoHo restaurant experience",Good,Good,Good
"My NY cousins introduced my wife and I to this gem located in the Soho district. Just a small place open to the street, with a tiny kitchen. They specialize in Sicilian cuisine. All the cooks, servers etc.. were from Sicily. We shared a few appetizers; the best grilled calamari I‚Äôve ever had, arancini, buffalo mozzarella. We all ordered pasta , each dish freshly made to perfection. We also shared a few desserts, cannolis, cassata, pane cotta.. The atmosphere was awesome. Traditional Italian music playing, the waiters dancing with some of the guests. Everyone there just had an amazing time. We will definitely return on our next trip.",Good,Good,Good
"This restaurant it will never finish to surprise me: simple, authentic, excellent!!! The seafood is super fresh, the atmosphere is great, staff friendly, genuine southern italian ( Sicily) food. Each time I come back here it s simply unique experience!!! 
Great job Phi & Friends 
Mari",Good,Good,Good
Omg! I have been searching high and low for Italian food in New York on par with the Italian food I had when I visited Naples last year. Let‚Äôs just say that the search is over! I have found the place :) I had looked up restaurants through trip advisor and was impressed by this restaurants amazing reviews so I decided to check it out with my girls. The food is just out of this world amazing! Everything from the pasta to seafood is super fresh and super tasty. For the table we ordered the stuffed squid and rice balls which were super amazing and left me and my girls wanting more! For my main dish I had the cavatelli pasta. Words can‚Äôt even describe! One of my girls also had the cavatelli which she absolutely loved as well. Other entrees ordered were the branzino and the spaghetti with lobster. Everything was perfection and me and my girls were satisfied. The atmosphere was also perfect. Clientele was fun and youthful. Decor was super cute too! Service was also amazing! Our waiter Emanuele was so sweet and knowledgeable! He made us feel right at home and even took my girlfriend out to dance! We all had an amazing time and had so much fun! I will most certainly coming back!,Good,Good,Good
"This was such a find!  Easy, fun, relaxed and good Sicilian food.  The wine list is suitable to the price range and very good.  The staff are friendly, the atmosphere a hoot and the food is really good.  You will enjoy this.  Make sure you book, it get every busy and it gets noisy.  It's a fun and vibrant spot to eat.",Good,Good,Good
"In my opinion, this authentic Sicilian-Italian place, along with its two sister establishments in Soho, offer the best Italian cuisine in NYC. The ingredients are fresh, expertly prepared, and absolutely delicious.  The service is extremely friendly and efficient.  Furthermore, the prices are very competitive given the supreme quality of the food served.",Good,Good,Good
"We first went to their restaurant on Spring Street, which is very small & extremely noisy, so noisy we left and went around the corner to their, mainly, fish restaurant. I had the spagetti Nero with Langoustines and zucchini flowers. The sauce was lacking in flavour and was very peppery. They must have run out of zucchini flowers (already at 1:30pm) because there were none. My wife had the wild boar meatballs with porcini mushrooms and truffles. Both meals were okay, but not top notch Italian/Sicilian. They have very few Sicilian wines, and a lot of Tuscan / Piedmontese, which is probably understandable in the US. Sicily does have a lot of great wine producers so perhaps they aren't available here. They did have one Planeta rose, which is good, but for a popular choice Plumbago would be good. Work needs to be done in the kitchen & on the wine list, then perhaps they will live up to the name they created.",Bad,,
Never in US I found the same quality. Real real real Italian food. Cooked from real Italians. Family owned. Special friendship. I cannot find the correct words to say how I appreciate this restaurant and the guys that work there. SUPER!!!!!!!,Good,,Good
"This is a small restaurant in a little group of similar and nearby small restaurants. When one was too crowded for our party of 7, they sent us around the corner where they could accommodate us. The service was friendly and they got us fed and out fairly quickly for a table-service place so we could make it to a show. We had salads, pastas and tartare dishes, and everyone enjoyed the meal. It's easy to find top notch Italian food in the city, and this was one among equals. Not necessarily a standout, but very good, Recommend.",Good,,Good
Just amazing. We had such a.good time. Dinner was very delicious. We will come back. The octopus stater was great! The pasta Norma and the pasta bucatini was great too! The ceasar salad amazing and the lamb chops so delicious.  The cassata for dessert was amazing!!!! Love this place!  Service very good too!!!! Will come back soon,Good,Good,Good
"The service at this small restaurant was excellent.  Reservations are highly recommended, as the restaurant is small and, even on a mid-week evening, the place was full by 6:45pm.  The atmosphere of the place is generally plain, on the dark side, but nice in its own way.  My dinner consisted of three grilled prawns, which were fine but generally in the category of nothing special, and they came with lemon potatoes, which were quite odd to taste.  My partner's meal consisted of mushroom ravioli, which he said was tasty, hearty, and earthy.  


Potential diners here should note one thing:  The chef seems to have a special affinity for all things squid, and nearly one-half of the menu items and/or specials included squid or squid ink in one form or another.  ""Your average place"" with ""your average menu"" this is NOT.  If you like basic food, finding good menu options will be challenging here; if you like eclectic dining, Piccola Cucina Estiatorio may work out well for you.",Good,,Good
"This small restaurant, which has charming d√©cor, plays  the music at a deafening noise level. You cannot hold a conversation in this restaurant.  It is by far the loudest restaurant that we have encountered in NYC.",,Bad,
"The small venue on Thompson street was nice and cozy. I went on a date. It was loud, but they‚Äôre Italian so what do you expect. The menu was southern Italian. I‚Äôd order the grilled octopus and langostine squid ink pasta again.  This is one of the few places that serves actual Italian food.",Good,,
"Much like its sister restaurant around the corner, this place is also an authentic Sicilian restaurant. A bit bigger than its sister but still crowded with a happy atmosphere. A loud music played in the background and everybody are happy. The food is fresh and tasteful and prices are very reasonable. Service was excellent. As pescatarians, we had many food choices. A vegetarian can also find starters and mains he or she can have.
Great place, highly recommended.",Good,Good,Good
The food was very good but not perfecto!  Started out with the swordfish roll appetizer which unfortunately disappointed. The raisins and pignoli nuts were missing from the filling and it tasted dry.  The grilled shrimp were fresh and delicious.  Bread was outstanding but had to ask for it repeatedly before it was brought to us.  Pasta dish was amazing and lamb chops very good.  Servers need to try harder. This place can be exceptional.  Like the casual vibe but music is too loud at times.,,Bad,
"This is part of an expanding chain (or at least a collection) of restaurants and despite that it's not half bad. Fresh seafood is the hallmark of this branch and it's fresh and well done (grilled sardines are a good test). There are actual Sicilians in the kitchen as well as front of house, and their senses of humor are in evidence singing along with Italian pop numbers at times (don't panic, it's not singing waiter stuff, just rowdy youngsters). One of the closer approximations to a genuine Italian eatery you'll find in this part of the world.",Good,Good,
Nice atmosphere and great service. I am Italian and I finally found the best pasta in New York City! Salmon and porcini was amazing! See you soon Piccola Cucina!,Good,Good,Good
We went here because it was across the street from our hotel.The Sixty Hotel. This place just blew us away it was so good the next day we went to their sister place around the courner... The food was the best Italian we have had in NYC..I think this is young crew and they are making an effort...love it..,Good,,Good
"Great service and cheap price for the food quality. I had the bruschette with guac & lobster and burrata, porcini, truffle as appetizer, then the Bucatini cacio & pepe.
Big portion and super delicious!",Good,,Good
"I recently had dinner at the new piccola cucina with some friends and everything was absolutely outstanding! As we shared a rich chef selection for appetizer, we tried the grilled octopus, swordfish rolls, grilled red prawns, a nice mix of raw fish and a fritto misto. It was just perfect! 


The mix of grilled fish stakes and spaghetti with shrimp and scampi we shared for main was tasty and cooked properly. 


Service was great and friendly, we all had a good time!",Good,Good,Good
"FINE DINING?! McDonald‚Äôs then should be considered FINE DINING.

I sent an email requesting to have a manager reach out to me due to our experience the night we went - no answer. We had an horrendous experience for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday dinner.  and we spoke with the ‚Äúmanager on duty‚Äù Carlos who was also the Bartender. We shared our grievances about tonight‚Äôs service and was given absolutely no respect nor response except for ‚Äúokay, pay the bill.‚Äù We were not ever going to not pay the bill, but expected acknowledgement/responsibility for what happened. But all Carlos could say was, ‚Äúokay.‚Äù He was 1) obviously not the manager; or 2) untrained manager, because he did not act like one at all. I have also never seen a manager behind the bar dressed in all black and no suit jacket in a fine dining restaurant. 


On top of it, Carlos said he was unable to come to our table because he was ‚Äúvery busy‚Äù, if he had to come to the table to hear our grievances, which would have taken just a few minutes out of his time, it could have been resolved. I told asked him if he cared about his customers, he said yes, I asked why he couldn‚Äôt stop by our table to speak to us, he said he was busy with the bar. Doesn‚Äôt seem to value customer service especially when there is a grievance. 


Our main grievance was that we asked for a table by the window. I understand it was first come first serve. We asked blanca, our waitress, and she said none were available. However, we saw two parties be sat at empty tables next to the window 10-15 minutes later. The table behind us threatened to leave if they did not get to move to the other table. I respect the service industry as I was once in that industry when I was younger. I did not think we would need to THREATEN to leave to get our request fulfilled or Good. 


We got our food. DISGUSTING. ABSOLUTELY not fine dining but more of mediocre banquet food that you have to eat because you did not eat all day. We only saw our waitress twice, once to order a $140 bottle of wine, second to take our food order and never again. The food was brought out on a black utility cart. Our waitress finally walked by and we had to wave her down, we asked for boxes shortly after receiving our food while watching more tables being sat by the window. 


Once we requested to speak with a manager, the service went downhill even more. We had to box our own food and was given absolutely no acknowledgment from our server, Blanca, for our experience. She just said, ‚Äúsorry‚Äù and ran off to get boxes and the manager. It seemed like no one wanted to provide customer service nor deal with the situation at hand except to bounce it from one person to another. 


From my knowledge, Cite is know to be a high end, fine dining  restaurant (their prices definitely show it) that prides themselves in their food, experience and service. None of that was met tonight. A $630+ bill does not equate to the service we received tonight. I realize now why they add a 20% gratuity because no one would tip 20% for the service provided. In short, the service and handling of our grievance was horrendous. 


They do not care about their customers and just want to get you in the door with their ‚Äúfine dining‚Äù and ‚Äúview.‚Äù Decor is tacky. Food is disgusting. Service is incompetent. 


ABSOLUTELY AVOID, there are so many better options in the city and you would still be able to keep at least $200+ in your pocket.",Bad,Bad,Bad
The staffing was good but the food was horrible and extremely over priced for the quality and super small portions. I paid over 350.00 for a meal for two to celebrate my wives birthday which I think was not worth 50.00 for. Also I wanted a view over the city and they gave us a view overlooking a dark lake that had no view at all. Also the restaurant was only 25 percent full for a Friday night.,Bad,Bad,Good
"We went here for our 50th Wedding Anniversary! We had reserved a table to see the fireworks and ordered the rose package - which we never got! We were put in a hallway and had to get up and walk to the other side of the restaurant and stand in a narrow space to see the fireworks! Jorge our waiter was told it was our 50th Anniversary but did not care and was attentive to All his other tables! Since we were unwilling to pay $200 - $900 for a bottle of wine and just ordered single drinks we were not worth his time! Our shrimp appetizer, fillet steaks and creme Brulle were poor quality. We were automatically charged a 20% tip for service we did not receive! Our bill was over $300 for an unacceptable celebration! We will Not be back!! We spent the same amount of money at the Capital Grille the evening before and had an outstanding meal and service!",Bad,Bad,Bad
We had an early reservation time (5:00 Tuesday evening) because of other activities planned for later that night. We were the only customers there at that time and we got the best table in the restaurant. The view was amazing and the White staff was very attentive. We ordered drinks and an appetizer and they came out very quickly. Later we ordered our entree and it arrived fairly quickly as well. The food was very tasty and was cooked to perfection. It was actually pretty nice to have the restaurant to ourselves. We enjoyed a leisurely meal and great views of the city and Lake. The meal was quite expensive but remember you are paying for the whole experience.,Good,Good,Good
"They claim to be an ""elite"" restaurant, but they are corrupt and provide horrible service. If you make a reservation, they will not honor it. Do not attempt to go here because they will not let you in, even if you have a reservation booked two weeks in advance. 


They need to be punished. I made a reservation two weeks in advance. They even took a non-refundable deposit for me to secure the reservation. I made elaborate plans specifically for this place including my guest searching for and buying a new dress for the occasion. I also paid extra for the additional services for the ""romance experience"". 


Less than 24 hours before my reservation, they called me and told me it's ""closed to the public"" and I'm not allowed to go. I asked ""why are you telling me this now? I made the reservation two weeks ago. Where am I supposed to find another reservation on a Friday night with less than 24 hours notice? That's why I planned this two weeks in advance and orchestrated everything to revolve around this reservation."" 


The person kept repeating that there is nothing she can do. I asked to speak to a manager and the person said no other workers will be there for two days, which is an obvious lie. The person said she would make a note about a refund. I asked to refund it now and she refused. 


This is not an ""elite"" restaurant like they claim. They are corrupt and do not honor their basic commitments. They will not change because they will not suffer consequences for violating their agreements. They are hypocrites. They keep your money if you cancel on them, but they do not have any penalties for canceling on you and ruining the one night you plan two weeks in advance.",,Bad,Bad
"The waiter Dimitri must have taken an instant dislike to our party as he shoved the chair smack into the back of all the men's calves as he  'helped' them to push their chairs under! A mistake??? Well if the rest of the evening was anything to go by I think not!


He tutted when we didn't choose the $250 wine! He ignored the fact I said I didn't want another drink and kept pouring them! He was not pleasant when we didn't choose the most expensive dish on the menu. (The lobster tail was $80 and my friend couldn't get any fish out whatsoever).


As my husband went to the toilet he literally barged into him with no apology and as we left he barged into our friend causing him to stumble.
We honoured the American service charge but didn't add any extra to the bill ...well that was the last straw! Dimitri aggressively came over and sarcastically (to the extreme, you had to be there to witness it) said thanks for nothing!!
Reading back it sounds pretty trivial but the whole evening was aggressive, uncomfortable, intimidating, hostile, antagonistic...... A VERY expensive mistake.
Still can't fathom his behaviour, we were middle aged, smart, relatively well off, polite customers????",,Bad,Bad
"November 30th of 2021 it was our 3 year anniversary of marriage with my husband, he booked this restaurant in a month in advance and paid for the romantic package. We got hit in the highway in the way to our reservation so we called to let them know we will be there a little late and they DID NOT picked up the phone 4 times at the 5th time they picked up the phone and told us they had kitchen problems and they let us know we NEVER GOT ANY EMAIL. My husband got a confirmation the day before. We have called servers times to get our money back and NOTHING we sent an email and NOTHING. This place sucks and literally played an important part on ruining our wedding anniversary !!! They just responded to my post today after this happened November 30th. This place sucks big time !! SAVE YOUR MONEY",,Bad,Bad
"Booked a dinner for 2 and each person carries a $20 reservation fee (?? stupid ??). Anyways, a few hours before the res, we are notified from opentable that our reservation has been cancelled. The restauarant later on calls us themselves to tell us. Its then closed for the next few days (thinking it was covid related.) however i had already paid $40. The woman on the phone said it would be refunded to my card. I trusted them and checked today, almost two months later and they NEVER REFUNDED ME. Calling tomorrow. Ridiculous. Keeping $40 after cancelling on me. I shouldnt be the one having to track this down.",,Bad,Bad
We had Thanksgiving dinner at Cite.  The food is not memorable but it is worth the price of dinner to see the spectacular view. The staff was very friendly.,,Good,Good
"Bad, Bad,just a warning: do not go there!
Upon arrival no cloak room available so the winter clothes were piled on a chair. Canapes on bread that was so dry that it seemed three days old. Salad, Lobster bisque all blunt, steaks not soft and the overall menue composition had the sophistication of bad canteen food. The set price for the menue was $400 plus and tax and 20% service (which I negatiated down as it was just too much to accept.)
Service, well he asked for the wine list (they sell at a 400% marl-up to retail prices) but we could not get a bottle as nobody came ever back to take the order. The whole experience was very disapointing. At New Year‚Äòs prices are up, ok but even taking this into consideration it was an extraordinary ripp-off . Best to avoid this place.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I brought friends and family to Cite for a birthday dinner. I should not have. 


Weeks before my birthday, I paid the reservation fees. No problem. I then called the restaurant to be sure I'd booked the right package and could get the table I wanted. Back and forth a few times, extra tips and requests, I was assured that the table would be provided. 


When I arrived for the evening, sure enough, the table I'd reserved was on the reservation - I saw it. But for some reason, the hostess seated us at another table. I asked why and she said the table I reserved was occupied. When I noted that it was what was on my reservation, she said ""we don't do that."" 


That should have been my first clue. 


Cut ahead - 10 minutes, 20 minutes, a full 30 minutes and no one has come to take even a drink order. We just sat there waiting. Honestly, 30 minutes. It was so bad, that the person who filled the water and brought bed noted the lack of service and apologized. 


Finally, after 30+ minutes, I went looking for help. I found the hostess and told her no one had come to even get our drink order. She seemed frustrated and apologized. I was embarrassed for my party, at my birthday celebration. 


Another ten minutes and still nothing - no one even checks. I get up again to go find someone and find the same hostess. I say ""still - not even a drink order - 45 minutes after being seated."" She says again that she'll find our server and starts asking people - have you seen so and so? 


I say, can someone just come get our drink order at least? Anyone? She says she'll do it and walks over with me, back to the table. Problem is, she has no idea what's on the drink menu. So, she can't really help at all. Everybody is now hungry and frustrated. 


Another ten minutes - nothing. Pushing an hour now and I'm done. I get up a third time and go find the hostess - I still have no idea who our server is supposed to be. I tell my family that we're done, we're leaving and we begin to pack up. 


When I find the hostess, I say it's been nearly an hour and we have nothing and that we're leaving. I say, just bring me the check for the drinks. I expect her to say no, that she's sorry and since I did not get the drinks, that's fine. But she doesn't - she goes and gets the check. So I, not wanting to get even more angry, just hand her my credit card. 


So, I end up paying, I think, $80 for the reservation and another $120 for drinks we never got and wasted an hour waiting for anyone to come by.  Not counting the extra tip to get the table I wanted, which I didn't get either. 


Also, the place is very dated - as in holes in the table cloth. At one point, I moved my chair and the slip cover came off, revealing torn foam padding underneath from a chair that had clearly broken and the management just decided to put covers over them. Gross. 


Bottom line, I was deeply embarrassed and frankly stunned by the complete failure - ignoring me for so long and charging me for literally nothing. 


This should be the best restaurant in Chicago given its location, but it's not. It's the worst place I've ever tried to eat in Chicago and among the worst ever. Just terrible.",,Bad,Bad
This might be the only restaurant in Chicago with a cover charge. $20 per person admission plus 20 percent service fee added to the bill. It‚Äôs ridiculously overpriced and the food is very average. Also why have a dress code then allow people in who dress down!,Bad,Bad,Bad
"I booked this restaurant for my husband's birthday. I was excited to see the pictures where we could sit and look out the window as the sun set and have a romantic dinner. It was anything but romantic!!


First of all I should say, our server was FANTASTIC!!! She was on top of it and so sweet and attentive. I give her rating a 5+. The rest of the visit is a ZERO.


The restaurant is dirty and aging. From the moment we sat down I knew this wasn't going to be good. The blinds were all damaged and mismatched throughout the restaurant. The carpet wad dirty and the trim was falling apart. We had received a call earlier in the day letting us know the dress code. My husband was in a suit and I was in a lovely dress. Others were in run down clothes, or shorts, even jeans.


The meal was AWFUL! I have been to $ restaurants that were better. I ordered a medium filet and ended up needing to eat it with sips of water. It was so dry and tasteless. My husband ordered the lobster and steak combo (for $130 might I add!) and he was sadly disappointed in the flavor. The only good part was the salad and that was even watered down.


I was in tears by the time we left because this was not the experience I had hoped for for my husband's birthday. After spending $400 I would have thought we would have left being fully satisfied. We didn't even eat half of our meals it was that bad.


And PS is it super distasteful to have a photographer walk around and interrupt you meal asking to take pictures, then charge you for those pictures. Classy restaurants DO NOT DO THAT!!!!


This restaurant really needs to rethink it's prices, and clean the place up.  We will NOT ever return and have already told our friends who live in Chicago and others who visit regularly to not visit. I hate doing that as I love supporting all types of businesses, but this one I just cannot support.",Bad,Bad,Good
"If I could give 0 I would. On June 1st, my brother got engaged. I called Cite to arrange for a champagne toast to be brought to his table (because it says they do this on the website). I asked if I needed a credit card authorization form (because it says they do this on the website). The hostess rudely said no, we don't do that. The hostess then spoke with the bartender who said she could do cocktails instead, they are about $20 each. I said ok, please charge $40 to my card then, and let my brother know they're from me. I checked my bank account a few days later and was charge $395! I have been calling all week, speaking with Antonio the Manager who apologizes and says someone will get back to me. I am  emailing the contact listed on their website. No responses. I am demanding a refund for the overcharge and am getting silence. Absolute worst customer service and professionalism I've ever seen. Avoid.",,Bad,Bad
"This place is a complete and total FRAUD!!!! Outback Steak House is better. The website makes this place look fantastic. The dress code, ambiance and the price gave us the impression this place was upscale. It could not be farther from the truth. We paid almost $400 a couple for dinner and the moment we walked in, there were people with jeans and tennis shoes on. The carpet was filthy, and the whole place was in disrepair, the chairs had old seat covers to hide the rips in the leather seats. One bathroom was out of order and the other looked like a gas station. We sat by the window filled with spiders and you could barely see out because of the dirt. The waiter was so dishonest, he made us believe he was giving us things that were included in our meal just to give us an additional $368 bill on our way out. If this restaurant stays open another 6 months, I'd be surprised. Never go here if you are visiting Chicago. This is the worst ""high-end"" restaurant I've ever seen and I've been to a few.",,Bad,Bad
The views of the sunset during dinner were amazing but that was the only good part. First we get seated and my husband got the romance package with the roses on the table but as soon as we sat down the waiter removed all the settings before I could even get a picture. We order drinks and literally are dying sweating in the restaurant!! All the other customers were complaining as well. I don't get how a fine dining establishment doesn't have central air and some sort of air ventilation. Next we ordered the scallops for a starter you literally get 2 little scallops for $24!?! With is 2 scallops going to do. I ordered the filet mignon well done because I am expecting so I can't have any rawness. It literally was burnt and tasted like roast beef! My husband got the Delmonico ribeye he said was good but overcooked as well. The waiter was nice but one of them that filled the waters kept trying to rush to take my plate before I even finished my food. The photographer was nice but definitely a little bit too persistent. We ended up buying the $12 picture for memory purposes. Felt bad my husband tried so hard with our 15 year anniversary and it just went so badly because of the restaurants service.,Bad,Bad,Bad

"Made a reservation for Valentines Day and was extremely DISAPPOINTED! The hostess was extremely rude and we were seated at a window seat that had no view after we were showed a much nicer table that was given to someone else. The V-Day Menu was a disaster..$175 a person plus $80 tip included in the bill. The menu barely had any options and the food was barely mediocre. Dinner for 2 cost us $500 plus $20 parking.

On the night I was there (first time visit), it just so happened to be Restaurant Week in Chicago.  There were few special 3 course meals including soup or salad, main meal, and a dessert.  The entire meal was excellent.  I went with the lobster bisque soup, the Filet Mignon with peppercorn sauce, and the cheesecake dessert.  I even asked for a substitute of the choice of potatoes with no trouble at all.  The restaurant staff was very nice and accommodating.They are definitely there to please their guests in any way they can.  Next time I am in town, I want to return.

This was by far the worst NYE experience. My fianc√© hasn‚Äôt been able to celebrate NYE is 10 years due to her working in the food and beverage industry and usually has to work. She was finally off and we were able to finally celebrate together. We bought last minute tickets for $250 each for a 6 course meal.y fianc√© is pregnant and the food needed to be prepared a certain way which we specified in the beginning. They brought the soup out which was cold but we decided to eat it anyways. Next was the duck that we said needed to be well done for her. They brought it out medium rare so we sent it back to be re cooked. They left my duck and we waited about 10-15 min for her new one to come out.  I waited to eat mine and by the time hers came out mine was cold and never offered to give me a new one or take it when they took hers. Next was our steaks. Hers came out rare. Again we sent it back. They took the same meat and cooked it longer which took another 10-15 min longer. It still was medium rare when she got it. They also didn‚Äôt offer to bring me a new one as I waited for hers to come out do we weren‚Äôt eating alone. Last was our dessert. We order a cr√®me br√ªl√©e and a cheese cake. They brought out a fondue. So we had to send that back and wait for the correct dessert. All in all we couldn‚Äôt enjoy our time together because we were continuously complaining and sending things back. Not once did a manager come to talk to us. I called a couple days later to explain the situation and the lady manager I spoke with said she would help us out and talk to the owner. I never received a call back and called again. They said they needed more time and said they probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to do anything and that she still wasn‚Äôt able to talk to the owner. I have been trying to call a few times a week and now they are ignoring my calls. Their customer service especially from a management stand point as been very unprofessional.,Bad,Bad,Bad

The boyfriend had duck and it appeared a bit undercooked, but it is so dark in there - it was hard to tell. He did, coincidentally, spend a lot of time in the bathroom the next day.

"We dined here to celebrate my husband's 70th birthday. We initially were seated away from.the window so asked to be moved. The view was excellent but the food not so. We had the tasting menu which was nothing like any other tasting menu I had ever had! Tasting menus are meant to be small tasting portions of food spread over a set number of courses this was just plates full of food and nothing like a tasting menu should be. The beetroot and goats cheese course was just a large plate full of chopped beetroot with 2 tiny pieces of goats cheese in it!
The service is very haphazard with no one seeming to know what they are doing. We wanted to order a bottle of wine but the food arrived before the order was even taken! Another course was brought before the previous one had been cleared, it was just like watching a comedy programme!

WIndow seat with beautiful views over Lake Shore Drive, very Good, great wine, attentive service, and not nearly as crowded as the Signature Room. Better views too, expecially once the sun goes down.

He had a special day planned Sugar Factory, Navy Pier, A play and dinner at Cite's restraint with beautiful view. The day went great sending photos all day, when they arrived at Cite they sat the 2 in front of a broken window that was all fogged up. When they asked for new seating they said they could sit them away from the window with no view. They chose to sit there because it was reserved 2 months in advance and the view was part of their day. They loved the food but view sucks and no apology. all of their memory photos were beautiful except were it should have been the best, I wish everyone could see this picture that they paid for it was nothing but a dirty window behind them.

They brought us a complimentary lump crab that was terrible - dry with no flavor. We got the steak tartare as an appetizer, which was so bad that we couldn't get past the first bite. We had intended to eat dinner, but no one asked us for a dinner order, and the steak tartare was so bad that we decided to leave and go somewhere else for food. Service was very poor - slow and inattentive.",Bad,Good,Bad
The view from Cite was excellent and I think the really the best thing about this restaurant. Although the restaurant does not revolve you can walk around and get fantastic views of the amazing Chicago skyline. The restaurant is located near Navy Pier but you really would not know it is there. The menu choices are standard fare for this type of venue very meat and potatoes veg oriented. Our dinner was not exceptional which considering the price you pay felt off. Service was slow and to be honest restaurant looked and felt tired like it was in a need of reno. Night we were there woman‚Äôs washroom was out of order.,,,Bad
"Seriously, one would never know from the street or lobby there is a restaurant in this building!


While visiting my best friend, she and her partner chose the spot, known mostly to locals.   The entrance is inside a high rise, through a hallway, up two seperate elevators, to a high skyline view. 
The bar had live piano entertainment.  The music was pleasurable while we sipped our pre dinner drink.  There isn't a bad seat in the house - all are at a window or at an eye level where the view is unobstructed.  Wait staff is friendly and on point. The food was amazing!


A funny quirk is the photographer who comes around to take your picture, assuming all diners are there for a special occasion.  We took the bait.  The photographer was sure to arrange the table setting and our positions so the photo would look nice.  A pleasant little memory for each of us to remember a lovley evening as we watched the sun set over the city.",Good,Good,Good

"We had a reservation for July 4th which was fixed price 4 course meal for $145. There were two choices for each course. While the server was very nice there were many problems with the evening. Delivery of food and drinks was a very slow process, sometimes waiting 30 minutes for a drink or the next course. This made no sense to us as they knew what food was to be ordered by how many people. While the view of the fireworks were very nice it could not make up for the horrible service. Food was lukewarm at best. At the end we tried to speak to the manager and were told the manager had left and that the actual management was in Miami and offered a number to call the next day. Unbelievable. This was one of my worst dining experiences anywhere.",,Bad,Good
"The food was delicious! As a vegetarian, I was very pleased with my options. The food came in a timely manner and the captain and server assistant were extremely friendly. The captain was very accommodating and helped us order based on our food preferences and restrictions. The server assistant was very attentive and lively when he came by. It was a really relaxing time and the view of the skyline, Lake Shore Drive and the lake was unbeatable! Dining while the sun was setting was the highlight of the night. There was also a photographer there to capture the moment too. I would definitely come back and tell more of my friends to come.",Good,Good,Good
"I dined here on July 13th for date night with my husband on Saturdays, we like to try new places to dine and this place was more then I expected, The view from our table was of the skyline of downtown and we both enjoyed filet mignon with asparagus, it was so delicious, i wanted seconds. the wait staff was so nice and catered to us as if we where family. The hostess accommodated our seating preference since I didn't want to see navy pier and the restaurant had a very vintage feel that we adored. I would definitely come back here. Great view, food and drinks",Good,Good,Good
"This is by far one of the best place to dine in all of Chicago. From the hostess seating us by the windows where we could see the fire works to the service - everything was simple perfect.

"Cant beat the view however the restaurant has seen better days.  No ambiance (just the view), cobwebs, limited menu and horrid air conditioning.  They have temporary units set up - but I honestly could not eat my meal due to the meager air conditioning. Wait staff was wonderful - this place has just been passed up and hasn't felt the need to update unfortunately.  Located in a residential apartment building - no signage whatsoever.",,Bad,Good
"We saved this restaurant experience for our last night in Chicago. We had had fantastic dining experiences during the week. We could laugh off the fog and the fact we could see nothing but as the meal began to unfold we could laugh no longer. They did not have the wine we ordered (Pouilly Fum√©) so we were offered an alternative more expensive one at the same price. Fair enough. 
The aircon had us putting on our jackets.
Starters: French onion soup, OK, Lobster bisque, lukewarm and sloppily served.Risotto: could make better myself.
Sides: mushrooms cold, potato gratin cold and not fresh. Had to send back to be heated.
Mains: not warm enough and very ordinary. Was that sauce supposed to be the cauliflower pur√©√©?
This is a restaurant clearly trading on a previous good reputation and not bothering to keep it up. Of course the prices are still those of a top class restaurant!  We did not stay for dessert. As we went for the elevator we felt like warning the arriving guests to turn back. Like us they had high expectations.",Bad,Bad,
"Truly a ""Bucket List"" Chicago experience. The restaurant is round and 70 floors up with stunning panoramic views of the Chicago skyline and Lake Michigan.


The food was an epicurean delight both delicious and satisfying. If you need comfort after a long trip, try the tomahawk steak and the lobster mac n chez... perfect for meat eaters; however, they have impressive vegetarian dishes for the more sensitive among us too. :)


The service was outstanding. They are cultured and knowledgeable creating an all around wonderful experience.

The interesting part is going from main building door to restaurant door. I had a blast having and doorman opening downstairs, taking one elevator and then walking and taking another one with nobody in sight. 
The place could be in much better shape althought it is in good shape. There were binder clips to hld curtains I think...in the windows. They had no central air working so they had these huge machines  that were ugly and loud, specially if you were seated next to them like we were plus we were in front of the kitchen so the waiters would keep coming and going pushing carts full of plates and glasses that they almost were spilled on us several times. So it was an uneasy situation going on while dinning.  Plus you could hear the people in the kitchen talking. We are just simple easygoing people so it was just a little bit annoying but it can be an issue for other people. To be far away from them you had to miss the city skyline view and just have the lake view. The place is 360 degrees floor and kitchen and bar are in the centre so there is just a long hallways around where the tables are next to windows. 
Everyone is seated next to window and all is windows so you can have a spectacular view of the city. There are only a couple of tables not exactly at the windows but still only 2 meters away. 
Prices are expensive and portions are ok if you are European. For an American those are small. Food tasted delicious. The sides amount are huge though. 
There was a small bar with a piano but nobody played it. t could have been nice. 
The waiters were very professional, patient, caring, attentive specially Paola and Peter. 
There was a small incident whose fault was the restaurant and we were offered just free dessert. 
We want to come back because it is nice to have dinner with the amazing view of Chicago and suburbs skyline. But the whole experience could have been better for the price. I still want to recommend the spot. 
Parking is $20 after validating but I don't know for how long you can park. Navy Pier is just downstairs so it is very nice to go for a walk afterwards or enjoy fireworks just while eating. 
Menu is limited. We compared it to the dining room in a cruise.",Good,Bad,Good
"This is the one of the best places to patronize if you want stunning and breathtaking views of the Chicago skyline: just beautiful whether during the day, sunset or evening. This is perfect for a celebration, romantic or a very special occasion.
Atmosphere: hush (in a good way), a little old school yet elegant.  You‚Äôd want to be attired appropriately because of the atmosphere. 
Staff: impeccably professional, attentive, excellent service and friendly.
Food: there were about 15 in our party so we had the prix fixe menu with 3 courses. I had salad, roasted chicken which was tasty along with the sides which which accompanied it and a yummy chocolate mocha cake: all were elegantly presented and served.  The serving sizes were appropriate because it‚Äôs a fine dining establishment. I also had a couple of glasses of Pinot Grigio. In terms of food I‚Äôd select other places to dine but the point of the visit was to celebrate and the views were absolutely worth it. 
Price: The total cost with tip was under $100 per person which was reasonable.
Would I return: yes, yet for appetizers and drinks at the bar just to leisurely gaze at the skyline.",Good,Good,Good
"Staff is excellent and makes up for food that is nice but ordinary. 
Really had an Amazon view from day to beautiful sunset. 
Enjoyed the experience altogether.",,Good,Good
"Easter brunch at Cite was a disaster!!!! The temperature had to have been between 90-100 degrees depending on where you were seated. It was so hot we could not even enjoy the buffet. We heard multiple different excuses ‚Äúit‚Äôs an old building‚Äù ‚Äúwe are so high up that it‚Äôs hard to control the temperature‚Äù ‚Äú we aren‚Äôt allowed to turn the AC on until May‚Äù. There were men in there in full suits with their pant legs rolled up past their knees. Worst of all was the manager. She was so rude when I tried to talk to her. She literally told me she couldn‚Äôt discuss anything at the time and asked my name and how many people were in my party. Never asked for a phone number but stated ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have someone call you‚Äù. Still waiting for that call.... website stated bottomless mimosas and bellinis with the pre paid buffet. Apparently the website was wrong because no drinks were included. My husband and I dine out a lot and I have to say this was the worst experience maybe ever! I felt the worst for the waiters and the kitchen staff sweating while they worked! 


Long story short, ask what the temp is before trying to dine here. They should have warned us when we walked in and gave us the opportunity to go somewhere else.",,Bad,Bad
"My children and I had Thanksgiving dinner here. The service was absolutely wonderful. The view was spectacular, with every table placed along the windows, so you can‚Äôt get a bad seat. Plus, it feels private and uncrowded that way. Food was very good, with a menu full of our favorite highbrow dishes, like steak tartare. Though I wouldn‚Äôt say the steak tartare was the caliber that you‚Äôd find in Paris or even at NY‚Äôs 21, it was pretty darn tasty, as was everything else. A photographer was available to memorialize our visit. It was very expensive, but for a special occasion, worth the splurge.",Good,Good,Good
"We decided to celebrate new year of 2019 at Cit√© with a view and a preset 6 course dinner. 


Wait staff- the Moroccan gentlemen who was helping us was nice, however at one point almost gave us attitude when was asked to take back a raw scallop.  He said "" The kitchen is very busy, everyone ordered at the same time"".  -still no excuse to serve undercooked seafood.  


Food- the sturgeon caviar was simply a full table spoon of butter on a Cracker.  
The duck was very chewy and cold. ( many dishes this evening were served cold). 
Crab cakes - tiny previously frozen and not artfully baked crab cakes were not enjoyable to say the least.  
They forgot to bring out a course of the menu. 
Lobster bisque was cold and felt like it was out of the can. 
Lobster tail was chewy and cold, the steak was tiny and not tasty at all.  
Deserts were good.  
Drinks were good


The wait staff did not provide champagne in time for New Years.  That part of our night was very upsetting as we all were looking forward to cheering together when the clock stricken 12.   They basically robbed us of that experience.  


Ambiance did not call for celebration all evening long.  Sadly. 


All of this experience was only $3000 for our group of 7.  
Very disappointed in Cit√®, will complain to the management.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The food was really good, the view we stunning, all the personal was very professional and friendly at the same time, I definitely recommend this place :)",Good,Good,Good
Went here for a first date. It was a crazy Good. Awesome food and awesome view. I definitely will be coming back. It‚Äôs obviously a bit pricey. Only complaint is I wish they had self parking at the place because I don‚Äôt want to valet park my manual transmission car. So I had to park in navy pier and walk but that wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal.,Good,Good,
"This is certainly the place to go if you are looking for lovely views of the Chicago skyline from 70 stories up.  We really enjoyed our dinner here although it started out a bit awkward.  We ordered a glass of wine upon arrival in lieu of a cocktail and our waiter poured the wine into our water glasses.  He caught himself but that required new water glasses followed by a discovery that we didn't have any napkins on the table when they presented the bread basket.  The meal was good but not exceptional.  I love escargot but mine arrived over done - the garlic butter was charred on the plate so the accompanying puff pastry was rather dry to eat and it was left on the plate.  The steaks we had were also good but nothing exceptional.  That said, we really enjoyed ourselves here.  It was a special time as a family and it will be memorable for the views and the time we spent together.",,Good,Bad
"We made a reservation by phone under the following premise: ""We are fully available for any time from 7 PM on. No matter what time but we want a table with a very good view"". Guess what? They had our reservation but the first thing they did is offering a table looking towards the pitch dark sea, that's with no view. We asked for another table and we were given ""the only other option"" they could offer us. This second option was not even close to a good one but at least it was better than the first option.
The quality of food is good. We had a tomahawk steak with mash potato, mushrooms and asparagus. The meat was ok and the mushrooms great. The bill? You can count on paying around 100 USD per person + Wine (bear in mind that taxes are not included in the price of the menu).


Bottom line, the place is worth a visit, but just that, one visit in your life. The service is way below the standards of a restaurant of that category and the food is just ok. If you decide to give it a try I strongly recommend you to literally ask by phone the following:
""I WANT A TABLE JUST IN FRONT OF THE BAR OR RIGHT NEXT TO THE PIANO""
If they cannot grant you that, do not even go. Those are pretty much the only tables with GOOD views.",Good,Bad,Bad
My fianc√© proposed to me at this restaurant and it was the perfect place. The wait staff were very friendly and accommodating. They were able to find us a nice secluded spot with a beautiful view of the skyline. They did everything they could to make the evening perfect and even recorded the proposal. I want to thank Amir and his staff for a lovely evening. We will definitely come back. The food and ambiance was perfect.,Good,Good,Good
"I recently proposed to my girlfriend here and cannot express how perfect it was.  The music, the views, the ambiance are all absolutely perfect for a romantic night with a SO.  Huge shoutout to Amir and the rest of the wait staff, they were more than accommodating.  They provided ideas on how I should pop the question, they set us up with a secluded table alone, and they gladly (and sneakily) filmed the proposal.  And on top of all that, the food and service were amazing as well.  Try the lobster bisque!  We will definitely be returning, as Cite as officially become 'our' spot! :)",Good,Good,Good
I cannot give a thorough review on the meals however I recently attended for a cocktail reception and was very very impressed.  They had a wonderful and delicious selection of cheeses and hor d'oeuvres that were actually amazing.  I‚Äôm a picky person and I thought the quality of the food was very high. I cannot speak for their meals. They also had a pretty good wine selection.  Certainly the view takes the cake.,Good,Good,
"Our son and daughter-in-law celebrated their second wedding anniversary and my birthday at Cite'.  The atmosphere can be a bit socially daunting at first, but our Table Captain Peter went right along with the carefree and fun spirit of our family, which made the evening more memorable than we could imagine. 
We arrived in the lobby prior to 5:30 p.m. and had to wait there until the restaurant opened.  We wanted to dine early so we could enjoy the view the city as the sun was setting.  It was amazingly breathtaking, but the restaurant does NOT revolve as another person had reviewed it does.  It doesn‚Äôt need to as the windows go all the way around.
Jackets and ties are not required, but do yourselves a favor, dress the part to match the ambiance in which you are dining.  Why spend good money on a quality meal and dress down as though you were going to Chili's.
Jocelyn, who I understood was ""filling in"" that evening was superb as a server to our table.  She had a smile that melted us and a personality that was fun.  Her service was attentive and we were grateful we had her.  The evening wouldn't have been the same.
Our drinks were worthy of high compliments.  When you pay good money for a cocktail, you want to taste the alcohol.  Hats off to the bar tender that evening, Monday, October 8, 2018.
Our First Course met our expectations and beyond.  We started with Ahi Tartare, Prime Beef Tartare and Diver Sea Scallop and Shrimp Duo for 3 of us couldn't have been better unless there was more.
The Butternut Squash Lobster Bisque, French Onion Soup, and Heirloom Tomato with Burrata Cheese Salad were seasoned just right.  
Our Main Course included Pan Seared Scallops, Alaskan Wild King Salmon Crusted with Sesame Seeds, 
 And 8 oz. Filet Mignon were prepared to perfection and the Creamy Risotto on which the Pan Seared Scallops rested was divine.  


Peter prepared our Bananas Foster gift tableside, as is standard, except he provided flaming fun with the show.  It made the dessert that much better while others enjoyed Cr√®me Brulee.  
My mouth is watering whilst I author this review.
Do not go to Cite' simply for the panoramic view of the city and Chicago lakefront.  It is stunning, but you will be disappointed if that is your goal.
Go to Cite' for the upscale yet unpretentious atmosphere, the perfectly mixed cocktails sure to satisfy, the Continental cuisine prepared by a meticulously skilled chef, yummy desserts, and a Front House Table Team that makes your dining experience memorable until the next visit.
Peter, you and your team made our night and a celebration we will never forget!  
Thank you.  Thank you.

"The view was spectacular, even though it was a cloudy evening.  The food was very good.  Lamb chops were ""the best he ever had"".  Pork chop was delicious, scallops were good.  Filet-mediocre.  Appetizers were good.  Bananas Foster was good too.
Service was NOT good.  Had to hunt down waiter.  Brought wrong drinks.  Had to wait for drinks.  Had to ask for bill multiple times.  Nice man but not quite on top of the service.  
They had an excellent piano player.  Played a nice variety of numbers and not too loud or too soft.  Enjoyable evening, wish the service could have measured up.",Good,Good,Bad
"A bit of a disappointment.  The views are breathtaking as the restaurant revolves and gives you just outstanding views of Chicago. The service was also very good.  The wait staff was very attentive and frequently visited the table. Where we were disappointed was with the quality of the food. Prices are really high for average meals. We started with the Ahi Tuna Tartare and it was bland. The Butternut Squash Lobster Bisque was really good a full of flavor, I could have eaten 2 cups. The Alaskan Wild King Salmon Crusted with Sesame Seeds was  overcooked. The Delmonico Beef Rib Eye had good flavor but was cooked well done vs med rare. Overall the food is so so and pricey. If we go back would consider a few drinks and appetizers rather than ordering a meal.",Bad,Good,Good
"We brought our family here for dinner thinking it was a rotating restaurant. It sits on the 70th floor, and has 360 views of the city, but it doesn‚Äôt rotate. The food was pretty decent, I think the best was the salmon! The service was excellent, and around 9:30 the firework show from the navy pier started (this was a really neat, unexpected surprise)",Good,Good,Good
"I took my family to Cite on recommendation of our hotel concierge. We were exited to get there and when we saw the amazing night views of the city and lake we were even more excited to be there. However, our food experience fell short of being as exciting as the views. The lobster bisque was not creamy and tasted more like tomato soup, the scallops in the risoto were not cooked properly and the filet minion was not the proper cut of meat-it was dry and stringy and looked more like pot roast. We returned the food and chaned it for something else. The staff remained polite the eintire time and made our experince wonderful despite the chefs' cooking mishaps.",Bad,Good,Good

"I had dinner at Cite on the evening of 22 August 2018, my only night in Chicago after this trip to the USA.  This is one of the few times I have made a reservation without checking the TripAdvisor reviews.  And I really wish I had done so.


I have been fortunate to eat in many wonderful restaurants around the world and chose Cite because of the wonderful views that are portrayed on their website.  OK, so the views from the restaurant are nice, especially around sunset.  You have lovely views over Chicago, and, if you are on the correct side of the restaurant, the harbor too.


But you know you are in for an average experience when the waiter has food stains on his tie and marks on his jacket.  This is just not acceptable in a restaurant that is supposedly of reasonably good quality.  It‚Äôs the small things that create the biggest impressions and this put me off right away.


Probably beyond the control of the restaurant, but the (external) windows are filthy.  They are covered in grime and there are old spiders‚Äô webs right alongside your table.  I am not sure whether this can be addressed by the restaurant but they should make every effort to do so as this just distracts from your meal.


The restaurant has not been updated for many years.  There is a nasty brown carpet that looks like it came from a 1980s hotel.  The d√©cor is dated and really starting to lose the battle against time.  The ambiance is not great.  And the air-conditioning is turned down so low that you would think they are trying to freeze fish from the local market.


To be fair, the food was OK but not exceptional.  The whole experience was not wonderful.  If I was to visit Chicago again I certainly would NOT choose Cite restaurant.  I must, however, compliment a lovely hostess by the name of Susan who gave me some wonderful ideas of what to do around Chicago on my final day.


All in all a VERY AVERAGE experience.  I suggest that you could do a lot better by going somewhere else.  The restaurant could do well by investing in I) major updates to the d√©cor to reflect the 21st century, II) cleaning the external windows and removing the spiders‚Äô webs, and III) putting the waiter‚Äôs uniforms / tie through the laundry.",,Bad,
"Obviously an incredible view; however, the food was top notch. Some of the best Ahi I have had. Staff was attentive. Place also has a very personal and small feel.",Good,Good,Good
It was my first time to Chicago and I was looking up restaurants to eat at that would give us an incredible view of the city. I came across this restaurant and decided to give it a try. It did not disappoint! Food was delicious and the service was great too! We will be back!,Good,Good,Good

"I am writing my first ever Trip Advisor review because our experience was so horrendous and offensive.  I have never been treated so poorly in my life.  Short version:  they tried to move up our reservation for our 1st Anniversary at the last minute by accusing me of lying and creating a fake reservation confirmation email.  When that didn't work, they tried to bully us into coming earlier, and then tried to make us feel guilty that we were keeping everyone at the restaurant on Mother's Day.


My husband and I made a reservation on April 12 at Cite for our 1st Anniversary.  We received a confirmation email for May 13 at 8:30pm (see attached photo).  I called on May 11 to confirm and to request a window table.  The man I spoke with confirmed the details-everything was pleasant.  At 6:40pm on May 13, the restaurant called to tell us to be prompt for our reservation as they were keeping the elevators on for us and the workers wanted to get home to their families.  The man very quickly stated the reservation time as 8pm and hung up before I could clarify.  I called back and clarified our reservation was 8:30pm.  He told me it was not 8:30pm, it was 8pm.  I told him my email said 8:30pm and I had verified May 11.  I explained this was our 1st Anniversary, that we were trying to enjoy drinks before dinner, and I was spending time talking with him while my husband sat alone.  I asked to speak to his manager, he told me he was the host on duty.  He put me on hold to get the chef, but returned 5 minutes later to tell me he had left.  I again mentioned I confirmed May 11 and had the confirmation email.  He said he had notes from the May 11 call that matched what I was saying, but that it was 8pm.  How convenient.  I read him my confirmation email and he told me they had no record of the email.  I asked him how I received an email that said 8:30pm, and he said such an email did not exist because if it did, he would be able to see it.  He essentially called me a liar and accused me of creating a fake email.  I re-read the email to him, verifying their email address and the structure of the email and at that point, realizing I had caught him in his lie and he could not argue with the email, he told me that he'd make a one-time exception and allow us to arrive at 8:30pm.  I told him I appreciated him honoring their commitment, and he snapped back at me to arrive promptly at 8:30pm because we'd be their last table and everyone had families to get home to and celebrate Mother's Day with.


What a SCAM.  I think what happened is it was Mother's Day, we were their last and only table past 8pm, and he thought he could call us and trick us into thinking we messed up the time of our reservation and bully us into arriving at 8pm so he could go home.  I understand that Mother's Day is a long and tiring day for those working at restaurants--my husband has worked at a restaurant and we have family that own a restaurant.  But that is not an excuse to treat customers this way.  I wish I could say his rudeness did not affect our evening, but it did.  We were no longer comfortable going there to eat, and ended up having to go back to our hotel and order room service because it was too late to get a reservation anywhere else so last minute.  Not to mention our pre-dinner drinks were completely ruined with me on the phone and then us scrambling to make other plans.  I am so appalled.  Do not entrust these people with your time or special evenings.  I am so sorry that we did.",,Bad,Bad
"Not just the stunning views are worth a visit. The Waiter as well was polite and courteous in a all natural kind of way so the stay was a real excitement. I had the beef tenderloin, which was totally cooked to my liking. Also the cocktails and the wine left nothing to complain about. 
In my Eyes totally worth a Visit!
Especially the charges for happy hour menus (5:30 to 7:30 pm.) are very good price. Normal Dishes cost quite a bit more but in are in a good price value range.
I ll definitely come back on my next Chicago visit
Enjoy your Visit there",Good,Good,Good

The place, atmosphere were great, specially, at new year night.
the only one thing was surprising me is the prices in this restaurant.",Good,Good,Good
"Cite is a bit of a secret.It‚Äôs hidden on the 70th floor of Lake Point Tower. Specializing in French influenced American food, their menu offers decent choices and is actually quite reasonable given that your enjoying your meal with one of the most sweeping city views you‚Äôll ever get to see. 


We arrived early but were promptly seating right next to one of the windows. It was a very clear night so we can see from Navy Pier clear across the south and west. Just wonderful. 


Several beef and seafood options. More or less everything comes with some sort of reduction. 


We had the butternut squash lobster bisque -it was excellent in our opinion. 


We also had the sea bass and New York strip. The sea bass flaky and flavorful, and at $32 seemed like bargain. The NY strip with a side of wild mushrooms was also good. The steak was cooked right but still seemed a touch tough. The reduction added a flavor I don‚Äôt normally have with my beef. It was good-but I‚Äôm more of a meat purist-I like it served up salt and pepper only. The mushrooms were excellent (and they were included in the order). At $50 -also a bargain. 


We also shared a lobster tail with drawn butter. It was as expected and enjoyed accordingly. 


Dessert was hazelnut cake. It was ok. Would try something else next time. I love hazelnut so for $9-it was worth a try. 


Parking ran me $20 even with validation-so that kind of sucked. 


I followed GPS to get there but luckily common sense took over just in time. You pull into the valet parking area from Grand Ave. 


Lastly-the service was very good. Appropriately attentive to our needs. 


It was a $235 experience for two with drinks but I felt it was worth it for the intimacy, elegance and spectacular views.",Good,Good,Good
"Wonderful high end restaurant with an amazing view and great staff. We made a last minute reservation on a Sunday night and because they had been a little slower that evening they were planning on closing a little early but took our reservation anyways. The staff was so polite and seemed to go out of their way to make us feel welcome. The food was phenomenal and perfectly cooked. I had the Rib-eye cut and she had the Chilean Sea bass both dishes were excellent. They also brought us out a sample appetizer that I cannot remember what it was. After dinner, we had a rather lengthy and delightful conversation with our waiter and then asked us to walk around the restaurant for a little bit and soak in the awesome view of the city at night. And then had our picture taken by the window. Absolutely a wonderful time.. Thanks",Good,Good,Good

Located on the top of Lake Point Tower, the only skyscraper on the east side of Lake Shore Drive, this circular restaurant provides gorgeous views!  Excellent staff dedicated to making your evening memorable. and the food was outstanding! The lobster risotto for the first course was exceptional. Pricey, but worth every penny.",Good,Good,Good
"Celebrated our 10th anniversary at Cite and were wowed by the entire experience. First, it‚Äôs quite romantic arriving by cab to the entrance of private residence! Doormen were so friendly and helpful. Two quick elevator rides to the top add to the mystique. The second elevator opens right into the restaurant reception. Greeted warmly and taken to two table that we were given choice of....both delightful little tables for two right at the window looking west and North. Watched the waves crashing over LSD in the windy conditions. It was beautiful?
The service and food were on par with the view. Our waiter was superb without being stuffy. Helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list. Husband had the five course tasting menu....loved all of it. Served beautifully and timely, but also in a way that did not leave me sitting watching him eat with nothing for myself. I had the duck which was SO delicious. Generous breast cooked to perfection and then a leg confi that was the most flavorful I‚Äôve ever had. Good cocktails, lovely wine suggestions for our meal. The entire evening was such a treat for ALL the senses!",Good,Good,Good
"First, BEST VIEW OF CHICAGO AND THE LAKEFRONT. Sunset and Navy Pier fireworks were the bomb. Amir was fantastic and his recommendations were spot on. If you don't know what you want, get the Chef's selection, a 4 course dinner experience. The wine selection is extensive for any palate.
Now the downside. Garage parking good for only four hours. At four hours and one minute, you are stuck with a $50 charge. Not Cite` fault. The building owner is not overly friendly to restaurant patrons.
Getting back to Cite`, the food was great, drinks excellent, service superb (Amir). I met the owner and her husband, George. Both were gracious and approachable. The restaurant appears dated in some places but, overall very clean and neat.
This is the restaurant for a special celebration, corporate reward or THAT proposal.",Good,Good,Good
"It‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs about the view. And it‚Äôs an amazing view of the city. But, if you‚Äôre  a foodie, it will disappoint. It‚Äôs pricy, which I don‚Äôt mind, but I expect good quality when pricy.

The view was amazing and unbeatable the ambiance was def  romantic. They were a bit unorganized in following the reservation seating and were just placing customers not by their reservation.

"All the way up to the 70th Floor. Cit (sight) e it is for sure. 
The elevator opens and to your left is the wonderful view of Chicago. 
I have to say this was my favourite part of the evening.
The food was good. My fillet mignon was super tasty as was the starter my husband ordered foie gros. His lobster was mediocre and pricy and the dessert was a bit of a let down.
The service however, I would say does not match the brilliant location and could be so much better.
Thankfully, we had a waitress that noted we were not in the best spot and moved us to a perfect view in front of the bar. Top tip to her.",,Good,

"I had visited Navy Pier and spotted an interesting looking place atop a nearby building.  Upon further online review, I determined it was ""Cite"".  I ordered the filet mignon and the cr√®me brulee for dessert.  Food took a while to come to the table, but, was well worth it.  The view from this establishment is AH-MAZING!  Staff is very friendly and attentive and encourages you to walk around the whole restaurant (it is shaped in a circle) to take in the views from all the way around.  Finding the entrance into the building was slightly challenging as it's a residential tower and I feel that an ""A frame"" sign would be very helpful to future travelers.",Good,Good,Good
"You feel welcome the minute you arrive. The hostess invited us to walk around to enjoy all the views of the city.

"Disappointed. Have been coming here for five years, introduced countless new customers to this restaurant. Ambiance is OK but it gets uncomfortably cold in there so make sure to bring a sweater.


Unfortunately, every time we visit the experience gets a bit worse. The view is truly the only reason I believe anyone would still come back. 
 
The service was terribly slow.


The bread that came out was old, warmed up probably in a microwave but within minutes got rock hard. 
The filet mignon was ordered medium rare, arrived medium well done.


When we spoke to staff about it, manager came to argue (yes, argue) that it actually was medium rare but we couldn't tell because of the lighting  (seriously??). This insult ensured we won't be recommending this place anymore.",Bad,Good,Bad
"Terrible service. My friend was in town so I invited him there for a nice dinner. I make the reservation and We arrive on time, they don't seat us by the window. So I tell the hostess that we would like to be moved if a table comes available. A table next to us does so I ask our head waiter Noah to move & he tells me he needs to check with the hostess. 10 min later we see the people on the next table moving to that window table. So I call the hostess who informs me that our main waiter Noah neglected to inform her & the table is gone. No apologies offered, just as she described it miscommunication!!!! We decided not to leave immediately even though we already ordered. A girl then comes up & give me a card & tells me you can call the morning manager if you want. When you are dinning in an upscale restaurant with an upscale price, the least thing you expect is a Good. McDonald's has better service that these people. It is really a shame as they have not elevated their service or their perception of it. Do not recommend at all.",,,Bad
"Always a spectacular view but food, drink and service  just not at the same level. 
 I ordered my cosmo with certain ingredients.   It didn't taste right when I finally did receive it.  When I asked the bartender he said they didn't have what I requested.  Tell me that before you bring me the drink please.  
They brought a good little meatball amuse bouche at the bar which was fun.


Dinner was okay, not great.  Caesar salad was pretty but tasteless.  Lobster and crab risotto was bland with little seafood.  Steaks were fine.  Service slow and seemed as if the staff was confused and there were only 3 or 4 tables? 


Very expensive for what we received.",Bad,Good,Bad
"The view is specatcular form with the round glass that looks out on the lake and the city. Make sure you arrive before sunset since viewing the sunset from here is amazing.  The food was high priced and good but not outstanding. I had the sirloin and it was a great value, but my friend had the on special wagyu steak for two at $105 and it was not that good even though the restaurant said it was the highest grade possible (9).",,Good,
"Visited Cite on July 3, a Monday, but a holiday-eve. Ambiance is amazing as you view Chicago... Drinks were superb (once they arrived, minus half a star)... Meal was phenomenal.  As a side, GET the lobster macaroni.  We ordered it to share, but I didn't want to share!!!",Good,Good,
this is one of the best restaurants in Chicago. Magnificent 360 degree views of the city from the 70th floor. withing walking distance of N. Michigan Ave. and Navy Pier. Food was delicious and the service is the best. Cap the night off with Bananas Flambe. Very romantic restaurant. We happened to be there the night of fireworks at navy pier so the view was excellent,Good,Good,Good
"We were new to Chicago, celebrating our first anniversary and I wanted a restaurant with spectacular views and the best food. I have traveled to a lot of major cities in the world and this is one of the best restaurants one can dine at. I was a little concerned with some of the negative reviews, especially in matters of courtesy so I decided to call them first. 


I can honestly say we were warmly welcomed and treated extremely courteously by every single person, right from the valet to the manager. I made it a point to remember their names before writing this review. John, whom I spoke to over the phone about the booking, expressed an earnest eagerness to serve us, Susan, who greeted us, showed us our table and congratulated us came across as a gentle and gracious host; and the very efficient Fabian who accommodated our every request with a smile. My wife was pregnant and developed a little back ache,so we asked for a cushion - it was there in a few minutes. We had Foie Gras, Oysters, Venison, Duck roast and Salmon. The Foie Gras was beyond perfect - heavenly! The other dishes too, were wonderfully cooked and well presented. For dessert, we had Banana foster - this is cream, butter and banana set on fire with a little rum - all cooked on a little stove at your table. Nothing like a little fire to add to the excitement of a fine evening. We did not have any wine on this occasion but one look at the menu can tell you there's everything for everyone. The manager dropped by to make sure we were having a good time. As we were leaving, the valet smiled and wished us well. If it helps, even the other guests around were cheerful, happy to take pictures for us and congratulated my wife. Even though I haven't tried other restaurants in the skyscrapers of Chicago, I doubt I'd go to any other place for a celebration. 


Here are my list of suggestions:
1. Dress at your best
2. Arrive on time or call if delayed
3. Though a table at the window is not guaranteed, it does help to ask while making the booking.
4. If you are interested in watching the fireworks, check the local schedules.
5. Valet parking is $20 is you get your ticket stamped by the restaurant.",Good,Good,Good
"It seems fitting that you have to go to the top of a building to have the fine, French-inspired food served here. This is a place proud of its food, proud of its service. Everything is very formal, even if some guests don't follow the business casual dress code. The impressive view is just an added value to a quality meal. We splurged on the caviar, served with six different accompaniments. The escargot was tender and savory, served with perfect little puff pastries. The duck breast and  confit leg were succulent and flavorful, and the pork chop, though thick and on the bone, was done to a turn, juicy and tender. The kale/cranberry side was a treat, the kale perfectly done.
This is not traditional French, but a high-end, artful variation on it. The impeccable service, the formal atmosphere, and the food make for a luxurious dinner. If you have the budget, this place is highly recommended.",Good,Good,Good
"Made the reservation for 3 and noted that there is the appearance that if they know you or are a regular that seating was a bit more 'selective'. I was a bit torn until I read some of the reviews good and bad but decided to try it out. The waiters were quite good and attentive. We were seated in a 'family' room, large parties and loud which is understandable.  We had to ask hosts to turn the blasting cooling unit that was right on our backs to be moved and redirected. There were large number settings and more tables for two than 4s which made it seem less options. We started with an appetizer but it never arrived but we got served quickly. The butternut squash lobster bisque with crab was decent but way too much different flavors. Simpler if it was lobster or the squash. French Onion soup according to our french onion connoisseur was too salty. The filet/steaks and salmon main courses were OK. Sides were good. Service was spotty, no spoons or saucer for our coffee. The dessert was the highlight and of course as the sun went down great views of the city and the Navy Pier. So overall there were little details that could have been and should have better considering the location our expectations were not met. I put that on the management. Having been a unit owner in the building for almost 40 years I would expect better.",Bad,Good,Good
"Ok, the restaurant does not revolve. But great food (we took the chef's menu), great portions (just enough), great wines, great recommendations and the best service. And the view is stunning. Good value for money. Don't forget if you don't go to Chicago all the time. And even then.",Good,Good,Good
"We don't impress easily...and, the view took our breath away! If it's your first time to Chicago (and the weather is clear!) you'll love the 70th floor view from CITE pronounced see-tay according to the building's bellman.


The view definitely gets a five star rating! And, the food and wine list were quite good but we reserve a five star rating for only magnificent food. 


I had the cold seafood platter appetizer (only $20) honestly it filled me up! As I suspected it would so I was glad I had the small Greek Salad as my entree. He had the filet mignon and our family ordered the tomahawk ribeye steak...which each couple split and they were glad they did! Lots of food....surprisingly reasonably priced considering the elegance and view.",Good,Good,
"We came here for my daughters birthday. The views were amazing and if your there at night, the city just lights up. You don't even feel that your 70 floors up! The food was amazing and was sad when the plate was empty. I recommend everyone try this place and we would definitely come back next time we are in Chicago!",Good,Good,
"We had an amazing time, breathtaking view, wonderful dinner and drinks. This was such a unique experience that was worth every penny. We had appetizers, a main course, dessert and a few different drinks and each and everything we tried was expertly prepared and absolutely delicious. The staff were beyond friendly and knowledgeable. We sat along the windows and the view of the city was just beautiful! We highly recommend experiencing this amazing restaurant and most definitely will come back year after year.",Good,Good,Good
"Evening dinner with friend.  Although it does not rotate, it does provide pretty views of the city at night.  We both opted for the Chef's menu which included their seafood risotto.  The whole trip was worth that and I haven't found a comparable.  It truly was rich and delicious!",Good,Good,
"This is the place for a romantic dinner with your spouse, partner or a new romantic interest. The rotating restaurant offers a panoramic view of the city and the lake.",,Good,
"We live nearby and went here for dinner after going to a matinee play at the Chicago Shakespeare Theatre. There was a promotion for early evening and we'd never been and we were among the first people there at 6 pm on a Saturday night. It was not that hard to find, at Lake Point Tower--the residential doormen were welcoming. The 7th floor restaurant was sparsely and almost makeshift- decorated but it was not that noticeable given it was dominated by the windows. It was foggy at first, but cleared to a spectacular view. Every seat is a window seat to some degree--either right next to it or in the more desirable banquettes facing it, and the views, while different are all great. So no seats are bad, tho at the window you do feel like the banquette people, once seated, are staring past you and it is a bit distracting. My partner pointed out that all the banquette-seated people were in cocktail attire with the men in jackets. It seemed odd that they had explicitly told us on the phone that the dress code was ""business casual."" I took that literally and was not aware that they might actually prefer fancier dress! (But he didn't want to suit up for an afternoon play we walked to in the rain, anyway.) The service was pretty good, even though we do not order wine or cocktails and were not dressed up. The food was well above average and portions large, prices typical. The Caesar salad was ""deconstructed"" and very good, large enough to split, which they did graciously. The bread was an assortment and came with a huge mound of butter which I always appreciate. We did not have room for dessert. We'd go again, under similar circumstances.",Good,Good,Good
"This would indeed be my first ONE star rating, undeservingly so, it is sad this disaster inhabits such a great space with a spectacular view. Fittingly so you are paying for a view alone. overpriced, sub-standard service I could go on and on however I would like to make this quick. There are now vast number of Penthouse Restaurants in Chicago so take my advice - Pass this one up - you will be disappointed, terrible location I really wish I could say something redeeming, but alas they are beyond redemption. And undeserving even of one star.",Bad,Bad,
"My daughter and I concluded the 
Chicago Dental Society Midwinter Meeting with a special meal at Cite.  The food and service was impeccable.  Awesome city views from the 70 th floor.  This is a restaurant in the round with wonderful views of lake and city.  Only open for dinner and a Sunday brunch, and dinner.  My next Sunday morning in Chicago I will be having brunch at Cite.",Good,Good,
Very good views of the city. Enjoyed the food but not necessarily outstanding. A bit pricey. Would recommend getting there early before they get busy.,Good,Good,
"Reserved New Year's Eve second seating at 10PM for 4 people @  $250 per person, not including beverages or tax and tip. It was a once in a lifetime trip to Chicago at that time of year, as I informed the reservations desk when I called to confirm my deposit, as requested by the restaurant. We were coming into town from California and asked for a table with a good view. The restaurant promised to do its best. Well, that turned out to be an hour and 15 minutes wait (standing at the reservations desk next to the jazz trio), during which the staff (a) said we'd be seated soon; (b) seated a party that arrived after us first; (c) after half an hour, the desk ladies professed not to know we were waiting for a table  (though what else 4 people dressed for an elegant evening out would be doing standing there for alI that time without moving I have no idea); (d) offered us a table that hadn't been cleared; the guests turned out to be in the restroom; and (e) didn't make the slightest gesture of apology. It was completely obvious that the restaurant had overbooked.


Only when I told the staff that they owed us at least free drinks did they do so. When we finally got our first course it was 15 minutes to midnight and the kitchen had started running out of energy. The food was old fashioned but OK; they forgot one of the courses and had to be reminded. We had to stand up to see the fireworks because we did not have a table with a view and if we hadn't stood waiting next to the music, we would not have heard a note because the table was at the opposite side of the restaurant.


Cite does have great views. I suspect it's best visited for a drink only after dark (it has a tiny bar); in bright light the place looks a bit shabby -- we noticed, because the staff started to clear up for the night while we were still eating our desserts.


Fortunately, our guests were good sports and we decided not to ruin the night by getting really angry on the spot. However, I think the restaurant's behavior was inexcusable and the ultimate in unprofessionalism.",Good,Good,Bad
"Cite has the best view in the city. Since it is farther away than the rest of the buildings, the views are unlike those in Hancock and Sear's Tower. 


As for the food, I went only for dessert. I enjoyed it immensely and ordered a second dessert while there. The service was also quite good.


I did hear that the table next to me had some issues with their food, but the servers seemed to take care of it.",Good,Good,Good
"Having visited Cite on New Year's Eve with friends, all I can say is wow!  This place is awful. The service was very sub standard, the food was average at the whole experience was such a let down. We ordered drinks at the table, two arrived the other after 20 mins. I asked for the drinks bill there and then which he said he would get ( didn't want to pay the 20% service charge that was on top of the meal price as they didn't deserve one) When we came to pay,the drinks bill had been put on with the meal price, so still ended up paying for the service. $1250 for 4 people , what a joke. Will not be back, and I hope people read this and have a good long think about wasting their hard earned money on this place!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Quite possibly the most disappointing dining experiences ever. Mediocre food, cooked poorly. Service was horrible. Staff darted about and never did anything. Like hey could you grab the drink I ordered from the bar sometime tonight. We sat on extremely old broken down furniture (my wife's chair seat was completely caved in) at cheap 20 year old Walmart folding tables covered in table cloths. Any comment to the staff went completely unheeded. Prices were ridiculous. Any Olive Garden has better food and service!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had the ""Chef's Tasting"" off of the menu, which was $89 each. It was absolutely amazing. Every course was made to perfection (asparagus salad, risotto, lamb, scallop, ahi tuna). The service was spot-on, with various servers clearing the dishes right after we finished, refilling drinks without prompting, and checking in.  The atmosphere is fine dining with a beautiful view, but still allowed for us to wear jeans. While the prices are more than you may be used to, it is worth the splurge!",Good,Good,Good
"the views are stunning especially at night when we dined. 
the service was good but the attention to detail was lacking. The food was ok but over priced - the fish dish was not great, my steak was over cooked and the sides were expensive. The asparagus was hard enough to shore up a building. The french would be upset!
In all you pay for a magnificent view but better food for less is available in many other areas of the city.",Bad,Good,Good
"This high-end restaurant at the top of the Lake Point Tower is the complete package. The food is delicious, the view is amazing and the service is also impeccable. Next time we are in Chicago, I will sure dine in the Cite again. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a one of a kind dining experience.",Good,Good,Good
"We went for the view and and it was spectacular.  While we were there, the gray skies gave way to partly cloudy and we watched the light play on the lake.  I had the mushroom omelette and it was tasty.  I also had the tomato bisque which was also good .  The service was excellent and allowed to linger visiting a friend who had trekked into the city.",Good,Good,Good
"I have no complaints! First, I made the reservation while my husband and I were driving to the city and asked for a table with a city view. The table was at the window and overlooked the city and Navy Pier. The wait staff were friendly and attentive. We ordered a bottle of wine which they decanted for us. There was lobster risotto on the chefs tasting menu. I did not want the whole menu but the chef accommodated me by making it a main dish. It arrived in a timely manner and was piping hot. My husband had the duck. It was delicious! It was moist but the skin was crispy. The flavors of the dishes we had meshed beautifully and we couldn't have been happier. Also while some places in the city are so loud we found this place to be quiet and romantic .",Good,Good,Good
"Disclaimer:  I am a foodie who enjoys seeking out the best restaurants wherever I travel.


My friend and I are so glad we ignored the poor reviews and ate at Cite for our first night in Chicago this week! When all was said and done, we rated last night's meal in the Top 3, all time, out of dozens of high-end dinners we've enjoyed together.


We arrived at 6:00 pm, about a half hour before sunset, and were utterly delighted with the fabulous panoramic views. (Cite is on the 70th floor of a building that sits on the shore; it has both city and lake views.) The views alone would have made the evening worth it, but we were truly delighted when the food started coming out of the kitchen. In a word, stellar!


We're not sure why some reviewers say Cite is ""pricey."" $24 for a generous piece and a half of perfectly prepared foie gras with to-die-for Amarena cherries and sauce, $14 for one of the best bowls of lobster bisque we've ever had (the lump crab was ""like butter!""), and $39 for three perfectly grilled and seasoned lamb chops or a plate of succulent duck with lick-the-plate-good sauce is about what one expects to pay at a fine dining establishment. The wine by the glass selection was quite good; we went with high end choices that did not disappoint for $14 per glass. 


The service itself was perfect. We did not have to ask for a thing, and our server was both knowledgeable and personable. As a bonus, the music (a mix of romantic and classic standards by artists old and new) was just perfect for the occasion.


I have no criticisms; our evening was a five-star experience.",Good,Good,Good
Food was good and the view is out of this world! The sides are rather pricey at $11 for broccoli. Shame we were put right next to the bar. The restaurant could do more to promote itself as we wouldn't of known it existed if it wasn't for the guide from our tour boat. Worth a visit.,Good,Good,
"This was meant to be a special birthday occasion & started off brilliantly. Our table was by the window with stunning views. The sommelier was extremely helpful and wine & meal ordered. Our wine arrived & then our starter salad with strawberries and pecans, just delicious. We then waited & waited and got colder & colder. We asked if the AC could be altered, but there was no change. Later we said we were getting very hungry & wondered how long our meal would be. Eventually it arrived an hour after our starter. My venison was tender and overall very good but not very hot. My husband had the lamb which he said was almost cold. I had also ordered asparagus which came 5 mins later. We were both so hungry by now we just ate our meals. It was disturbing to note that other customers were not being served and actually walked out. We did order the chocolate desert, perhaps a mistake. This eventually came but was not  very enjoyable, the chocolate sponge being very heavy.
We then asked for the bill. We got up to pay & my husband said he would not pay in full & certainly not the tip included in the bill. The waiter then disappeared. Eventually we asked to talk to the manager(also,the sommelier) who  apologised profusely & insisted that we did not need to pay!! 
In summary if they can sort out their AC and food deliverery I would certainly recommend this restaurant. Good luck.",Good,Bad,Bad
"This is my ""go to spot"" for my birthday dinner each year.  Food is pricey but delicious and lets be honest you are paying for the view.  We like to get there about 30 minutes before sunset so we can enjoy both the day time and night time views.  I usually get a groupon that saves me 50% (commonly available in the winter months).   If you just get entrees and no desserts or appetizers you do not need to spend a fortune.",Good,Good,
"My wife and I celebrated our 30th Wedding Anniversary at Cite on Sept 6th and had a fantastic time. Amir took great care of us, the food was delicious and the view was amazing. Can't wait to go back !",Good,Good,Good
"Had the opportunity to visit this restaurant a few times in the past year. Whether we were there for Thanksgiving dinner (regular menu), romantic dinner or a family get to-gether, this place has great food. Staff is attentive and the view is out of this world!",Good,Good,Good
"After a shaky start to the night the restaurant surpassed all expectations. I booked this for my fianc√© 30th birthday. When we arrived they had messed up the booking and did not have me on the list or my special menu prepared as stated. The hostess was a little rude saying she was doing her best to accommodate and that we had to be out by 8, rather than just get the manager and make it happen.
Anyway after that we got a table by the window, mind you almost all tables have incredible views, the manager came over, apologized and have us a free bottle of bubbly, and said we could have the table as long as we liked!
The good was exceptional, the service and waiter fantastic. This is definitely a place I would come back to and highly recommend it to anyone wanting a romantic dinner.
Make this a must in Chicago!",Good,Good,Good
"Dined here as part of a private (corporate) party that began with an open bar and hot appetizers.  Service was very attentive and the multi-course meal was very good (pre-set menu with options), but clearly, what Cite has to offer is a spectacular view of the city.  Cite is located on the top (70th) floor of a residential building.  Would highly recommend for anyone looking to impress their dinner guest(s).  My courses consisted of a salad, salmon and creme brulee, but others in our group had steak tartare, filet mignon and a decadent chocolate dessert.  Definitely a ""special occasion"" destination.",Good,Good,Good
Our second visit after our first visit 1 year ago. Our first visit was 4 hour disaster. This visit was better. The view is amazing. The food is very average and the facility needs updates.  Hope your a big wine drinker as they only have about 4 different types of beer. Our filet was really good and highlight of night. Oyster were horrible and were the largest oyster we have ever seen. Big is not always good. Go for the sites and not the food. Better yet. Grab a couple glasses of wine at the bar and save your 400.00 and go eat somewhere better.,Bad,Good,
"The view was absolutely breathtaking. Staff was very nice and accommodating. The food was good, I was just expecting better. So glad we went!",Good,Good,Good
"High above Lake Shore Drive next to Navy Pier on the 70th floor, Cit√© is a unique venue.  We chose the Chef's Tasting Menu.  We made an 8:30 reservation so we'd be able to see the Navy Pier fireworks at 9:30.  I had requested seating to see the fireworks on my reservation, but the table we had was not ideal.  They pleasantly offered to reseat us as another table had just come available and the fireworks view was terrific.  There was course after course of tastings -- plenty of food.  Since a scallop was one of the courses and I am allergic, I told the server and the chef sent out a delicious piece of salmon instead.  The lamb course was excellent and the asparagus arugula salad was also a favorite.  The caramelized pineapple with coconut sorbet for dessert was also delicious.  Service was perfect -- our server kept coming over to refill our wine glasses (we had ordered a bottle) and asking us how we liked each course.  The pace of the courses was also good -- not too fast, so that we had time to enjoy each course.  Great place to view the fireworks on Wednesdays or Saturdays in the summer or enjoy city views any time.",Good,Good,Good
"This was our first visit to Cite, and it did not disappoint.  I made our reservation a couple months in advance of our July 23rd anniversary, just in case they booked up for a Saturday night. Our 7pm reservation was perfect.  Our table had a fabulous view of both the city and lake front. The staff are very friendly and the service was excellent.  We even ended up talking about pets and swapping photos with our server, Yani (sp?), who is also a dog owner.  I highly recommend the bananas foster prepared table side!  We look forward to another meal at Cite the next time we visit Chicago.",Good,Good,Good
"This was my first visit to Cite and it was very pleasant. The views were spectacular, and the food good. We had the tasting menu which was very well put together, but the portion sizes were a bit too big. The service was fantastic!",Good,Good,Good
"Our favorite place to dine when we are in Chicago. Right on the lakefront, with a great view of the entire Chicago area. The food is always excellent, and the staff makes sure everything is outstanding. Extensive wine list, and the sommelier was able to make several suggestions based on my wife and my preference for different styles of wine. We regularly recommend Cite to friends visiting Chicago, and we always make time to go there when we are in town.",Good,Good,Good
"Another Chicago dining spot that you should visit only if you're okay paying a premium on ""ok"" food for a good view. Similar to other spots, not all tables are by the table. If you're not by a window, come prepared to ""time"" your pictures for when other tables leave or standing by the window. 


The food was contemporary French and was okay. Had the wagyu that I paid $80 for and was unsatisfied. 


Again, not a bad place but level your expectations and demand a window seat.",,,
"Cite is an awesome date night spot for couples. The atmosphere in Cite is calming and romantic. The views are absolutely spectacular! The service was great, from the minute we walked in the door to the time we left. Our food was amazing. I definitely recommend the crab souffle. I will say that it was a bit too much food. Next, time we will try the tasting menu. This place is pricey but worth it. We made reservations for 6:30pm one a Tuesday and it didn't start to get busy until closer to 7:30pm. We will most definitely be back!",Good,Good,Good
"High above the city on the top of Lake Point Towers is this revolving restaurant providing a 360 degree view of the beautiful Chicago skyline. The food is top quality with unique items on the menu. One is entertained by a top notch piano player.
The prices are steep but worth the experience .
I've been several times after going to Orchesta Hall and never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated. It is imperative to make reservations as far in advance as possible, especially during tourist season. You will not be disappointed with this choice.",Good,Good,
To say that tbis is a nice place to eat is a  understatement. It is one of the best in Chicago. The view from the top of the building is unbelievable. The ambience is warm and all class. The food was wonderful. The horduerves were terrific. I got the steak and lobster and my wife got a filet. Wow! With all of this wonderfulness comes the bill...hefty but it was worth it. We will go back for a special occasion but not a place that most normal people can afford to go to on a weekly basis.,Good,Good,
Business dinner on one of Chicago's best locations. On top of the Lake Point Tower you have an amazing view of the lake and of Chicago. I enjoyed the escargots and the Lobster tail which was excellent!.,Good,Good,
"This restaurant is on the 70th floor of a building down by the Navy Pier. It's a little bit out of the way but well eorth the effort.


The views of Chicago are incredible. The food is delicious. I had the surf and turf for my main and the steak was melt in the mouth.",Good,Good,
"As the building is located away from the rest of the Chicago skyline this is a great location to have a drink or meal to view the rest of Chicago. This is a very special restaurant with excellent food, great services and spectacular views.",Good,Good,Good
"I don't understand all the negative reviews. We had a groupon that's expiring yesterday so we went. Reservation is at 5 but traffic got us there at 530 even though we're traveling from Rosemont only.  It still took us 1 hr 35 mins! But no problem,  they accommodated us asap.


We had grilled octopus, lobster bisque, lobster, spinach, asparagus and dessert. They also give you free bread, butter and sorbet to clean your pallet. 


Everything was beyond our expectations. They were superb. We couldn't ask for anything more. We enjoyed every bit and lick of our food. Nothing disappointed us.


So to all of you who's complaining?  Maybe next time,  don't order chicken?",Good,Good,Good
"The service was very good, very attentive. I didn't care for the soups but otherwise the food was excellent. We were too full for dessert but I'd definitely go back.
The view was incredible - especially at night.",Good,Good,Good
"I forget - I think it's about 70-75 floors; but the view is really awesome.  Half your sight is the Skyline, the other half is the lake.  The vision at night is truly spectacular.  Really, there just aren't that many places with that kind of view.  The decor is elegant - nice, simple straight lines, very tasteful.  Speaking of taste, oh, yeah...the food.  Yes, I knew the place was noted because of the view, but Cite is definitely foodie worthy (the chef's tasting menu is special).  We can highly recommend especially if you've got a special occasion.",Good,Good,
"This place has an amazing view of Chicago best thing about Cite.  Second time her. Took my kids for 2015 Chicago Air-Show just for the view.  I had reservation well in advance and said I was coming to see the show. Was seating on the city side, where brunch was served.  I was the only one on that side. Sat 20 mins before I had to get a server to get me drinks. 15 mins later drinks came and we can't see any of the show. My kids go to get food and I'm
Not happy can't see anything so I tell the hostess I can't see and I had a reservation for the show. No
Other seats available. Why did I have a reservation.  Food was ok, not what I expect for Fine dining.  Serves a lot to be desired.  Finally the dinning mgr did come and move us to a great view but my overall experience was unpleasant and so not worth the money.  I contacted Cite with my concerns and the chose to write how the tried to resolve my experience but the bottom line I left unhappy and had a Bad. View is amazing lacks Service.",Good,Good,Bad
We came here and the views are stunning. It is a 360 degree view of the city which is amazing. The starters and sides were amazing- we had truffle risotto and lobster Mac and cheese. Our steaks were flavorful but had clearly been sitting for a while. There was a big lull in our service while I waited for a drink and during that time it was cler our steaks had waited as well.,Good,Good,Bad
"I took a friend to Cite for her birthday.  The view of the city is incomparable, the food is outstanding, the service gracious and you will not forget your time there.  While some may consider the prices steep, this is a special place for special occasions.  I have paid more for food that was not as good in places where there was no view.  We went early enough to witness the sunset stayed long enough to see the city twinkling below us in the dark.  My guest felt honored.  I felt blessed.",Good,Good,Good
"We went to Cite on our second night in Chicago.  It was on the 70th floor of a building and had an amazing view of the city.  We went on Venetian night and they had a prix fixe menu.  There was a flotilla of boats and fireworks that were viewed while we enjoyed each course of dinner.  The truffle mushroom risotto was so delicious & my husband enjoyed his shrimp with chipotle sauce appetizer.  I had lobster bisque which was perfectly cooked, and he enjoyed a beet salad.  We both had filet mignon... melt in your mouth tender.  For dessert we had the chocolate macchiato~ a sweet delicious end to a lovely evening.  It's pricey, but worth it.",Good,Good,
The is a top of the town restaurant with a 360 view of the city and the lake.  The food was very good and was prepared before our eyes with fresh ingredients.  Very rich pasta dish with any and all ingredients we chose.  Highly recommend for a late evening (get there before the Sun sets) early night dinner on a clear night.,Good,Good,
My husband brought me to Cite for my birthday dinner. He had called ahead and they had a menu printed with Happy Birthday across the top w/ my name. Our table also had rose petals across the top....both special touches that make all the difference!  The view is spectacular - I would suggest getting there before sunset so you can enjoy the view both before and after the sun goes down. The staff was super attentive - there when you need them but giving you plenty of alone time. They do not rush you thru dinner which is sometimes the case with this type of restaurant. The music that is piped in is not over whelming and the bar area is small so there can never be a big crowd to make a lot of noise.  The food was great. I am not sure why we waited so long to try this restaurant?? I know we will be back - I have nothing but good things to say!  Enjoy!,Good,Good,Good
"What a facility these folks have.  A view to die for in NY, Boston, London or France.  The price points really require all things, well exemplary.  It is not, and in some areas not good.  I do no think its fair to not be specific but please do not think I am merely piling on here, but this restaurant needs to be better.  Its location in the Lake Park Tower gives it a captive group of rich people who can come here not worrying about price at all.  Perhaps that is why thse folks fall short.  The good, the bad & the ugly:


Reservations were confirmed adequately, but by someone about 18 barely trained.  Two attire reminders, yet somewhat curious that several tables had jeans & tennis shoes.  Entering the elevator on 68 to 70 we were joined by a man with a cook's jacket who was cordial and carrying 2 pounds of sliced prosciutto ham.The beautiful elevator of North Point Towers opened and the framing just inside of the restaurant was scraped and dirty.  Three folks were looking at the computer screen and said hello, kinda begrudgingly.  We were seated.  Again it was kinda weird.  We had an early res & I told them we had to bail early to catch a train so there was a choice of any table.  Probably one of the poorer tables is near the ""squeeze""  spot where all personnel have to leave a larger room to enter a smaller room or get to the kitchens.  So as the Dining Room is filled, we are constantly brushed by people.  We left and the Dining room was only 1/3 to 1/2 seated, lots of tables.  


General facility:  Not maintained, lots of bumps and bruises, nicks and scratches.  OLD.  Bathroom just not fresh, and do I really want to actually touch a door knob?  How about a switch?  I really do not want to share the bathroom with staff, whether kitchen or dining personnel.  


Personnel:  Really relaxed to the point of almost lazy.  They know a certain amount of people and money is coming daily.  Not much urgency here.  Attire is atrocious.  The host stand had 3 folks with ill fitting clothes, too many yards of flesh and too few inches of clothes.  Large people CAN dress in a becoming way, these folks did not.  Waiters, bussers and supervisors had barely worn and barely pressed clothes.  They looked & behaved frumpily.  Hair not combed.  Men walking through the Dining Room hitching their belt  and tucking in their shirt.  Just not good.


Food:  almost adequate.  This place has a menu from a road house or country club circa 1975.  Oysters Rockefeller, seared scallop, venison.  Most was done OK, not well but OK.  But lobster stuffed ravioli?  again a throwback, but with a starched sauce not simmered.  Cheesecake...not really and not good.


All this place really needs is an operator.  Someone is not operating this place.  Employees have taken over and it has been reduced to the least acceptable model.  


I am SAD as it could be so much better.",Good,Good,Bad
"This is a great restaurant! You will often see it on groupon, so take advantage when you see it!  Great views and excellent service!",,Good,Good
"I was at the Cite first time, it was a very nice experience , place is open with rounded layout so everyone sits by the widows. Food is really good, and service was great. Valley parking is right by the building. I can definitely recommend this place to everyone.",Good,Good,Good
"I have to say they have the best view of the City.  Food was very good too, just came out way to FAST.  Not, sure if they are trying to be.  But, I think they are only 3 stars.
I had a App, Salad & Entree.  Everything was really well done, meaning very good.
Now when it comes to the place being clean and the servers polished.  They all need help.  If you worked on these things you could be a 4 star dining experience.


Servers need to me more attentive and less sloppy and I mean in the attire and service.
Would I go back?  Maybe!  But, if you cleaned your windows from the inside, clean the curtains and the silverware and serve wine without dropping it on the table and clean tables without plating everything in front of your guest and then dropping it.  You would make the A-list.
Work on these things and will could be great!",Good,Good,Bad
"Since I live in Arizona and my girlfriend  lives in Chicago, she wanted to do something special for me and took me to Cite on Saturday August 22nd. She had taken the time to plan a romantic night and reserved a table by the windows on the South East side so that we could watch the fire works from Navy Pier. When we got to the restaurant we were seated, but against the wall 2 rows away from the window. We did not think that was going to be a bad choice since no one was sitting at the tables between us. WE THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE ODD THEY DID NOT SEAT US AT THE WINDOW. Not one couple was seated at those tables all night. 


We proceeded to order two martinis and choose to get the Chefs taster menu, The Amuse -Bouche was a single slice of cucumber a little larger then a quarter with a drop of cocktail sauce and rock shrimp that was even smaller then  the slice.  I have had better attempts from students at cooking schools making a Amuse. 


Between all these courses we had to get new silver ware, since they only had a setting for 2 a course meal. I guess when we are paying over $300 for a dinner I expect a little better service. I  SHOULD NOT HAVE TO LIFT UP MY OWN PLATE TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE NEXT ONE AND HAND THE OLD ONE TO THE PERSON DELIVERING THE FOOD.  It Would be almost like asking me to bring my plates back to kitchen after I am done. 


We get our 4th Tasting which was "" ONE"" Seared Scallop. By the time the food was delivered my girlfriends drink was empty and there was no attempt to check on her until the dish was cold. We were finally able to order a glass of wine each and that was promptly delivered.  


I guess the most disappointing part of the evening was when the fireworks began, everyone that was not seated near the window or had seats on the other side of the restaurant ran to take the empty tables in front of us, BLOCKING THE ENTIRE VIEW. A few people needed to take selfies and standup so that we could not see the fireworks unless we stood and left our table.  Management made no attempt to ask these people to sit down. 


At the beginning of the evening my girlfriend had given the hostess our Groupon that was suppose to be applied to our bill. When we got the bill they forget to take it off and we had to wait for that to be corrected. After Taking off the $60 the bill was still over $200 and with the tip the bill was over $250. We paid  $89 a piece for a Chefs Tasting menu that was designed to make the most of serving us a LITTLE AS POSSIBLE.  This menu felt like it was designed with some one who lacked creativity.  I even wondered if of our dishes were even created in the kitchen or came out of a jar and or a package. 


If you are going to spend a nice  bit of hard earned money on what you are expecting to be a special dinner, you expect a little better service. From having to ask for clean silverware, moving my dishes to make room for the next tasting, to getting what tasted like stale butter with our bread, we both noticed that thing were a bit off. Some of the tables were folding banquet tables. Chairs were significantly scratched up to be noticeable. The one I sat it felt like it was missing the cushion.


Peter, our waiter was very nice to ask us if we were driving or taking a taxi. When we stated we took a taxi, he advised us  to tell the doorman  on the 1st floor and they can request a cab or turn on the cab light. Well when we got to the 1st floor and asked them to turn on the cab light, the men both seemed to chuckle and then one said we would not be able to get one due to the time of night and heavy traffic and it would be better if we walked up to Michigan Ave.and hail a cab. We walked outside and traffic was heavy and we tried to hail a cab in front of the building but ended up walking 3 blocks to get one. 
 
 IF IT IS YOUR 1st TIME TO CHICAGO and you want to experience something special try Girl and the Goat or Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder, They might not have the views, but you will be having great food, wonderful service and  you will be saving your self enough money you could visit several more restaurants. We Went to the Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder last night. The bill for 4 people, which included  a Italian Fiesta Salad 3 Pizza's and and Oven Grinder and 4 glasses of wine was a little over $100.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I brought a groupon for Cite thinking it would be a very special place to go with some friends. When I called to make a reservation on a Wednesday night because of the fireworks at Navy Pier I mentioned that it was going to be a celebration as my sister was recovering from a recent illness. It also turned out to be a birthday celebration for one of the people in our party of 5. About 15 minutes before we were leaving I got a call from Cite asking if my Sister was going to be coming to the restaurant, When I said she was they said they were preparing a surprise. When we got there there was a dozen red roses on the table. The whole evening was wonderful. The service, the food, was excellent. We had a great view as we had a window table. Everyone was very gracious. I would highly reccommend this restaurant and look forward to going back with friends from Chicago as well as when I have visitors.",Good,Good,Good
"My wife and I visited for our 30th wedding anniversary.  I had it planned weeks in advance.  I told the restaurant ahead of time.  They said ""Happy Anniversary"" when we arrived.  That's when things went downhill.  We were seated by the door about as far from the beautiful view as possible.  Seriously?  That was the whole point, the view.  We had a reservation and there was only 2 of us.  Very disappointing.  We would have waited if they asked if we wanted a window seat.  


Next our waiter was as monotone, unpleasant, and unfriendly as he could be, and even made a comment like ""saving room for desert?"" when we only ordered a main course.  I took it as a dig like we were cheap or something.  


Now the food was amazing.  I had the Sea Bass and it was up there with the best I've ever tasted.  Cooked perfectly.  My wife had the chicken and it was delicious.  They did bring us complimentary champagne and wish us a happy anniversary but again in the most unhappy voice possible.  


The other thing that bothered me was that the hostess, which I told ahead of time on the phone that I was using a Groupon, sort of embarrassed me in front of my wife by saying ""are you still using your Groupon?"" right in front of my wife.  And then when the bill came it was not applied and I had to get up and tell them.  


This was going to be a very special night and it turned out not so at all.  It was very disappointing for us.   We were only in Chicago for 3 days and the highlight was supposed to be this dinner.",Good,Bad,Bad
"The view in this restaurant is the best view you will have of Chicago. It's a 360 view (it doesn't move), so you can request a view to the navy pier, lake or city view south and north, but anywhere you sit, you will get an amazing view, perfect for a romantic dinner o any occasion.


One of the thing that I do like most is that the restaurant it is designed for the view, so no matter if you sit near the window or not, anyway you will get an amazing view.


Tip: Arrive early, parking may take a while, and it takes time to arrive to the restaurant due the security and elevators.


The food? Not good, my wife and I didn't like anything, I had an steak and she a duck something that we didn't like. The menu is not big, and mostly contains sea food, there is only 2-3 things other than sea food or steak. Tip: Check the menu before.


Price? The place is expensive, my steak cost around 50 dls and duck something around 40 dls; anyway you pay for the view.


TIP: The best time to go is around 7pm (during summer), at time you are able to view the sunset and",Bad,Good,
"Restaurant was a bit stuffy for my taste but the service and food were superb, albeit a limited, pricey menu.  It is located on the 70th floor of Lake Pointe Tower, a residential building located directly on Lake MI. You pay for the view!",Good,Bad,Good
"Well, as everyone else has said, it is ALL about the view here.  I went as part of a function, so I can't speak for the ""off the menu items,"" but the buffet they set up was exquisite!  The chefs really did a great job, and the staff was friendly and accommodating.....but the VIEW!  wow, totally worth it, I'll be back to try the menu.  Thanks!",Good,Good,Good
"Hi! It's Singlemamatravelista!


Here's my top three reasons why you should DEFINITELY take the time to enjoy the elegance and cuisine of  Cite!!


3. The Personal Service-  Cite was the surprise birthday dinner planned for my daughters 17th birthday.  When I called to make reservations, weeks in advance,  I felt so blessed and special. The hostess was wonderful in helping me book a time and experience that would be a lifetime memory for my daughter. She suggested to have dinner on Wednesday night so that we could see the fireworks and asked what my daughters fav foods were so that the chef may be able to have that something special on the menu that evening.My daughters favorite food is Lamb and sure enough, it was on the menu!  To add an even more special touch, they added a personalized birthday message to her menu.  The service during the dining experience was phenomenal as Melvin and his serving crew went out of their way to make our night special. 


2. Fantastic food presentation and flavor- Our Choices from the daily 5 course menu were:
Steak TarTare
Signature Greens
Amish Chicken
Lamb
Pomme Puree
Volcanic Purified Carbonated Water
Sprite


The food was absolutely delicious and plated to reflect elegant dining.  Select breads were served throughout the meal to compliment dining choices. The Chef offered a complimentary crab/seafood sample that my daughter is still raving over! ( She said it was so fresh and delicious, she thought they just went outside to the water, grabbed it up and prepared it.- I was not able to participate in this culinary delight because of certain seafood allergies) Every plated dish, even the palate cleanser emphasized attention to flavor and details that make your entree look and taste scrumptious. The food was so delicious in fact, that on the way out, we got a chance to meet the Chef and I immediately slapped him!!!!! :) ( Foodie lovers know the level of that compliment!!)


1. The atmosphere- Located on the 70th floor of the elegant Lake Point Tower, the views of Lake Michigan and the Chitown skyline leave you breathless.  The table settings align with the elegance of the view, boasting fine china and elegant linens.  The lighting is romantic, and personal, offering the perfect ambiance for secluded celebrations or romantic interludes. The fireworks from Navy Pier were brilliant as they lit the Sky and became the background for Cite's evening clientele.  It seemed the whole restaurant stood still as everyone gazed in awe at the Fireworks presentation from an explosive, eye level view.  Applause filled the restaurant as the fireworks finale filled the Chitown sky.  Cite strategically dimmed the lights and increased the light jazz playing softly in the background to increase the energy and excitement of the moment. 


The experience was worth its weight in gold!!!!!


singlemama tip: Cite often has Groupons that save up to $30.00 on your meal.  Also, portions are large and can be shared if you are not heavy eaters.


Quick note:  This is an elegant dining experience and business attire or better is the suggested style of dress.",Good,Good,Good
"Being atop the only high-rise on the lake side of Lakeshore Drive, the restaurant offers a great view of the Chicago skyline.  Arrive prior to sunset and watch the city come alive at night.",,Good,
We had 8 p.m. reservations and were seated promptly. I ordered an Urban Sidecar and my wife ordered a Sangria Margarita....both drinks were great! I had Chilean Sea Bass and my wife had Filet Mignon....really tasty. We had mac n cheese as a side and creme brulee for dessert....both were fantastic.  Nice view....great customer service (even with my Groupon lol!!!!!),Good,Good,Good
The view was awesome.  We took a bunch of pictures.  The food was very good the chef sent us some extra goodies to try.  we from Atlanta and we have the Sun Dial restaurant it spins.  This restaurant does not spin but has great panoramic views.  i recommend the lamb chops and the salmon.,Good,Good,
"After purchasing a Groupon to dine here, I began to read some of the negative reviews from people who had visited this establishment using one.  While I sincerely wish that one did not have to confess to having a dining coupon the moment they make a reservation at a restaurant, I can empathize with the waitstaff, who seem too often to get stiffed when it comes to their tips as a result.  Still, it seems wrong that those with any such offer should immediately risk the possibility of less than desirable seating, food, or service  when it is the choice of the establishment to make such an offer.  It would be much more fair to ask that we make mention of such offers before we ask for the check to be totaled.


I tried to ask Groupon why they had this rule the night before my reservation and received what sounded like a rather rude but formulaic reply from the ""chat"" person on line.  She made me feel that I was risking not being served at all if I did not call again and ensure that Cite knew of my Groupon, so I did.


Whether or not, Groupon got in touch with the restaurant themselves, I'll never know but I felt as though we not only got one of the very best tables available that night,
our service was stellar, and the food definitely met expectations for the price.  I would certainly recommend it, if you can afford it, even without a Groupon.",Good,Good,Good
"We had my mother's 65th birthday celebration family dinner here and we were very disappointed with the service, especially for a restaurant of this caliber.  The food was good, but the service made the experience awful.  First we were told they would bring out a glass of champagne on the house for my mother for her birthday.  This never happened.  Then 3 of us ordered the chef tasting menu which was very good.  However, the waiter offered to switch the venison that was on the menu to a filet mignon for all of us since none of us cared for the venison.  Well they still brought venison for all of us.  So they took it back and proceeded to take a good half hour or more to bring out the filet so the rest of the group was long done with their dinner by the time we got ours.  The timing of courses was also very slow!  Overall, we were at the restaurant for 4 1/2 hours!  Now we are all for taking our time and not being rushed for a fancy dinner like this, but come on, 4 1/2 hours!  And how convenient that the valet parking is only validated at $20 for 4 hours!  So, instead we all had to pay $40 for parking because they took so long.  Just the time from the intermission in the chef tasting menu to the main meal, we waited over an hour and barely could even get drink service during this time.  We also did not even get new silverware with each course.  At one point I had to take silverware off the table next to us.  We also had to send the bill back several times to be corrected.  We were being charged for items that we ordered, but never came to the table.  Overall we had a very terrible experience considering how expensive and fancy the restaurant was and we were very disappointed considering this was a very special occasion.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Steak was seasoned well but the cut of meat was much too fatty for the price of a steak. The lobster bisque and lobster macaroni were bland and did not compare to restaurants that have similar price points. Great bartender , this and the view are the highlights of an otherwise average restaurant.",Bad,Good,Good
"Only one couple was in when we got in for our 6pm reservation. We got seated immediately and after that no one came for about 15 minutes to take the order. Food was subpar and service was ridiculously horrible. Had a groupon and told the waiter named Will before I even ordered and the  waiter charged me for the full amount and said he had other tables so he forgot in a nasty manner. I told the manager to show me the credit to my account and he said Will threw them in the trash and he was too busy to talk. No one is even in this place so how busy can you be and that's not how you respond to a guest. The manager Walter said he was too busy to talk to us and kept pacing the floor doing nothing. Remind u that no one is in this place but about 2 tables by now. Then said he was going to call security on us and I asked why and never got a response. No reason. I began to chat wit the lady to the tBle next to us about the situation and he came and stood directly in front of me and talked to her so that I couldn't tell her about my experience. Utterly ridiculous. Started talking to another waiter and he did the same thing to get the waiter to not talk to us. I felt horrible, disrespected and discriminated against. I see why the other reviews are horrible as well.",Good,Bad,Bad
Loved the view.  Sat on the side with a view of Navy Pier and saw the fireworks that went off over the lake.  It was a very nice experience.  I felt that the food was average.  It definitely wasn't worth the price without the fireworks.,Bad,Good,
We went with our son and his girlfriend for his 30th birthday. The food was some of the best food I've ever eaten. Highly expensive.  Valet parking only. Cost $20 . We were there for sunset. Gorgeous to see over the lake,Good,Good,
"The worst service in my entire life!!! Ruuuude waiter richard came up to us at the end to said we did'nt leave enough tip, when he does not even how to do math!!! Our bill was $158 and We left 22 dls and he tought it was 12 dls., He said look your bill is 158 dls and you are leaving me 12??? I can report you so cant come iver again and when i told him to count it !!!! I left 180 dls so thats 22 tip, he said oh ok... And my question is where is my apologize from him??? I will neeeeever go back!!",,Bad,Bad
"My boyfriend and I enjoyed a table by the window that overlooked the bay.  It was gorgeous!  When it got dark, the city lights lit of the landscape.  PERFECTION!  The food was amazing.  We enjoyed the chef's tasting menu which was pricey, but well worth it.  It made for an interesting and adventurous meal and we enjoyed so much Good.",Good,Good,
"food was outstanding, lovely array of unusual side dishes, presentation superb, views were breathtaking.  Our only disappointment was that our immediate view was overlooking the roof and pipes area on the top of the building.  If you go, ask for a table where the roof is not directly below your table.  It is a pricy experience, but well worth the money.",Good,Good,
It is pricey. That is a given.  But it was a 60th birthday.  There is NO VIEW like it in all Chicago combining a view of the city and of the lake.  It is intimate without feeling small.  The staff is attentive without being too attentive.  Was disappointed my scallops were under cooked.  But I'm sure if I said something they would have corrected it.  By the time we descended from the 70th floor it was 11:30!  We NEVER stay out that late.  Was memorable and fun!,,Good,Good
"Our visit was flawed because we witnessed the man who, we believe, was supposed to take care of our table/area basically tell his floor manager he was too busy. This took place after we had sat, neglected, for a considerable period of time. The manager stepped in and did his best to take care of us but there was a definite negative vibe in the air. For instance, we received butter - but no bread. After they identify the waiter in question (9 PM reservation on 516/2015; you can figure it out) and discharge him, then work can begin on establishing a culture of Excellence to match the view!",,Good,Bad
"This was a very classy place to take a prospective client.  It is a top level restaurant, and should be reserved for the highest level client.  You have a great view of the lake, and it is all enclosed in glass.  If you are looking for a quiet, upscale place to take and impress your clients, this is a great one.",,Good,
"The views are fantastic!  The service on the night was poor, very poor.  
Not once did we get offered a drink, had to go to the bar every time.
The food, the scallops were fantastic, the soup was cold (well warmish), the fish was overdone, the steaks were great and the desert was great.
I think if you are going to offer a high profile restaurant and charge a high profile price you need to offer a high profile service and food.
They were short of staff (that is their problem) and there was a big group.
I would not go back.",Good,Good,Bad
"As the other review here note, go for the view.  The food is good but not great, but we usually find that ""view"" restaurants do not focus on the food quality.  Overall, food is OK, you're are paying a high price for the location.  Service is a bit pretentious.  Been there, done that, don't have to do it again.",Good,Good,Bad
"Had the filet, lobster mac n cheese, asparagus, and a few others we all shared. The steak was cooked to my liking and all 8 of us had no complaints on the food. The views are what you really should go for though. 70 floors up you have sweeping views of Chicago. Go before sunset and enjoy the city during daylight and then watch the lights come on as night overtakes day. We were told that Wednesdays and Saturdays were the time to reserve early as fireworks are set off those evenings. We sat at table #4 and loved it.",Good,Good,
"My husband took me to Cite on my birthday.  It was a perfect choice!  The one  thing that we kept commenting on was that we were actually able to talk thru the entire dinner. No loud piped in music - no crowd noise coming from around the bar area or surrounding tables. That alone made Cite a winner.  My husband had told them  ahead of time that it was my birthday. They had rose petals on our table as well as ""Happy Birthday Wendy"" on the top of the printed menus.  Very nice touch.  The service and food were both amazing. We were there early enough to catch the sunset....the skyline and lake views were great.  This was a refreshing change of pace - we will definitely be going back.  I forgot to mention they have my favorite dessert.....Banana's Foster - done table-side.  Perfect end to a perfect dinner!",Good,Good,Good
"HOW...HOW come this place is still open?! The only good thing about this place is the view, but that is it!.
First, the lobby downstairs smelled like a retirement home. I should have ran out then. Old elevator. When we reached the restaurant - the place was old, but not your New York luxury retro, but falling apart and needs carpet cleaning old! The last time is was manicured perhaps  ... never after opening! My glass wear was so dirty that even after they changed it I was now comfortable drinking from it. The food was cooked, delivered and decorated very poorly!  The sides looked simply gross. We didn't finish our meal just to leave this place and never come back! But how unfortunate! With good investment and management - this place could be a gold mine.",Bad,Bad,Good
"We did the chef's tasting menu for our anniversary dinner.  Food was wonderful, staff were very attentive, and the view was amazing!  I would recommend for a special romantic dinner.",Good,Good,Good
"I received a Groupon for this restaurant as a gift from my niece. Luckily it was clear night so the views to the city on the north, west and south were great. We received a table for two facing south east views. Great ambience. Service was prompt. Appetizer Ahi tuna was good so was the French onion soup. Good selection wine by the stem. Scallop entree was below par. Undercooked, chewy and bitter after taste. 4 pieces for $34 were pricey. Amish chicken was average. Valet parking at the building ($30) was full. Parked a couple of blocks away. They have discounted valet parking but it is not advertised on their website. I hope food improves. This can really bring some traffic to this place.",Good,Good,Good
"Cit√© is located on the 70th floor of a residential building at Navy Pier. The city views are absolutely amazing. The dress code states no jeans or tennis shoes on the website, but we saw many people dressed down. Some were even wearing sweat pants. The food was good, but for the price I expected a bit more.",Good,Good,
"We have been regular guests of this restaurant over the last 10-12 years. We always loved coming to Cite. This time was a very, very different experience. We asked with our reservation to have a nice view of the city and we were told, when they called to confirm our reservation, that it would be no problem. We showed up and were told they were too busy and would not be able to accommodate our request. We were told that we could walked around and take a look while others were dining by the windows which we would never disturb other guests while they are enjoining their dining experience.


Our meal was brought to us ice cold........wait.......and then never had our server come back to check on us........never. We had to ask our wonderful server's assistant to help us get our check. The assistants are marvelous! 


Unfortunately our experience this time has convinced us to look to other restaurants in the city that will take better care of their guests!,",Bad,Bad,
"This restaurant offers great views but more importantly, is an excellent place to dine.
All steaks perfect and personnel tops it.",Good,Good,Good
"Unless the view is more important than food quality, don't waste your time.  The food is average, the wine list middling at best.  Service is just ok.",,Good,
you. must. go!  The view!!!  While the food was okay who cares it's about the amazing view.  Ask to be seated against the window.  The restaurant is not large which makes the ambiance even more special.   We are no strangers to fine dining but this place felt quite exclusive.  The food was beautifully presented and the service was exceptional.  It is expensive so it's easy to be picky but I would say like others you are paying for the view.  We would go again for sure.,Good,Good,Good
"I ate at Cit√© with my 13 and 15 year old daughters and my mother. We all loved it!! It wasn't very crowded however our reservations were for 5:30. We had an amazing view and the food tasted very good. The only complaint is there could be a little bit more selection, it was mostly meats and salads with vegetables kids don't usually prefer. Overall this restaurant was a fabulous experience and I will definitely be back. 
P.S. we had a group on",Good,Good,
"The great: Breathtaking atmosphere, fantastic italian food, great wines. The tasting menu was put together very well, and the bananas foster was divine.


The not so great: Expect to pay over a hundred dollars a person. The hostess tried to put us in a seat with a not so great view.",Good,Good,Bad
"There is only one good reason to come to Cite, and that is the view.  It is spectacular, completely breathtaking.  You get a unique perspective when you are 70 stories above the city in the only building east of Lake Shore Drive.  Arrive well before sunset on a clear evening, so you can watch the sky transform from twilight into night.


The menu is dated, predictable, and overpriced.  Order a classic dish that you know you'll enjoy -- this is not really the place to experiment.  The wine list is very large, but we found our server (didn't see a sommelier) incapable of making an informed recommendation.  Desserts were also predictable and average, but you expected that, right?


You go to Cite for the view and everything that goes along with that.  If you expect more, you'll be disappointed.",,Good,Bad
"We went for my birthday celebration.  From the doorman to the hostess to the waitstaff, the service was inviting and professional.  They made you feel like a celebrity.  When you step off the elevator into the restaurant, the view takes your breath away.  I've never seen views like this in Chicago.  We ordered drinks, then appetizers, then entrees.  My husband had the six course chef's special which could be why we were there for a little over 3 hours.  The view helps with the wait time.  I had the beet salad (excellent) and the seafood risotto.  The risotto itself tasted very bland.  My husband had the venison with his six course dinner and it was excellent.  Tasted just like filet mignon.  The steak tartare, which my daughter had, was very good as well.  The chocolate fondue for dessert was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  I would say go for the view, stay for the view, but the food is really the side dish to the view.",Good,Good,Good
"I went with my wife for our anniversary. We had a spectacularly good time. The food, service and ambience were out of this world good. It was one of the best meals ever! I had read several reviews on this site that talked about Bad; so, I had some concerns. All our concerns were alleviated the moment we walked in the door. Everyone treated us like royalty. Our Captain Mark and our server Noe were great. Tim, the floor manager, stopped by several times to check on us. He was kind, funny and interesting and made our night even more special. The food was excellent. I had the tasting menu; each course was better than the next. One course was a scallop that was the best I have ever had. My wife enjoyed her meal as much as I did mine. This was a wonderful way to spend our anniversary.  We will go back; and, I highly recommend it to you.",Good,Good,Good
"I've paid more for food but this is the first time i felt like i got ripped off. The food is no way close to the quality suggested by their pricing. 


Yes the view is excellent. Yes the ambiance is excellent. But when it summary, it's a bad restaurant that charges five star prices for a good view. If you want good view with your special someone, just take the money and go rent a hotel room with good view. Pack a dinner and you will have good view with better food for the same price.",Bad,Good,
"The views from Cite are truly an amazing view.  It's a 360-degree view of the whole city, can't beat it! Food was great as well-- mushroom risotto, steak and dessert.",Good,Good,
"We went to Cite with a groupon and they treated us like gold. I made my reservation through Open Table and noted it was my birthday. They immediately recognized that and sat us at an awesome table. The view of the city and sunset was wonderful. We shared the steak tar tar and mixed greens salad and both were phenomenal! We had the seafood risotto and pork chop for dinner and shared a side of lobster Mac and cheese. The risotto and Mac and cheese were great! The pork was a little dry, but the taste was still good. We got a special chocolate mousse dessert for my birthday and that made it extra special. It was a fun experience with great service. Highly recommend it with the awesome view!",Good,Good,Good
from the food to the view I was totally in love!!!! Surf and Turf is a must and they let us sample some amazing sorbet!!,Good,Good,
"if you love food and have knowledge of food in general not just french , you will find the place average to poor , so try and stay with drinks more than food for a picture or 2 , if you dont care of food than you will certantly love the place .",,,
"Sept 10 had a business group dinner. Wow! What a great view from anywhere in the restaurant! But, you may say nice and what about the food? Rest assured the food is a good, ( or better), than the view. Arranged group dinner with help of private dining mgr Jessica. Wine list is extensive. Our group had an amazing experience. This is a great place for business dinners. I am looking forward to dinners with my wife. Servers were attentive to our groups needs. We will return!",Good,Good,Good
"Small restaurant on the top floor, 70th floor. A must for an evening meal to watch the sun set over the city and later watch the city lights. Great views all around. Staff very helpful. We had a set meal, and the steak was the best. Bit like Hogs Breath as the steak is roasted over hours. Meal over all was ok, service good. But a must for the view of Chicago.",Good,Good,Good
"We've dined at cite before and it was very nice.  We had a party room and went with a large group!  This time however it was just my husband and myself.
We had a groupon and because of that, we feel like we got treated as though we were not going to be very good customers.  As we walked in, the view of the city skyline was amazing, however? We were led to the back of the resturant with no view if the city, just a view if lake michegan, which was dark and dreary looking.
We believe with one hundred percent certainty that it was because of the Groupon that we got placed there. The waiter brought our dinner menus and asked us if we would like a drink menu, and we said yes we would like a drink menu well it was probably about 15 minutes before we even received the drink menu. Again we think it was because of the Groupon. The service after that did get better but the food portions for the price were very very small my husband ordered the scallops and they were for medium-size ones if that. Overall the experience was not that great for the price it should've been a heck of a lot better",,Bad,
"Sure, you can go to the 95th floor of the Hancock, or the Metropolitan Club in Willis Tower, but my favorite restaurant skyline view comes from Lake Point tower at Cite enjoying some delicious French culinary expertise.  
Besides enjoying the sweeping views of our beautiful city, Cite offers delicious French food.  I've been here on multiple occasions, but this review will focus on my experience last night.
After honeymooning in French Polynesia, my wife and I were still in the mood for delicious French cuisine.  We found a Groupon for Cite and purchased it.  Not only did we have great food, but we got a little discount along with it.  
We enjoyed the chef's tasting menu.  It was nice to have some smaller portions outlining a variety of different French food.  We did not have escargot this time, but that is usually a favorite of ours.  Brian, our waiter, was very talkative and gave us excellent service, and noted that we were trying to keep our honeymoon going, so he got a couple glasses of champagne to keep the celebration going.  It was a great night!  We definitely left full despite the smaller plates (there were many!).  My suggestion, do not fill up on bread (super obvious, I know).",Good,Good,Good
"We booked Cite for Easter brunch, and were not disappointed.  We enjoyed a birds-eye view of the city, which was great for our two teenagers who had never been to Chicago.  The brunch was fabulous, with great variety, elegantly prepared.  Only complaint, which really can't be helped, is that the dimensions of the restaurant made passage through the buffet tables and dining tables a bit tricky.  I would recommend for a special occasion.",Good,Good,
"Friends who had been here a few times invited us to join them at Cite'.  Having lived here for many many years, being foodies and not having heard of it - we were all in for he ride.  What a ride it was!  It started with the sleeping valet parker at 7:15pm.  Then came the stench of dirty carpets and fabrics when we walked in.  Our dining partners had brought a wonderful bottle of expensive wine.  We had drinks and a perfectly acceptable amuse bouche (though the server told us it was foie gras but I'm pretty sure the kitchen only saw geese out the window).  Our friends asked to have the bottle opened.  Jeremy advised us that he wouldn't open the wine since they sold the same bottle for $175 and if we wanted it we'd have to buy it from them.  Our host advised him the at Silver Oak they were selling was years more recent than the one he brought and since the restaurant advertises corkage he wanted the one he brought opened.  Jeremy refused to open it.  Our host asked for the manager.  Jeremy told us he was the manager and wouldn't open the bottle. Dinner proceeded (with no bottle of wine) and was average and for its price - way below average.  We left Jeremy a $0.00 tip on $325 of dinner with no wine.  Second time I've done that in my life.  As we were walking out with Jeremy following behind us making statements to himself (we hope), our host asked the gentleman standing there who was the manager and found that he was the manager and not Jeremy.   OOOOPS!  Big mistake Jeremy.   The manager - equal to the class of the establishment did not offer any remedy other than when we come in next time to ask for him (if he's still there and if we could possibly come up with an insane reason to go there again).  Needless to say, we hope the entire team gets new jobs and the ownership either gives up or wakes up.  Please make way for a good operator in this lovely location.  Oh - I forgot - when we got to parking to get our car, the attendant asked for our validation for discounted parking.  No one even asked upstairs at the restaurant if we wanted car validation.  A continuing example of the experience.",,Bad,Bad
"No matter how good the food is, if it is served to you with hostility, you will not relish it. 


The stewards were in a mad rush at 8:30 pm, pushing aggressively for orders, refusing requests and then offering to accept athose same requests as a ""special favor"" (a.k.a. You bloody well Tip me well) , even the hostess at the entrance was making a quick buck offering to stamp parking endorsements against a ""cash only, no receipt"" payment of $12. 


Toilet was dirty with no one cleaning it thru the 2 hours that we were there. 


The residences underneath are under renovation and you feel like u're getting into a shack (not within the restaurant's control to be fair).


If the view is what thrills you, go to willis/JH towers - u'll get a better bang for your buck.


All in all, the restaurant leaves u feeling ripped off at the hands of a bunch of stewards whose manager is least interested/ missing in action.",Good,Bad,Bad
"From the moment we walked in we were greeted with warmth and a helpful host that whisked us off to our beautiful table with a gorgeous city and lake view. Our captain was extremely helpful in picking out menu items that suited our taste and in keeping with the birthday celebration. The Escargot for it being our first time trying it was delectable, crab souffle light and fluffy and full of crab. We were given complementary champagne and a dessert  and our drinks were perfect.  All in all it was a pleasurable dining experience, one which I would recommend to anyone.  If you're using a Groupon make sure you settle all the fine prints before the end of the meal so you're not left having an issue with payment.",Good,Good,Good
"Found out about this place from Groupon. Since we are a party of > 4, we were able to use 2 vouchers! We didn't have any hard time using it. Staffs are very nice and accommodating. We got the  chef's tasting menu and we loved it! Perfect place for couples! Ambience is so romantic plus you get to enjoy viewing the heart of Chicago! There's no bad seat, you get good view everywhere! Giving it only 4stars due to its very expensive food prices... You're also paying for the view.",Good,Good,Good
"I have lived in Chicago for many years and had never eaten at Cite on the grounds that the higher up the food is served (think airplanes), the less likely it is to be tasty.  But my wife and I  were at Navy Pier for the Garden Show and decided to give it a try despite the many $$$$ signs on opentable, tripadvisor, etc.  


The food was a pleasant surprise.  All of it was excellent, especially the filet.  However service was, well... pretty off.  I ordered a glass of sparkling wine by name and location.  I was brought some sort of vile liquid that looked, smelled and tasted awful. Apparently the waiter had not heard me and brought something else, which should, in any event, never have been served to any living creature.   My wife asked why the only Riesling by the glass was $29. The waiter said he didn't know and that they had another one of unknown price that was ""less."" There were a couple of other minor missteps on service. 


The building on which the restaurant sits atop is under major interior renovation.  When you get of the elevator to transfer on the 68th floor, it was quite literally a construction zone with the walls stripped to the studs and a concrete floor.  I know the restaurant can't help this, but... yikes.


So all in all an uneven experience.",Good,Bad,Bad
"I made the mistake of informing the person I made the phone reservation with that I would be using the Groupon. (In my defense, I have had an experience where I did not inform them upon making a reservation and it caused a problem when the bill came around.) I also let her know that I would be celebrating my anniversary. I was so blown away by the view when we first got off the elevator on the 70th floor, but that quickly fizzled as we were taken half way around the restaurant where the view was minimal for me and nonexistent for my boyfriend. We were seated right beside the kitchen entrance and I immediately regretted telling them I had a Groupon before hand.


Things started to turn around. We were brought complimentary glasses of champagne for our anniversary. We shared the Petite Steak Diane for our appetizer and paid $17 to have two bites each. My boyfriend had the duo of lamb which was delicious. I ordered the filet mignon and asked for it to be prepared medium but the outside was very overdone. I had the lobster mac n cheese as my side, it was tasty but not very cheesy, more like garlic butter. My boyfriend had the potato au gratin which was mediocre. We opted not to have dessert. With two glasses of wine our bill before the Groupon discount was $170. I would have been far more impressed had we been given a more romantic table given that I had specified the occasion of our visit. 


As other people have stated, you pay for the view. We weren't upset with our visit, it helps to be in the company of the one you love, but do not tell them that you have a Groupon before your bill comes.",Good,,
"Nobody likes getting gouged on a holiday, or any other day, but for triple the price, it better be perfect.  We had an earlier reservation so we didn't expect to be told they had run out of something on the prix fixe menu, but sure enough, they were out of the Moet. The waiter graciously offered to upgrade us to the Perriet for the same price. Fine we said. It arrives warm. Wow. Was this their first Valentine's day?  So we waited about 20 minutes for the champagne to chill.  The service was attentive, but not what you would expect from a restaurant that charges 5 star prices on non-holidays. The food was adequate,  but again,  not 5 star.  Throw in the automatic 20% gratuity (thanks for making that decision FOR me), $30 for parking, and I'm out $500 for a $200 meal.  The view is spectacular,  but for the $300 I wasted I'd recommend a trip to Miami instead.",,Good,
"High prices high above Lake Shore Drive.  Excellent Steak Tartare starter and duo of lamb main (the the lamb jus is intense!)  Sides are huge, so order accordingly.  You might find it difficult to carry on a conversation....the views of the Lake, the harbor, the skyline, and the park are intensely lovely.  This historic skyscraper was built long ago after the area's shipping industry declined.  Now, it's a nice walk along the river from the hotels east of Michigan Avenue (and just a few steps from Navy Pier.  From the city center, take the free shuttle along Illinois avenue.",Good,Good,
A long time ago I came here somewhere back in 2008 and the food was good but I mainly went because I got a groupon. I again got a groupon this time coming back and the views from here are unmatched. I just happened to come right as the sun was going down and got a breathtaking view. I sat up at the Bar and Amire was the bartenders name* cant be sure if I spelled it right*. He took very good care of me at the  bar and made some great recommendations. He was polite and very curteous. I had the duck and a tomato salad which were both very good. While I was there I saw people ordering the chefs plate which consisted of 10 different dishes and after the meal I kind of wished I had got that. All in all a great place to eat with some great views and service.,Good,Good,Good
"Food really NOT good . Like others, I find it really disappointing that this amazing location is being ""wasted"" on a mediocre place. Most disappointing was the Tuna steak - it was nice decorated but raw inside .Obviously the views here are unmatched. This is definitely a nice one-time ""Chicago experience"" to have if you're in the area, but I unfortunately can't see myself ever repeating it.",Bad,Good,
"food is only average, at best.  Most dishes (we're a group of 8 people, so we tried a fair bit of the menu) came out to be too salty.  Most disappointing was the Wagyu steak - the steak was of very good quality, but the saltiness ruined it.",Bad,,
"We were celebrating my partners 60th bday he choose Cite, great choice and the price was very reasonable for a 5 course meal with parings!! Our captain(my apologies for butchering your name) Oince was pleasant, menu helpful and funny, he also accommodated us for our cheesy photo op, the music was approiate and a nice volume .The busser and food server were very pleasant as well
My dislikes: hostess was not very personable,or professional in appearance, she looked like she was going clubbing,her hair should be neatly pulled back then she wouldn't be so tempted to play with it as she is seating guests. Also the GM nor the chef made table visits
 
Some of reviews complain about the decor if you and/or you dinner companion are interesting or having interesting conversation who cares about the decor,sometimes living in America we become to needy and eager to complain.


Ohh I just found a groupon for guess where!? yes Cite so we will be back!!!",Good,Good,Good
"Beautiful view. Weird entrance, two elevators, no one in the lobby helping with directions. Service was OK. Food really NOT good even if it had been a third the price. We knew in advance we were there for the view and not the food, and therefore ordered simple meals (not that anything is all that elaborate). But really really could work harder on the food. The salmon tuna tartare was pretty good.",Bad,Good,
"If you are visiting Chicago, the view is worth it if you get apps and drinks - the menu prices are too high for the quality of the food, so I wouldn't recommend dinner, and the service was poor.  I mean, really bad.  In fact, I never got one of the side items I ordered.  I found the waiter too condescending and rude for such an ""upscale"" eatery.",Bad,Good,Bad
We went to Cite's for snacks/appetitier I had the Escargots and Lobster Bisque I truly enjoyed the Escargot but not the little puff pastries on top but loved the reg bread brought to the table used it to soak up the butter sauce and in the Bisque my friend had a glass of wine and salad it was a beautiful resturant service very good but it is to expensive to go but a wonderful place to go for special occasion because of the view beautiful resturant service and food,Good,Good,Good
"From the time you get off the elevator the mood is set. just beautiful. The views are amazing and the food.... oh The food was amazing. ....
Drinks...the GiGi was nice. Sweet but with a kick. We ordered the seafood risotto and shared it a a appetizer. The scallops were the best I have ever had!!!
Main course we ordered the surf and turf. The filet was cooked perfect !!! 


We passed on dessert , we were stuffed. 


Definitely making plans to come back !!",Good,Good,
"Located on the 70th floor of the Lake Point Tower by Navy Pier, the view and location are by far the highlights of the experience at Cit√©.  The view of the city of Chicago or Lake Michigan (depending on which side you sit) is breathtaking. The menu is by no means poor, but the fare isn't worth the price.  


My wife and I went out to dinner before a show one particular evening.  I was excited to try Cit√© since I had never been before.  The menu options are pretty standard, there are no real surprises.  There are the standard cuts of beef, I ordered the grilled salmon, my wife ordered a couple of appetizers.  The food was good, but as I said nothing blew me away.  We did order dessert which was actually the most disappointing part of the experience.  The cr√®me br√ªl√©e  was not very good.


All in all, I felt Cit√© was a pretty average experience.  The food was good but not great, overpriced for most dishes, but the decor and view was incredible.  It's a place worth checking out but now that I've been I will probably not make a return visit.",Good,Good,
It is high up and overlooks Chicago. You can even see the Ferris Wheel spinning. The service is good quality and the food is excellent.  It is cooked perfectly. The menu  has a nice variety of foods. Its an excellent choice for an elegant night out with someone special.,Good,Good,Good
"What a Bad. My husband made reservation a week in advance and requested table next to the window, since 70th floor in Chicago will make a good view. When we got there we did not get the table next to the window, even though a few tables next to the window were empty. We knew that this dinner will cost around $200-300 so decided to enjoy our company at the table we got sited. 1 hour and 15 mn after still no food on the table, and I mean nothing, not even an appetizer. When the waiter came to ask how was everything we said everything we had to say about bad customer service for such establishment. The staff looks like came from the fast food places. The waiter did not described the food nor stopped by after the food was served (1 hour and 45 minutes after we got there). It was a really Bad.",,Bad,Bad
"Having read some of the reviews, I was afraid I was in for some big ripoff, but I found the experience most enjoyable. Yes, it is expensive: Just accept that, and try to manage your costs if that is a concern. I had a Groupon, which would basically pay for the tip. We got there before 7 on a Friday, and they seated us at one of the best two-tops for view: by the bar, looking straight west over the city and north over the Drive. I don't think it hurts to dress decently; I wore jacket and tie.
The waiter, in an actual suit, was quite professional. I was getting the tasting menu, and he was quite nice about guiding my wife to just get the entree and splitting some of the things from my order rather than ""upsell"" her to order sides like many steakhouse menus do (this menu is steakhouse-style, meaning a la carte; whoever invented the steakhouse menu, which charges you more than normal for the entree and then makes you pay for the side, was a genius!) Only downside to the tasting menu is that entree is only either filet or sea bass. My filet was quite good--not bland as can be the case, and rather large. Wife's tuna was quite good too--rather feathery with a nice crust. Service was good throughout. I'd have to say I was pleased with what I got for what was a pretty big price tag for my humble budget.


Yes, the place is a bit dated, the side facing the lake looks a bit worn, and of course at night, except for Navy Pier, the view is a black lake.


I guess parking is expensive, but we were over in River North, and took the CTA bus for 2 bucks, which gets you there in no time and gets you home too.",Good,Good,Good
"This dramatic view of the city is matched by the high caliber service and fine food. We enjoyed the fixed menu, but heard from others the standard menu items were also excellent. The wines offered were also an great complement to the occasion.",Good,Good,
"If I had only thought that when I went to Cite i may not have been as disappointed. Poor service and rather ""meh"" food we more of the experience we got. I went on a Saturday evening with my daughter and her boyfriend. we really didn't feel like having a bottle of wine and was pleased that they had a nice selection of wine by the glass. 
For starters we had Lobster Bisque, Caesar Salad and Steak Tartar. All three tasted very nice and were well presented. 
I was a bit confused by the Prime rib on the menu which isn't prime rib at all. It was a tough blackened rib eye that was not the greatest. Unfortunately we ordered two of them.and although we ordered med rare and rare, they were both over done. Normally we would have sent back the steaks and asked for a re-make, but up to this point the service had been sketchy and we weren't very confident that we would have been successful. We also had an order of the seafood risotto and that was prepared very well. 
Overall, the food was good, not great. However the service was well below our expectations for such fine dining establishment. The table was set for silver service but the waiter must have just come from Dennys. He was kind but unfortunately not very attentive.Water glasses stayed empty far too long and we were never checked on after our courses arrived. Probably another reason we didn't send back the overcooked steaks.
the view from atop the Lakepoint Towers is very special. the night was clear and we could see across the lake for many miles in all directions.",Bad,Good,Bad
"Dear readers,
I live in Chicago since 5 years and i went to at least 200 different restaurants, at least. despite the location which is nice, you will hardly find another place where you eat so badly, where the service is so unpleasant and when the price is so incredibly high. how is it possible that this place is still open??? You guys don't need to place millions of coupons to attract people, we don't care about discount, it's not all about that! you have to change management immediately, nobody like it and cooker too; you need to start provide good quality at a reasonable price, put some music to entertain people, be less formal because that style is no longer what most of the people are looking for; make a big change and you will see how you will start to get good review, make money; if instead you keep doing that, you better change business.
Take care",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Have a drink at the bar, enjoy the wonderful views of Chicago, and go elsewhere to dine.  


The service is worse than you would find at a greasy spoon in the neighborhood.  We were there with our grandchildren - and their parents - and the wait for appetizers was extraordinarily long and when the appetizers arrived, the wait person brought a salad we did not order, and forgot the escargot for our grandson. After another long wait, the escargot arrived, but not the steak tartare for our son in law.  When asked why there was such confusion our waiter went into a long explanation - but not in English.


The filet was very good, the risotto my wife had was a gloppy, soupy mess, and the scallops were just ok. 


It is not an inexpensive place, and when you add $28.00 to park your car below, it adds insult.


As someone else remarked, it is a relic of the past, but not the 90s, more like the 50s.  Needs serious work on the decor and the service, to say nothing of the food.",Good,Good,Bad
"A time warp restaurant. It is like you went back to the 1980s and this was the cats meow then ...things have changed and this place did not. This restaurant could be the next Carnelian Room with some real vision and some serious cash!


Inspired: nothing and no one


Pro: view is good only if your table is next to the glass, it does not spin


Con: entire staff, value, smell in lobby, lumpy chairs, not updated anything


Return: for a drink...years from now


Purchased: via Groupon",,Good,Bad
The view is beautiful but the service and food were mediocre.  This was my first and last time eating here.,Bad,Good,Bad
"The view from this restaurant is awesome (I love, love Chicago) This was my choice to celebrate my Christmas birthday.  The twinkling lights of the city and beautiful views of Lake Michigan are beyond compare.   I wish the food was as good as the view.  The menu is limited, the presentation mediocre, and the tastiness of the food was disappointing.  The chocolate martinis were delicious.  I enjoyed the view, but will not return for food that was only fair.",Bad,Good,
Did a groupon on New Years Eve and the bill was $275 without alcohol. Everything was ok but not special.  We were seated near the bathroom so our view was less than spectacular. The view from the small bar area was much better and I wish we had been seated there.  Service was good but I don't see us hurrying back. I agree with other reviewers that this place could use a facelift.,,,Good
"Great View, Awesome Chef Tasting!!!!   I was here the weekend before X-Mas with my Travelzoo or Groupon which came in handy since I travel alone.   I had the Chef's Tasting which was amazing and had great conversations with the Bar Staff and the Servers when they were at the Bar picking up their drinks.  I will definitely return again in the Spring/Summer to see the Fireworks.",Good,Good,Good
"I've never ever paid this much for service as incompetent and disjointed as this. First, after calling the day before to confirm our reservation when we arrived they couldn't find it. Unfortunately things went down hill from there. As we waited for our guests we ordered wine. Wine was brought, I tasted it, my glass was filled then the waiter took the bottle and left, leaving my three colleagues standing around wondering. Dinner was ok, nothing stood out, other than once again desert and coffee was a bit like the keystone cops. One of my colleagues ordered a cup of green tea. There was green tea, then there wasn't? How about Earl Grey, sure, done. He was then asked four times over the next ten minutes if he wanted coffee, he repeated four times that he was waiting for tea. The fourth time, he commented "" no, for the fourth time, I'm waiting for tea"". The waiter retorted angrily, ""you didn't tell me four times, you told him, he's slow"" (pointing to another waiter)
We left laughing about the experience. Not a great place to go if your intent is to impress clients.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had company coming to Chicago and a Cite was a perfect decision.  70th floor.  Fantastic views. Broad choices on the menu.  Salmon, pork chops, duck, chicken, scallops...Sides to share.  We got the chocolate fondue to share- a bit messy for such a fancy restaurant. No jeans or sneakers. Dress up!  You won't be overdressed at all.",Good,Good,
"I have now been to Cite twice, both because of Groupon. You can easily spend $100 a person with 1-2 drinks and a full meal. The view CAN be great. The first time we watched the sun go down over the city. The second time we arrived when it was already dark and had a view of the lake. It was like looking into endless black.


If money is not a concern, it is worth to check it out at least once. The food is decent, but I have had similar quality in Chicago for half the cost at many places.
The service is strange. The wait staff try to be nice, but its like they don't know what they are doing some times, or they engage in awkward conversation. Its not a ""fine dinning"" experience I have had at many other places.


And the place is in need of a gut rehab. Once the sun goes down it looks better, but it is out dated. The springs in my chair had blown out the bottom and it was like sitting on a box with no support in the middle.


Go once, but don't go for the food. You can get better food or much cheaper food all around Chicago near the ground at a much better value.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The food is decent but the view is spectacular. Cite is very small but every table is up against the window with beautiful views of the entire city. The ""chefs selection"" menu is a good way to go at $78 per person.",Good,Good,
"Great view with the sense of a very private experience when taking an exclusive elevator to 70 th floor. Food was very good and service plus. But again, what a view !",Good,Good,Good
"We went to la Cit√© 6 years ago and did not remember well how the food was. We went back last winter. The view of the restaurant is still like in our memories, WONDERFUL. 


When we arrived, at our big surprise, 3 hotesses were waiting at the entrance in mini skirt, which were really not appropriate for the restaurant of this category. THe waiter was extremely rude and pushing for us t take the order asap. We finally ordered, i took some snails and my wife some gnocchi. My wife really enjoyed her gnocchi but i really did not think the same about my snails. then i had some leek with 3 sea scallops. Bearly 1 leek. I dont mind paying a certain price if my food worth it in term of originality. The food i had in my plate i could have done it myself for less than 10 USD with few sea scallops more, however i paid 35 USD for this dish. My wife had a rissotto with 2 shrimps and 2 sea scallops, which did not taste good. wine was not extraordinary and too expensive for the category. During the meal, few teenagers started to use the piano in the restaurant and played. After 5 minutes i had to complain for the guy to go talk to the teens. Finally, as the meal was a huge disappointement at 220 dollars, i did not leave a tip to the waiter who ran after me when we were leaving asking me the reason we did not give him anything. Will never go back again",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I know you go to these places for the view. I guess I was expecting too much. There was a dress code so I knew it was upscale, so I was expecting upscale service and food. First of all the views great but the decor in the place is terrible, very outdated design, actually terrible. The chairs were those cheap ones u but from target. I felt very 90s in there. Service was terrible because the waiter we had much have had an regular there. He payed way more attention to these other old couple. It was very noticeable. I go out to eat all the time in Chicago. Usually upscale restaurants have great service. This place was terrible. Please remodel the inside at least get rid of the carpet and treat your customers equally. This place would do so much better if these changed. Great view terrible everything else.  Check groupon it's been there for couple if days and its only at 600sold any others place would've sold out by now.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"In a group or small party, Cite was quite an experience.  We found the food excellent and the waitstaff focused on service.  The views out to the Navy Pier and back to the Loop were wonderful.",Good,Good,Good
"Our first time in Chicago, and looking forward to dining at Cite, but we were totally disappointed! The view is pretty, but the food was terrible and the service was not much better. My husband order the lamb chop medium and it came out raw! The lobster bisque was probably the worst I have ever had! It was expensive and just not worth the price at all! We will never go back! The one star was for the view!",Bad,Good,Bad
"We were celebrating our Wedding Anniversary and we requested a table by the window with city view. It's exactely what we got! We arrived at 8:00 pm, perpect timing for a beautiful sunset. They gave us Champagne on the house, knowing it's a special day for us. Then an ""amuse"" sent by the Chef: fig wrapped bacon. The softness of the fig with the crunchiness of the bacon was devine. I tried the Lobster and my husband had the Wagyu, both delicious! We received an intermezzo (sorbet) before dessert, heavenly! The dessert came with a candle, very thoughtful of them. After dessert they treated us with Dark Chocolate and Berries. The view is to die for, especially at sunset. Thank you to Utsie and to the entire friendly staff for a wonderful experience and great pictures (they took many pictures of us)! Highly recommend.",Good,Good,Good
"A very good, not inexpensive restaurant.  Very romantic, with the views of the lake and Navy Pier.  Park below in LakePoint Tower parking and be sure to tell them you're dining at Cite.",Good,Good,
"Cite is located on the 70th floor of Lake Point Tower overlooking Chicago  We were lucky enough to be seated at the window with a view of the city.  A special thanks to Amir for exceptional service and conversation!  He really made our night very special.


We ordered the Chef's tasting for the night - I had the Sea Bass and my husband had Veal Chop.  Every course was excellent.  The food was beautifully prepared and presented.  The Lobster Bisque was the best that we have had.  Atmosphere provided for a very nice dinner with exquisite view - we culdn't have asked for more.


Again, thank you Amir for being so wonderful and helping us make wonderful memories!",Good,Good,Good
"We went to this beautiful restaurant -360 view of Lake Michigan and Chicago- with a group which had booked the whole place. We arrived at 7:30 for cocktails and finally got our entre√© at 10:15. Many of our group left before dessert. Food was good, but everyone was anxious and hungry and the organizers were embarrassed.


Advice: Go without a group and enjoy the view.",Good,Good,
"We went 4th of july weekend so the view of fireworks were awesome.  they also bring out a few extra dishes to sample.  soup, sorbet(to clean your palet) and for us champagne.  service was extraordinary .  i think some of the reviews on here are maybe by very hard to please people.  our food was cooked to perfection and the hostesses were great with seating us fast and a spot we would really enjoy.  the chairs were very comfortable.  the drinks a little pricey but for 230$  it was well worth the $$$$. I liked this place far better than signature room, which is usually our place of choice.  also  they do take a while to get to you if they notice you are still looking over the menu.  as long as you are decided and put the menu aside then they come over immediately.  I've worked at numerous restaurants and I can say this was very high-end food and our waiter was the best of the best.  the only problem was finding parking on july 4th weekend.",Good,Good,Good
"Cite' was the venue of choice for our recent wedding ceremony and reception.  We were delighted with all aspects of the event -- exceptional quality/presentation of dinner selections, extraordinary service, outstanding attentiveness of staff, and a breathtakingly beautiful view of the city!


We were truly impressed with the warmth and professionalism of our event planner, Tania Yalda.  She anticipated every need during the planning process, and was on site during the event to guarantee a lovely and memorable occasion.


We love Cite'!!!",Good,Good,Good
"The title says it all ....... Wonderful View, but the food was a little disappointing; especially when you consider the prices.  The prices lean toward the expensive; so I guess the amazing view comes with a price.  I would suggest a drink and an appetizer.  However, maybe I was there on an off night.",Bad,Good,
"Amazing view.  Best thing about this place.


Not worth the price, for sure. Hoped for culinary brilliance, got average to Good.


No parking.  


Worst of all, subpar service.  Waiter barely spoke English.  Sniffed our drinks and made weird comments.


Would not tell my friends to go back.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"One star for the service - good; one star for the view - great; However, the food is really bad. We went there for Mother's day brunch - not much you could really eat. Most food are not fresh and they are tasteless. If you want to go there to have a good view, go for it; but do not bet on the food.",Bad,Good,Good
"During the NATO weekend in Chicago we visited Cite.  The location, next to Navy Pier, on the 70th floor offers fantastic skyline views.  The set up is circular so that you can have a 360 degree vista if you walk around.
Upon arrival the air conditioning unit was not functioning and the atmosphere was sultry.  We were located close to a spot cooler that took off the edge but did not reach comfort level.
During our stay a NATO delegation came in, complete with body guards.
Our waiter was excellent.  The seafood was exquisite.
The menu is ala carte and the prices add up quickly.  Cite is a tourist destination that charges for the great views.",Good,Good,Good
Enjoyed an evening out for dinner.  Despite some of the negative food reviews I was very happy with my meal and so was my wife.  The view was terrific.  My main complaint was it was extremely warm and the AC did not seem to work well at all.  It wasn't that hot an evening but with the sun and all the windows it was brutal.  We left without having dessert because it was so warm.  I asked the hostest on the way out and she just shrugged her shoulders saying it was an old building.  Would go again but maybe at a cooler time of year which is why I gave it an average rating.,Good,Good,Bad
"Food's OK, but priced about at the same altitude as the dining room with the  wine prices stratospheric.   Service seems sincere enough, but they don't perform.  No reason to go other than the view.  Seems everyone else seems to know that already.  Easy to get a reservation and you'll know why if you go.",Bad,Good,Bad
"I went to a party here and all I have to say about it is that has a GREAT VIEW (my review is only on the bar lounge). Imagine how amazing is look the city from the 70th floor?!
The place itself is beautiful and classy.
Jeans are not allowed.",,Good,
"We went to la Cit√© 6 years ago and did  not remember well how the food was. We went back last winter. The view of the restaurant is still like in our memories, WONDERFUL. 


When we arrived, at our big surprise, 3 hotesses were waiting at the entrance in mini skirt, which were really not appropriate for the restaurant of this category. THe waiter was extremely rude and pushing for us t take the order asap. We finally ordered, i took some snails and my wife some gnocchi. My wife really enjoyed her gnocchi but i really did not think the same about my snails. then i had some leek with 3 sea scallops. Bearly 1 leek. I dont mind paying a certain price if my food worth it in term of originality. The food i had in my plate i could have done it myself for less than 10 USD with few sea scallops more, however i paid 35 USD for this dish. My wife had a rissotto with 2 shrimps and 2 sea scallops, which did not taste good. wine was not extraordinary  and too expensive for the category.

Will never go back again.",Bad,Good,Bad
"The best view in Chicago, but MEDIOCRE food and service.  We had a reservation for 8pm and didnt' get our table until 9:15pm.  They came by our table 3 times to ask if we wanted anything to drink, we said just water and they finally brought it about 20 minutes later.  Next time they came by our table we went ahead and placed the order, and got our food about an hour later!  Might go back with visitors for the view, but never for the food!",Bad,Good,Bad
"Everything from the service to the food was horrible. After being seated we sat at our table for over 20-30 mnutes before someone even acknowledged & told us our waiter would be with us shortly. The waiter was not knoweldgeable when asked questins his response ""Ive never had it, or chicken is chicken"" then when the main course was brought out they delivered it to the wrong table. The Chicken was so bland comparable to one you'd bake without any seasoning at all & the steak taseted like one from a supermarket we could have cooked at home ourselves.Te salad, forgetting to remove the cheese as asked, was just greens on the plate & everything else missed the mark.The Bathrooms even were not kept up. Napkins to dry your hands were empty & the container overflowing with gross wet kleenex that the customers had to use to dry their hands. The music even was bad going through many genres to the volume up & down. Then the inflated price reflected in our $360. bill was just ridiculous for the entire experience. Oh & not to mention Valet that is typically a courtesy in every other resteraunt is simply a parking garage which cost $28. to have someone park & retrieve our vehicle.  I feel that you could recieve better service at any chain or even fast food for that matter. What a waste of almost $400!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The atmosphere and the staff was great, however the food was just decent.  The high price you pay is for the view and to be treated to a great night out by the staff.  I had a ribeye for  $46, it was comparable to a $20-25 cut of meat at other steakhouses.  Nothing was bad, just didn't demand the price.  On a clear night, the view is awesome.  We had a reservation at 5pm when the restaurant opened.  I recommend to get an early time slot to get a window seat.  They have three sets of seating, by the window, middle row and inner row next to a wall or mirrors.  If we would have not had a window seat, I would have been disappointed.",Bad,Good,Good
The ONLY plus to this place is the view. I cannot boast about anything else whatsoever. A $300+ bill and not one of us was satisfied. We only ordered dessert because we were hungry and thought how could they mess that up- but they did. Rotten bananas were used to make our Bananas Foster!,Bad,Good,
"Had a company holiday event at Cite.  The view is unmatched, the food, however was very disappointing.  I wouldn't return unless it was just for a cocktail while looking at that awesome view.",Bad,Good,
"The views are amazing from the 70th floor. Unfortunately, the food (at least for us) did not match the view. And, at those prices, it should. If you go and have the same experience we did - bland food - be sure to let your waiter know. Ours was great. He comped our bottle of wine and gave us each a free glass of champagne. It helped.",Bad,Good,Good
"The staff was very friendly - and the food was good - not great.  There were some organizational issues in how things were done (like the primary waiter wouldn't pick up plates even when we were clearly done - but seemed to ask his assistant to do so even when he was busy... they should work more as a team versus a supervisor and assistant).  I'd seen bad reviews on the food.  It wasn't a 5-star food experience, but the food was good.  Prices were high, though, for the level of quality.  The view is great.  It wouldn't be worth it to eat there if your table didn't have a great view.",Good,Good,Good
"The view was really nice, but the food and especially the wine was overly marked up. We got an appetizer and soup for 60 dollars. I would recommend it if you have a groupon on do something like that to enjoy the view. We skipped wine because the cheapest bottle was 40 and the cheapest glass was 12. The tuna and salmon tartare and lobster gnocchi were really good appetizers and the lobster bisque and French onion soup were good but the same quality you would expect in a much cheaper steakhouse.",Bad,Good,
Had reservations for Saturday night for the Navy Pier fireworks.  When we arrived we asked for a table near the window and was sat at the bar with 2 other couples waiting for the same.  We didn't even get though one drink when they opened up another section to accomadate us.  Our waiter was very knowlegable of the wines and help us choose an amazing bottle.  The food was good.  Not the best I ever had but definatly up to par.  It is very pricey but the ambiance is great for a special occasion.,Good,Good,Good
"This place is difficult to find and hard to get entrance into the building.  If you go, I suggest you look at Google Street view so you have an idea of the building.   Even when you get to the right location, it's confusing to know which elevator to use and how one gets to the restaurant.


A friend and I made reservations for 9:30 so we could enjoy the restaurant view of the fireworks.   Although the hostess couild not find our reservations (I was contacted later by Open Table as a 'no show'), we were given a choice of 2 different tables, one of which was at the window with a perfect view of Navy Pier.  For about 15 minutes we waited at the table and no one came back with menus.  When someone finally gave us water, we asked for menu's too (still no waiter).   As we were looking through the menu's, a waiter came and suggested to move us to another table which he said was 'more intimate'.  When we replied that we wanted to see the fireworks, he said you 'can see them everywhere'.  We moved, waited longer for him to come back.  To my surprise, when the fireworks did appear, they were mostly out of view at our new table.  In fact, the empty table we left was where everyone was gathering to see the fireworks.   I was really surprised to have beeen treated that way.  As far as the food, we ordered desserts and drinks which were just okay.  They were out of stock of the wine we ordered and got offered no substitute except one of a higher price.  The dessert was just okay-my friend got creme brulee and I had a dessert that had several different samplings of chocolate.  The chocolate dish was served on some kind of slate plate that gave me the sensation of running fingernails on a chalkboard.  It also was not very apetitizing and had a long chocolate log down the middle which I will leave to your imagination as to what that looked like.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"My wife and I had dinner here using a groupon on 8/16. Reservation for 6pm. This restaurant is some 70 stories above Lake Michigan at the top of the Lake Pointe Towers building. The two best things about this dinner were the service and the views. It is a circular dining area and there is not a bad table anywhere for viewing the lake or skyline. Very stunning. Our server, Jason, was very polite and engaging. Made some good suggestions and was very attentive. I hope that it was not just because the dining room was not busy. The food was just okay. Our bill was $168 dollars before the groupon but I have to say that my money would have been better spent at many of the 4000 other restaurants in Chicago. We had two cocktails before dinner and a glass of wine each with dinner. My wife had a heirloom tomato salad, lobster bisque and diver scallops. I had bibb lettuce salad($10), lobster bisque and Atlantic halibut fillet. Her dinner was good but my fillet was so thick it was raw in the center and had to be sent back. I understand that the menu has recently changed but the prices are far too high for the quality of the food we received. Go for drinks and the view or go someplace else.",Bad,Good,Good
"After reading some of the recent reviews, we were a little cautious.  This was our fifth visit to Cite, but our first with the new chef---it was fabulous, possibly the best visit, so far.
Amir, our waiter made suggestions about the menu, taking into consideration what we have ordered on prior visits.  The Filet Mignon was delicious and cooked perfectly at medium-well.  My husband had the Sturgeon, it  was great--firm, low fat type of fish on top of a bed of snow peas--delicious!  One of our friends ordered the lamb---a little on the small size---only 2 pieces of meat, but cooked to order.  One of our friends has a serious shell fish allergy and Amir spoke with the chef to assure that there would not be a problem and took this into account when we were ordering.   I can't say enough about the quality of the food, from salad to the desserts.  The staff were courteous and attentive.  Cite remains our favorite restaurant -- and of course, the view was splendid!",Good,Good,Good
"The view is fantastic and dining room is elegant. The staff is attentive and when you sit down, it feels like a special occassion. We ordered the tasting menu. Our bill was $250 for 2 people( we each had a cocktail and then a glass of house wine) and the food was not good. The lobster bisque tasted like a can of Golden Mushroom soup stirred around with a can of tomato soup and a little piece of lobster in the middle. I chose the filet which was ok- like eating at Outback. My husband got the fish entree and it had no flavor except a lingering fishy taste. Everything else was Ruby Tuesday quality. It was so expensive and did not compare to the other places we chose around the city.",Bad,Good,Good
"BIG letdown.


The restaurant offers fantastic reviews. Stop there. They should just have binoculars and beer.


The service is s-l-o-w. Over 20 minutes just to be recognized at the table. The beverage service is s-l-o-w. 30 minutes for a bottle of champagne to be brought to the table and another half-hour for an ice bucket.


Waiter was knowledgeable but that was whenever we happened to get his attention. Again, S-L-O-W.


The food was okay. The filet mignon was tough and even the steak-knife had a hard time cutting through it. 


Very expensive, ( my fault for ordering champagne) but REALLY Bad and barely adequate food. 


Save your money, don't go.",Bad,Good,Bad
The quickest thing we received was our check. Our waitress was horrible during our two hour stay we saw her 3 times. We were ignored. Waited for mediocre and overpriced food. Save your time and money and dont go there.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"I cannot say enough great things about Cite.  My husband and I had our wedding reception there and it was PERFECT.  


The Event Planner, Jacey is nothing short of wonderful.  We wanted a short engagement and I am not sure we could have hosted such a great event without Jacey's help.  She made sure everything was seamless from coordinating the tasting, to making sure the restaurant was arranged perfectly to working with the band etc... there was not a single glitch.


Cite Restaurant is phenomenal.  The food is outstanding and all our guests commented on how much they enjoyed it.  The staff is accommodating and met the needs of all of our demanding guests. 


Cite is the perfect venue to host an intimate event.  I would highly encourage anyone planning a wedding reception in Chicago to consider Cite.


For those visiting Chicago this is a wonderful restaurant and the view is breathtaking.  Every part of the experience exceeded those at similar restaurants in the city.",Good,Good,Good
"the view is excellent, the food is superb and the waitstaff is very pleasing.  Although the menu is pricy, the view pays for itself. Also, the best steak i have ever had! no lie! and i have been to a lot of steakhouses. The maitre d' was very nice, she even gave us a couple of complimentary champagne glasses, on the house! This restaurant is perfect for a romantic getaway, i definitely recommend it!",Good,Good,Good
"I wanted a special evening for a speciel occasion for my lovely wife...and this was even much better than expected! We had a very nice table like asked, the people there were very friendly, the food was superb, the view in this restaurant astonishing !! We had a really unforgetable night, the service perfect and the bill not cheep but within normal range. After diner we had a nice evening in the bar, a talk with a very friendly ""ma√Øtre"" Amirnwith a very good Belgian beer ! This was a contrast with the ""forced kindness"" in a lot of other restaurants in this region... REALLY A MUST IN CHICAGO !!",Good,Good,Good
"The view is wonderful. The staff is friendly. We booked our table 8 weeks in advance on opentable.com because it was the Marathon weekend and many places were slammed. When we arrived, we were ushered into the small bar. Nobody had prepared our table. We waited 20 minutes for this.Unbelievable.


The food was skimpy and overpriced. One person had a scallop appetizer and got a quarter size scallop and a hunk of greens.


I ordered the Fruits de Mer Risotto. The risotto was quite good, but there were 2 small tasteless shrimps, 2 tiny scallops and a few cut up pieces of dry, tasteless lobster. A  total ripoff. We took our clients to Ravenous the nest night and spent $400 less and had an amazing dinner. The food here was below average, especially for the price. A few people were still hungry after we left! Skip this place.",Bad,Good,Good
"It's everything they promised.  Book online to request the view that's right for you, and enjoy the wonderful menu and fantastic service.",Good,Good,Good
"LOVED it! Free taste offerings from the new chef, recommend the Fruit De Mer Risotto, Best Views of the City. We didn't even mind not seeing the fireworks that got canceled. Hubby says best part of our Chicago trip!",Good,Good,Good

The Service is excelent, the food is delicious.
The price is high but worth it.",Good,Good,Good
"This is a luxury restaurant at the top of Lake Point Towers.  The food is good , but the star here is the view.  We watched the sun set over the city--pink reflections on the glass walls of sky scrapers.  At the same time you see the sail boats and cruisers on Lake Michigan.  Plus, our food was good. It's very expensive, but great for entertaining clients or for a special occasion.",Good,Good,
Love Cite! Very romantic atmosphere!,,Good,
"This used to be one of our favorite restaurants for special occasions.  The food and service used to be excellent, no longer. The last time we were there the food was average at best,  the waiter tried to cheat us on our bill (I gave the benefit of the doubt and thought it was accidental until I read another review here that said the same thing) and we also were not told about the tip being added to our bill and double tipped. My husband called up the next day and let them hear about that. This restaurant has gone very far downhill and I would not go here again until there is a new owner and better reviews. View is still best in Chicago. I would take visitors up there just to sit at the bar and admire the view, but skip dinner.",Bad,Good,Bad
"Cite' has a beautiful impressive view but that is about all it has to offer.  It definitely was not what we remember it to be a few years ago.  The decor is dated the waiter was extremely impersonal.  He only smiled when he delivered our check. The other staff was very friendly.   I ordered salmon and expected it to melt in my mouth, instead it was very tough with little flavor.",Bad,Good,Good
"I had a very pleasant and tasty meal at cite with a business colleague.  I am an experienced traveller and am very familiar with fine dining.  This meal was enjoyable, but not spectacular.  The service was very friendly and polite; although they are not nearly as professional as one might expect from such a costly restaurant.  The views are amazing!  Overall a rather pleasant experience - but I'll admit, it's bit overpriced.",Good,Good,Good
"It's my fault.  I read the reviews and ignored them.  We arrived at the restaurant and noticed it was half empty.  Strange for a 70th floor restaurant when fireworks are scheduled.  We ordered wine and when it arrived it was room temp.  Not a problem except that the room was 82 F.  I went to find my waiter (he was the only waiter that I saw) and noticed that they only had a small portable a/c unit by the bar.  No way would it cool the place. When the waiter came to take our order he insisted that we order our appetizer with our meal.  I insisted that he bring us our appetizer and then I would order the entrees.  That was the last I saw of him.  After they brought our appetizers (they where good) we sat as he went back and forth by our table.  So we all got up and stood at the front until we got the bill.  The food we had was good, Very understaffed, Wine is not stored properly, very hot inside.  There are so many great places to eat in Chicago, don't waste your time and money on this one.  If you want a great view go to the John Hancock Building.",Good,Bad,Bad
This restaurant greatly inconveniences patrons by requiring a detailed credit card pre-authorization form be faxed to secure a reservation for certain days in the year.  This is not only terrible service but highly inconvenient and insulting.  Furthermore this speaks very badly for the classiness of the establishement implying that either their customers are of a demographic prone to leaving without paying their bill or the experience of diners is sometimes so bad that they refuse to pay the bill.  Such inconvenient policies suggest that standards for Good are not what they should be and punish innocent patons by assuming they are all would-be thieves.  I believe Good dictates that an establishement deal with its own inconvenieces in a fashion as transparent to patrons as possible.  I refuse to continue dining there in the future.,,Bad,Bad
"Cite restaurant is a total waste. Quanity and quality of food is poor. Had to wait over 50 minutes for appetizers to be delivered. Watch your bill carefully, restaurant will add 20% tip to your bill with party of 6+ people. Waiter tried to cheat us on the bill by adding 20% tip for food and another 20% tip for drinks, totaling 40% tip!!!! Rediculous! In my case, with party of 8, at least, paying over a $1000 for dinner at Cite, I would not be cheated on the bill.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Great location and vibe - awful service! Waited over 30 minutes for a drink while seated at the bar. Staff is more concerned with stocking the bar than waiting on customers. Instead of waiting on us, we were asked to move so that the server could get in a cabinet behind me.",,Good,Bad
Overhyped scene. Rude hostess who is clearly overwhelmed. Showed us to a table for 2 that was missing a chair. Took too long to get the chair. Too long to take our order. Too long to bring the water. Had to ask for more water three times. Food is fine but def not great - lots of better brunch places. Not sure why it‚Äôs so popular. Or why they take so many reservations when they are clearly overwhelmed by the onslaught.,Bad,Bad,Bad
There was a bug in my friends drink and the waiter was like ‚Äúwhat do you want me to do about it?‚Äù and was absolutely rude to us for no reason and refused to get her a new drink. I was like ‚Äúdo you expect her to drink the rest of it?‚Äù And he was like ‚Äúshe already has been.‚Äù while there was more than half of the drink still left. He was disgustingly rude. Don‚Äôt go here. Bugs. Horrible service.,Bad,Bad,Bad

"Very rude and disrespectful staff.


 We called for a reservation to watch f1 race and the person attending the call sounded like the biggest fan ever.


Except when you got to the rez, the staff was indifferent and insensitive. Further they said 90min rez limit but gave us the check the minute we finished food. And eventually asked us to move ever before the limit. We asked for drinks and they said not here but at the bar (which was already full).",,Bad,Bad
"Horrible. Super packed, worst service, awful music. Just don‚Äôt go. Waste of your time and money. We went there on a Sunday because we heard it was fun. Well.. it wasn‚Äôt!!!! Just don‚Äôt waste your Sunday afternoon on a place like this.",,Bad,Bad
"Walked by and stopped in for lunch with my mom and we had a horrible experience. We had meant to go to La Sirene (which is amazing) but didn‚Äôt realize they weren‚Äôt open yet so came here instead. The host, who was also our waiter, was rude from the beginning, getting angry when I asked for a minute to look at the menu before ordering and not coming back for almost 10 minutes. He then proceeded to ignore us for another 20-30 minutes; every other table had gotten their food already and we hadn‚Äôt even gotten our bread yet. When we asked about it he simply said he‚Äôs busy and threw down a bread basket but no plates. Our food came and I realized they had completely forgotten my mom‚Äôs request for a salad instead of fries. When it was time to go I asked for my order to be packed to go. We waited a few minutes only to be informed that the guy actually threw out all of our remaining food. Someone else who I assume is the boss had an order remade for me, which was probably the only positive thing from our entire experience here. Also the duck confit is extremely dry.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Simply does not live up to the hype. 
Heard about this place from our hotel, booked for our group as pre evening drinks & bite. 
They acted like we were annoying them as soon as we arrived (we had pre-booked days before but they had oversold and did not have space so had to get a sh1tty make-shift table together for us). The staff actually said ‚Äúugh s**t it‚Äôs a group‚Äù to each other in front of us. 
The wait staff were rude and pushy, the food is very average pub food and the drinks were watery bin-juice. The bill was excessive for crap food, service & drinks & they applied a huge tip into our bill at checkout without giving us the option. 
The space itself it beyond old, not cool ‚ÄòFrench/nyc old school bistro‚Äô; but old crap decor, desperately needs an update & clean (and change of attitude) 
They must survive on the ‚Äúyou occasionally see celebs there‚Äù which people seem to throw around.

"The music and vibe of the restaurant has the potential for it to be great. However, it was such an awful experience with the wait staff that I would never go back. After a few minutes of getting seated, the waiter asked for our order which we asked for a glass of rose and plate of fries. The waiter yelled at us saying we can't order appetizers and we have to order only mains because they have 400 people coming that day. I said we were planning to order mains just wanted to start with an appetizer and needed a few more minutes to look at the menu. He kept yelling at us and left while yelling. Then the hostess came by and said if we weren't eating then we would have to move to the bar. We never said we weren't going to order a main dish, we just asked for an appetizer in addition to mains. This was fully made up and the first of many times they tried to get us to leave. Then finally the waiter came back over to order. I had to reorder the wine since he clearly wasn't listening to us the first time, and just yelling at us. Then after 45 minutes, they made us move tables to accommodate another group. Then they gave us the check without us asking if we wanted anything else (dessert, another drink). I put my card down and was drinking my wine when the waiter came back over to yell at us for not paying yet since they have many people waiting. My card was there waiting for him to charge it and he was just yelling at us for absolutely no reason. We paid and were sitting finishing our drinks for about 10 more minutes. We had been at the restaurant less than an hour and a half. Another hostess came by and told us they have so many people waiting and we paid so long ago and that we had to leave. I told her we had been there less than an hour and a half and just needed a few more minutes to finish drinks. She, like all the other waiters we interacted with, did not listen to a word I was saying and continued to say how many people were waiting for that table. Awful experience for what was supposed to be a nice Sunday brunch. On top of everything that happened, they require all tables of any size to tip 20%. Probably because people would tip so poor if they didn't include this. Even though the place is apparently an historic place to go to, I wouldn't choose to go back to a place where they wanted you to leave from the moment you got there.",,Bad,Bad
Food was great and the atmosphere was cozy.  I found the bar stool and bar area a bit uncomfortable. If you want to eat a table is more suitable . Over all great time though,Good,Good,
"We had a very rude waiter. We stopped in for lunch to get out of the heat. There was 1 air conditioner which didn't seem like it was working. They played the music so loud we couldn't hear each other talking. We accidentally forgot to mention a food allergy to the waiter. So, when he brought my wife's salad she was allergic to the dressing. We told him he rudely told us he only brought what we ordered and if we wanted another we would have to pay for it. At over 20$ for a salad, we said no thank you. 10 minutes later he came back out and just plopped the plate down and said ""here's your salad , no dressing"". Would never recommend this place to anybody",,Bad,Bad
"This place is garbage. A quintessential overrated, overpriced restaurant that just sees its customers as ATM's. We made a reservation in advance for 6 people. These people have the nerve to seat us over 30 minutes late, not bring half our order, and then pressure us to buy a magnum bottle of rose, which costs $300+ as there is a minimum. We said we would prefer to order individual drinks as no one wanted wine. They REFUSED to take our drink orders because we did not purchase a bottle. I went up to the manager and clearly told her we were not aware that there was a minimum at the table (the reservation didn't mention ANYTHING) OR that we were held accountable to order rose. She simply said ""if you don't like it, then leave"". And leave we did, leaving a 5% tip.


Never going here again, and if you have any self respect, you won't either.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"There is nothing wrong with this place but I left rather unconvinced about everything!
Service was OK;
The wine had some teething problems;
The food was OK;

"On Yelp this place has 2.5 Stars.  Here it is one higher.  Both ratings should be lower.  


There is a reason why this place has low ratings.  Actually, this restaurant should be avoided at all times.  It's not because of the food, but rather the people and the attitude that this place fosters.  Very unpleasant experience here.  Trust me on this one.  There are many other places to dine in New York.  Don't waste your time, your money, and your sanity.",,Bad,Bad

"Interesting evening.  We got there early for our reservation.  Not many tables were taken so we jumped in. We took a nice table in the corner and had actually a really good meal with pretty Good.  Soup, salads, moules frites, steak and cassoulet were all quite good.   Zero complaints...   Good. 


Then it got interesting.  We were sitting chatting and basically ready to go after a little over an hour and a half.   We were the only ones left in the restaurant at 9 pm.   9 pm on a Thursday in manhattan.  


We hadn‚Äôt asked for a check and they hadn‚Äôt brought one.  All evening in a French restaurant there had been Cuban music playing fairly loudly.  Not sure why but it was good and festive so all good.  Suddenly as were sitting there the lights get brighter and the music got louder.  We looked at each other like did that really happen ?   They haven‚Äôt brought us a check and it‚Äôs 9 pm and they are basically telling us to leave ?   We chuckled.   Then it got even brighter and louder and the staff was giving us the stink eye. 


Kind of amazing.   Worth a chuckle.   All they had to do was bring a check.  


On the other hand, super rude.  


So, neat spot.  Good to really Good.  Good.  Weird ending early in an evening.  Had read one review earlier that said they were asked to leave after a certain amount of time.   Similar to that I guess but did it through lights and blaring music vs handing us a check as we were already set to go.",Good,Good,Good
"Felix Brasserie has been a staple of soho and French cuisine as well as French football for decades ... 
It‚Äôs not only a classic of French cuisine and French Fun but also a beacon in our community Felix Is like a family member you like to visit when you need to be truly restored ..
In a recent visit where the chill of The season will freeze even your bones i pushes the bistro doors and asked Jeff the Bar tender for an onion soup one of my favorite here but He suggested instead la soupe du jour country vegetables and poulet organic prepared by the maestro himself Chef Pierre Landet who has reinvented the cuisine here since 2012.
I love it and I believe you will too 
The service is friendly and professional the food is consistently great I give this bistro a 4 Pascalpicks rating and recommend you do yourself if in in soho for lunch and dinner and if you want dance and have fun go there on Brunch you will be amazed .

I was with my family spending a nice afternoon until one of the waitresses told us to leave because we had already spent two hours at the restaurant!! INCREDIBLE!!! The waitress was rude and used obscene words because we did not want to leave!! We bought a three Lts. wine bottle, lunch for six people, we asked for another wine bottle and they demand us just got out for no reason!!! If I'm two hours at a restaurant not consuming I would understand the situation, yet, THIS WAS NOT OUR CASE!! My friends, believe me, you do not want to have a bad time going there.",,Bad,Bad

"Felix is always on our list when visiting New York. We made a reservation for brunch at 10am, since it used to be always packed. Arrived a little late and were surprised we were the only guests on a Saturday! We got a nice table and ordered food and drinks, which arrived promptly, but staff was not very friendly, never smiled and only talked when asked. We felt like we were disturbing his otherwise peaceful Saturday! More guests arrived later, but the place was still more than half empty when we left around 12 noon. I hope this gets better, otherwise we'll have to skip Felix in the future!",,Bad,Bad
"After waiting 10 minutes to be served and visiting the toilet that absolutely stunk! We should have gone with our instincts and left! The food was as tasteless as the experience. Avoid avoid avoid! Not sure why they insist on cash or Amex? Had it been perfect, it would still be overpriced.
An embarrassment to France!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Pricing that is already way over the top, was apparently not enough for this restaurant after providing lousy service. On a party of 5 they were trying to get away with a sneaky automatic 20% tip added to the check. I was so offended that I refused it and the MD said she would take it off. Needless to say I found out later on my CC that this had not been done. Avoid! This is a tourist trap!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This restaurant has been here for many years and has it's following. Family members had recommended it as a downtown favorite and I made a first visit there with them.


We ordered from the brunch menu while sampling a presentable cheese board which was supported by more than sufficient tasty, fresh bread.


People enjoyed their salads and hamburger but I have to say the Smoked Salmon Omelet was a disappointment. Trying to eat the omelet with a knife and fork was barely possible due to the structure of this omelet. The eggs had been cooked and once cool, chunks of very, repeat very salty smoked salmon were dropped on the surface before the eggs were folded over. The result was that the salmon and eggs were seperate and the lumps of fish just dropped off the fork.


In most cases the contents added to an omelet are either mixed in with the eggs then cooked or folded in while the eggs are soft. At Felix they are not.


Not only was the fish extremely salty but to add insult the coffee ordered with the omelet failed to appear. The server had to be hunted down before that happened.


This is also an extremely loud venue so do not expect to hear anyone at your table unless you are sitting next to them.",Bad,Bad,

"We had a late night dinner after checking in to our hotel, following a long day of travel.
We sat for around 10 minutes before our waiter came over and took a drink order.
We never saw him again until I stopped him for a dessert menu.
Our water glasses remained empty until I finally asked to have them filled.
In addition, my husband never got the goat cheese salad he ordered.
We asked for the check and noted that he had added a 20% gratuity to our party of 3.
When questioned, Antonio stated that it was automatically added to every check.
I pointed out that the menu said ‚Äúparty of 6 or more‚Äù.
At that point, he said that he could take it off.
I chose to leave it on the bill and write this review instead.
I am a firm believer in Karma......",,Bad,Bad
"I went here on a Friday evening and the food was okay. Nothing refined, but if you‚Äôre going out with friends that‚Äôs not necessarily what you are looking for. A famous Michelin star chef once told me that service is as important, or even more so, than the work being done in the kitchen. And I agree! And how utterly amazed we were encountering the unbelievable rudeness and inattentiveness, we witnessed at Felix. And that in New York where service normally is impeccable. Even the worst service in Paris cannot compete with what we witnessed at Felix. So if you like to be badly treated, ignored, frowned upon and approached with uncalled arrogance, this is the place to go. I have checked other reviews and am afraid my experience wasn‚Äôt a one-off.",Good,Bad,Bad

"I have not written a review here in quite some time but this restaurant was so poor in service I was compelled to.


Please note this restaurant is cash and American Express only. Please tell them in advance should you want your bill split. Food was good. Server was indifferent to us (no water offered, knew I was looking for a pasta dish but never offered up the daily pasta as an option for me). When asked about the meals just said they were good, no effort to explain how anything was prepared or done. Menu clearly states 20% gratuity for 6 or more but nothing about an 18% tip for a table of four. Server added 18% tip for himself to our bill. It was removed when we asked about it.
No apologies for not being able to split our bill. We did not notice the AMEX / Cash only note on the menu and server could have cared less. Probably happens all the time and gets tired of explaining it too patrons.",Good,Bad,Bad

The ma√Ætre D was interesting, aloof etc., but that didn‚Äôt dampened our excellent evening. We ordered a nice bottle of Gigondas, the striploin steak with scallop potatoes and bone marrow and the dick with its foie gras!  All was fantastic, and the atmosphere was great. Many ex-pats that didn‚Äôt make you feel like they owned the place. The service was also very good. Highly recommended for adults only on the evening.",Good,Good,Good
"Great place for lunch if you like being jammed packed and don‚Äôt seek private conversations. Food is typical French bistro style, and portions are good. The part that really irked me is the service (or lack thereof) at the bar. The bar is an afterthought at Felix. The bar tender (a gentleman from Colombia) had a ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù attitude from the get go and provided a service below par in NYC. We stayed there for a couple hours and I don‚Äôt believe he made eye contact once. Go there to eat, but avoid that bar at all cost. If the poor service doesn‚Äôt do it, the poor quality sound speaker system will most certainly be a red flag of overall poor management.",Good,Good,Bad
"We had brunch here with others, and cannot criticize the restaurant, but it was not what we wanted.  It is fairly typical of europe, but there was not a healthy choice on the menu.  One of of ordered a goat cheese salad, which was tiny despite not being advertised as a side.  One of us had a burger, which was overcooked (well, not medium) and in European fashion, a diet coke came out in a ""rocks"" glass-sure that refills would be by the ""each"".  Everything was served with fries (sorry, frites).  Really wanted toast, scrambled eggs, maybe yogurt, but it this is what you are in the mood for they do a good job.

Definitely enjoyed this un\expected find.",Good,Good,Good

Then removed it without asking if we wanted anything. We did. So I called him back and gave our order. Also how ridiculous. They only take Amex or cash. It‚Äôs 2017!!! And we‚Äôre in the USA. So then I had to use their ATM and pay a 2.50 surcharge to withdraw money for the overpriced dinner!!! Steak was lovely so if waiters had been a little more hospitable I wouldn‚Äôt be writing this.

"Amazing cornered location on West Broadway, a block from Canal street and the Soho Grand hotel. Typical french bistro with professional and mostly french waitstaff.

This is why i called it for locals only, this is the kind of place that you need to explore multiple times to understand it and in return felix, and their owners Alain and Alex and the staff will treat you as family!Garanteed! over 30years running, it ain't luck! it's Hospitality!",Good,Good,Good

"Went there tonight with my friend. Everything went ok until the waiter thought appropriate to tell us that we basically didn't leave enough tip. We had split the bill in two and he asked if we left the tip only on one half of the bill?? He was very serious, I told him we were not from the US and are not familiar with tiping practice, he said he is not from the US either (he's French) and the appropriate tiping would be 15 to 20%. Now, they may live on tips in the US but no one needs to be rude about it. My friend and I have worked in hospitality for years and never ever have experienced such remarks. After that I actually felt like removing the tip we left but it was too late. 
They don't deserve the clientele with such attitude, so many other lovely restaurants in the area. Service was ok but nothing special.

"Wow - I see some reviewers have had a real bummer here. So far I am pleased to say this has not been our experience. We usually stay at the Soho Grand so this is like a neighborhood local and that is what is - a reliable , down home , local bistro. Typically we go for brunch or lunch and have always enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and easy dining. The spicy lamb sausage / salad nicoise / steak tartare / tuna tartare , to name a few , have always been on the money in terms of both quality and price. So - nothing special - just a pleasant , easy going type of bistro - gear your expectations accordingly and you should not be disappointed .",Good,Good,
"This was without doubt the worse service experience we have ever had. Our waiter was inattentive, defensive, argumentative,and incredibly arrogant.......French arrogant.

"‚Å†‚Å†After hearing so many great things about Felix, we decided to celebrate my sister‚Äôs birthday there! 


There was a large group of 17 of us and they seated us after having to wait for a long time. 


We found a large plastic piece in our eggs Benedict and a piece of hair in our pitcher of mimosa! So we called the manager and she was not apologetic at all. She quickly moved the plate away so that other guests would not see what happened! The waiter was being very apologetic but very inappropriate by touching and kissing our hand which was very disrespectful.


Moreover, while we were seated, the manager moved  the table away from us so she could seat other guests. Once we informed her that we were still being seated she condescendingly shouted, ""do you want the whole restaurant?!"" Soon after, the waiter bought the cheque because they intended to make us leave.

"We were a group of 15 people, there for a friends birthday. This was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Food SUCKED: the omelet was watery, the salad was NOT fresh. The drinks were somewhat okay. The service was good ONLY by Mohammed who was super sweet, but the manager treated us like we were outcasts just because we didn't speak French / were a big group. 


To start off, a friend got her omelet with a nice big piece of plastic in it, which she found while cutting through to take a bite. She could've choked on it. To make up for that mess, they gave us a free bottle of rose. Alright, cause that makes up for almost killing my friend. 


After that, we found a guys hair in one of our Mimosa pitchers, and when we told the server, he said ""you can mess with the food but not with the drinks"" indicating that we put in the piece of plastic in the dish and we dropped the hair into the drink to get free stuff. We let it go cause we didn't want to argue/create a scene on a friends birthday, and we promptly asked for the cheque. 


After being there for 2 hours and ordering enough food/drinks for about $1000, the manager, Tia, came up to the same friend who found a piece of plastic in her food, and started yelling (almost verbally abusing) her telling us we need to leave and we can't order any more drinks because they needed the table for other people. We would've totally understood and left had she been nice and told us in a more mature and calm way. It was disgusting the way she treated my friend, and the attack came out of nowhere!! 


Overall, the worst experience i've had at a restaurant in New York. Felix, you need a new manager with a sense of etiquette, who knows how to treat customers properly.",Bad,Bad,Bad

"Felix was one of my favorite restaurants for Sunday's brunch when I used to live in NYC
I actually returned often when I was visiting NY
Today I am in NY and I had all my family and I insisted to go to Felix and : what a disappointment!!
The services was very average : the waiter was blunt. I asked to add mushrooms to my omelette and He answer ' we serve things here the way they are but I can pass the request to the chef' Really ??? Mushrooms ?
Our cappuccino tasted 'foamy milk' so I order a double espresso to mix it and off course that would make a $8 cappuccino.
And when the bill came : No credit cards !!
Only AMEX, what? That's new !
Specially when our bill for 2 eggs Benedict one omelette (spinach and thanks god some mushrooms) 2 mimosas 1 hamburger and 2 cappuccinos was $172 dollars 
WOW ! I live in Bermuda and high prices don't impress me when I travel but this bill and cash threw me out !!
I have to stars because my spinach and mushrooms omelette really 'hit the spot'
Unfortunately : this is the last time I will go to Felix where I visit NY and I won't recommended to my friends either ! Sorry !

The worst though was when it came to the cheque, they only accept cash or American Express. No Visa no Mastercard, so I had to use their own ATM which charged an additional $2.50 for the withdrawal (and this doesn't include the fee the bank charges for a private ATM on top). This was never mentioned before, and when I finally payed in cash they even expected to not want change, so I had to ask them to bring me change so I could choose how much Tip I wanted to add.
Won't go here again for sure.",Good,Bad,Bad
Happy to find is little gem on a cold & rainy day. Nothing a bowl of mussels and glass a vino can't fix.,Good,,
I have been to Felix with a group of friends on a Sunday afternoon. It's definitely the best and coolest Bruch place in New York!,Good,Good,
"Visited on Sunday for brunch with the family. Great food and service. Best caipirinha in NYC!!


Would defiantly go again. Make sure to reserve as the place gets very busy",Good,Good,Good
"Everything about Felix, is like a return to every casual French Bistro that
You've ever visited in France. From the escargot, to the cassoulet, to the
Creme Br√ªl√©e, everything is delicious. The chef/owner, Pierre Landet, is
always in the kitchen, and has a welcoming and warm personality. The 
Wines are wonderful, and the atmosphere matches. A drop pricey, but worth
every penny. Located in the charming section of Soho, in Manhattan, after a
day of strolling, Felix is the place to wind up! Enjoy",Good,Good,Good
"Today my wife and I had brunch here. She had been here with her girlfriends six months ago. I thought this place would be nice for brunch on and 60¬∞ day in New York City. We ordered two black coffees, two bloody Mary's, a salad nicoise, and a salmon omelet. Seeing this cool atmosphere, we  were expecting many great things. However, The service was absolutely horrible. When I received my dish, it was not a salmon omelette. Instead it was salmon eggs Benedict. The server insisted that it was a salmon omelette. However, I ate his error, and the salmon eggs Benedict was pretty good . It Took repeated request to have our coffee refilled. And when we finally got our check, we had been overcharged for four bloody Mary's instead of two. When I Asked our server, he made it seem that it was my fault. I would not recommend this restaurant since they are not honest and they make excuses for poor service.",Good,Bad,Bad
"We were booked into The SoHo Grand Hotel and decided to try dinner at the Felix Cafe, located very close to the hotel. We arrived shortly before 7 and got a great table but that was the end of the greatness. The service was awful despite the fact that the place was near empty. The food (except for the onion soup) was passable at best. We had heard that the place has a great lunnch but we did not experience that for dinner.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Firstly, it's very telling of weather management is customer focused or not when they only accept American Express. No a huge issue but telling. I believe that you should want to make the customer experience exceptional and easy. Easy is simple accept what has become Tradional methods of payment. It's kinda like a no return policy in retail. I do have an American Express card but would of chosen not to use it. That rant being said; The food was average and the services just ok. I will not go back and recommend that you try one of the other amazing restaurants in the area.",,,Bad
"I totally love this place. I use to come here many years ago when I lived in NYC, and I came back this year for a Sunday brunch to confirm that it still is as nice as I remembered it. 


I came with a bunch of friends, but we did not have a reservation and we almost did not find a place to seat, because the place is packed specially on Sundays.


I ordered the steak tartar which I totally recommend.",Good,Good,
"Dropped in without reservation on a Saturday night at 7pm and plenty of tables free. Nicely seated in a lovely atmosphere and not so hungry so the French onion soup, pate, and cheese plate appertizers were enough. Lovely food and nicely lit little French place although we entered assuming it was Brazilian due to the flags outside. Four waiters served us in total so not very personal so a lower rating than could have easily been achieved with the Good. Give it a try...",Good,Good,Good
"The meal was pretty good but a bit expensive. The service was OK. However, they only accepted American Express card or cash!!! I could not believe that happening in the US, especially in a place like NYC. That is an old fashion way to pay in 2016....unless the owner has a deal with American Express. Obviously, there is a cash machine inside the restaurant and that could be another way for the owner to make extra profit...
The presence of Brazilian and French flags outside the restaurant is confusing in terms of the identity of the place, considering the food is mostly French.",Good,,Good
"The weather was perfect for us to sit where the windows opened on to the street so we had fun people watching all during our lunch. The service was just ok but the food was fresh, flavorful and beautifully presented.


The clientele was another interesting mix-lots of French speaking diners but also other nationalities so it felt very European.",Good,Good,Good
The food was excellent; and the service was sassy but fun.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.,Good,Good,Good
"What an awful place! Arrogant, rude, incompetent waiters and overpriced Bad and drinks. Be smart, and go elsewhere.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Food was good. Had salmon and some appetizers.  Service a bit slow and host a bit arrogant.  Great location. Expect $100 per person with drink. Seating a bit cramped but it's NYC in soho. Indifferent as to a must go place.,Good,,Bad
"I met here with 2 other couples for a brunch and was extremely disappointed. The doorman was rude and didn't acknowledge our reservation. He let half of our group in and then proceeded to yell at the rest of our group when they tried to enter. It was so poorly run and the staff was running around without any type of organization. To top it off, while we were waiting for our table by the bar, a staff manager proceeded to shove me and then yell at me for being ""in the way"" and told me we should just leave. I have never been treated with more disrespect in my life. And I'm a New Yorker, born and raised and this restaurant is a disgrace to soho. I will NEVER go back here.",,Bad,Bad
"Nice little French bistro. Simple food but very good. French onion soup was delicious as was the Salade de ch√®vre chaud
Perfect for a simple lunch
Good selection of wines by the glass
One minus - it could do without the monster TV showing sports",Good,,
"Had a quick brunch here the other day and was ok with the indifferent service and tight quarters, but the food was bland and boring.  Nothing to write home about...Soho has so much more to offer elsewhere.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had lunch here, 4 people total.
The food was okay, nothing special or bad but expensive for my taste.


I will say we're used to cheaper places in general and I'm assuming being in SoHo had its costs.",Bad,,
"Ok let's start with the positive... the situation is cool.
But service was rude, food was under average and soon expensive.
The staff had a meeting in the middle of the restaurant and start to be very nervous.. mood was terrible.
There is plenty of wonderful small restaurant all around to avoid this terrible one (Lucky Strike just in front in 10x better and 10x cheaper for exemple).",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Bottom line, French onion soup was excellent but the rest of the meal was uneventful . . Plenty of steak options but I had the free range chicken with seasoning and it was fine,not overwhelming . . .my partner had a salad and she was underwhelmed by the freshness of it . .",Bad,,
Felix is always accommodating to larger groups.  We were there for nearly 3 hours.  Steak frites as good as ever and a good selection of reasonable priced food.,Good,Good,
"A mainstay of soho since as long as I've been in New York. You can always get a table here on a Friday night which is nice. They can also accommodate larger groups. The escargot are good, though what in butter and garlic isn't? And the moules are a large portion with a nice broth. The staff is friendly as well.",Good,Good,Good
"If it was only for the quality of the food and the decoration of the place I would have given five stars. The meat was excellent and the place is really designed like a proper French restaurant. It's expensive, but for the quality of the food and the location I guess that is to be expected. There are a number of problems with this place that have a negative impact on the experience though. First the loud banging music, which causes people to shout in order to speak with each other. Very un-French. Second, the servers are cleary under pressure to deliver a quick turnover. I lifted the last piece of ham from the plate of my starter, and while I put it in my mouth they immediately removed the plates and put down our main courses. Especially at a dinner I would want a little bit of time to digest the starter before receiving the main course. Third, and this is the most serious problem, 20% gratuity was added straight to the bill. That should be forbidden.",Good,Bad,Bad
"We visited this restaurant on a sunny September afternoon and sat in the window taking in the views on Soho.  


Its is like you are sitting in a typical French Bistro, the round brown tables and chairs, the typical A3 Bistro Menus, even the Table D'Hote menu.


We had just got off a flight from London so we made a selection of a number of starters and Mussells & Frites and shared the selection which was perfect. We washed it all down with 2 bottles of French Chablis. Perfect start to our weekend in New York.


Was not cheap but considering it is in Soho and the position on the corner etc not surprised by the prices. People have mentioned the service, but our service was good because loads of staff working as Lunchtime on a Thursday. We did have a situation where the staff thought we had not given a big enough tip, so we increased this.",Good,Good,Good
"There are three reasons you like a restaurant/caf√©, and no specific order 1) food, 2) service, 3) je ne said quoi ‚Äî in the perfect place the three mix seamlessly as if meant to be, in others you have to decide on the moment where your heart (or stomach, or patience) lives. The Felix is one of those perfectly beautiful places you might over look in France because there are many, in NYC (or the US) not so much. It sits on the corner and all it's window take in the street world of Soho. I have visited this place multiple times over the years, I love to think and write here. I call it my ""Yes, No, Yes Caf√©"" ‚Äî food Yes, service No, ambiance Yes. So, unlike some, I ignore the service, which is generally pretentious, pompous and in an old French way, frustratingly annoying (even though most of the staff are not french.) But then I have always seen them as characters in a novel I will write, or a magazine piece I am sketching as I sit there. This is NYC, there are a million places to enjoy the service - enjoy the Felix for everything else.",Good,Good,Bad
"I was going to leave an unsatisfied review about the food and service but instead it has changed into a warning. When you use your American Express card - which Felix does accept, pay attention to the charges. My partner's card was overcharged and the management at Felix were completely blas√© about it as if this has happened before. 


For quality French dining of comparable costs without the b.s., I'd recommend Balthazar.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We just walked through Soho and saw this nice cafe. We had a table ""in the windows"". We were waiting but nobody was coming to ask for our order. Even if we had eye contact with the waiters a couple of times, they were not coming. We even took the menue cards on our own from another table... The place was not realy crowdy, so this was absolutely not understandable for us. After approx. 15 minutes we left and nobody took care of it. So the service was really bad, the rest cannot be scored as we couldn't experieced it.",,Bad,Bad
"Felix is one of my favorite spots in New York, my ""go-to"" place when we are in SoHo, but yesterday was a big disappointment. The waiter was more interested in making a tip, than in paying attention to service. First off, when we asked for water he brought bottled water instead of tap. Then he added 18% to the check without informing us. Bad choice.",,Bad,Bad
"The food was OK but it's a small space and the people that work there take themselves too serious. For a cafe, which are many around the city and a lot much better, they make ordering too complicated. We had 9 people order food, 3 pitchers of mojitos and they still would not give me a beer unless I order bottle service - if it was a club. 


The menu has a few options and most were good, the burger and Benedict was but it was difficult eating with a lot of noise and the tables on top of each other.


Will never come back",Good,Bad,Bad
"I've enjoyed Felix now for many years and appreciate their continuity in a neighborhood where shops and restaurants roll over quickly once they are no longer the newest face on the block.  Brunch continues to be a fun and raucous time at Felix but dinner the other night was a bit lackluster and for the price, that wasn't what I expected.  One of us had the bouillabaisse, and it was quite good but the entrecote and the chicken were just OK and the presentation was sloppy.  I couldn't recommend this to anyone in a city full of fine restaurants.  The final straw, they only accept Amex or cash, the latter handy in their fee-charging ATM.  Really??!!",Bad,Bad,
I went here for lunch today. I was very unimpressed. The service was poor. The food was OK but overpriced. Five dollars for a small watered down glass of pop seemed a bit much. They do not take Visa or MasterCard although we were not told of this at any point until the end of the meal. Plenty of better restaurants to choose from in Soho,Bad,Bad,Bad
"This place is only for those looking to drink great wine, enjoy a party atmosphere, and eat French food


The place turns into a top-notch party on Sundays - Takes Sunday Funday to a new level


This place is a staple in my repertoire",Good,Good,
was an OK meal at Felix.  Patrons do feel crammed in.  Didn't like the way that as the restaurant got busier the music went louder and it became more difficult to chat.  Food was tasty though -- maybe the wrong place for me,Good,Bad,
"Nice bistro with good quality food and wine - we had tuna tartare and beef carpaccio for starters and roasted chicken and steam mussels for mains. While the food was good, we had a grumpy waiter attended to us. It was a nice, sunny and windy day - we were seated at a table which was near the door and hence the wind blew the paper table covering relentlessly. We mentioned this to the waiter a couple of times asking for a plate or heavy cutlery to keep the paper covering in place but the waiter didn't respond. When paying the bill, my husband politely asked to give feedback suggesting that in future, the paper table covering should be fastened to the table. Initially the waiter walked off mid feedback, when my husband repeated his feedback, the waiter mentioned ""if you don't like it, too bad"". It's a shame because we only wanted to give feedback and not put a damper to our experience.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Was told about this place by a friend who suggested i went, given that she knew i was saying in Soho. I wasn't disappointed. Its Good at a not too outrageous price. Thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely come back when staying in that area again.",Good,Good,
"My wife likes her morning coffee hot. The coffee was barely warm and the cups were tiny, in my opinion. I ordered Salmon Benedict, but got Eggs Benedict instead. I told waiter but did not ask to have my order corrected, since I did not want to wait. There was an unusually large number of flies in this restaurant. Staff seemed indifferent to me, but appeared to be  very friendly to their repeat customers. There were plenty of customers watching sports when we left, so this place is very popular.",Bad,Bad,Bad
We had a very nice dinner experience here.  We were staying in the area and just dropped in. Great buzz and Good.,Good,Good,
We fell upon this place being near our hotel. Food is the best of French cuisine. It is not cheap but not ridiculously expensive and God value. Try and sit in the windows and watch the world go by. It gets lively as well with really good vibe. All in all a fun place to eat.,Good,Good,
"As we were staying at the Soho Grand nearby we just fell upon this Brasserie. It was early Friday evening and the place was buzzing.


We were given a table overlooking the street which was perfect for people watching. One of my favourite pastimes! 


Service was excel an as were my escargot and my steak. Delicious! Wine list was extensive and our wine good. Do remember you're in New York, nothing is cheap. Having said that at least it was good! 


A very enjoyable evening. Tres Bon",Good,Good,Good
the place is nice and everything but I was a bit surprised that the waiter on Saturday (day time-not very busy time) added gratuity for 2 beers for 2 people. That's something that no respectable place would do.,,Good,Bad
"I love Sunday brunch here.  The atmosphere is noisy, yet wonderful. Food is excellent.  Location central to SoHo.  Great bloody marys and friendly staff.  That said, there are a few things you must do to get the most out of the experience.


1. Show up at 12-12:15.  No wait then.  After 12:15, you could be waiting an hour or more.
2. Expect poor service from the wait staff.  They will not come to your table, but will hang out at the bar.  Just know this going in.  Don't worry about it, flag down a busboy and he'll help you if you need help.  It's part of the experience, so go in knowing about it and don't let it annoy you.  You are there for the atmosphere and the food, which is exceptional.  Enjoy the food.
3. Don't show up before noon on a Sunday, or the blue laws in NYC will mean you can't be served a drink until noon, and what's brunch without a bloody mary or a glass of prosecco?",Good,Good,Good
"This is an enormously popularb restaurant and rightly so. The location and ambience are first rate, the service excellent and the food is French (mostly) and very good as well as being good value in this expensive part of town. It was graduation week at NYU which may have added to its popularity but I thoroughly recommend it and probably best to book (if youcan - we just went in on the off chance)",Good,Good,Good
"We had an excellent lunch in this very crowded and lively restaurant in Soho. The omelettes and the steak tartare were superb and so was the wine. It is quite high priced, but overall acceptable. Except for 2 things: how can you charge $20 for 2 bottles of water (still+sparkling) and how is it possible that they do not accept MasterCard nor Visa! I can pay really everywhere with these cards, but not here as Felix sticks to AmEx. That's a shame (but can be easily solved...).",Good,,
"Dropped by for a Friday night dinner and the service and food was as good as always.  Fantastic atmosphere and music which made the evening a joy.  Typically good fun guests fill the place and this is what makes Felix special.  The staff are also a joy, if not sometimes a little quick on the service!",Good,Good,Good
"Felix came highly recommended to us from a local friend. The location, proud, and the salmon omelette were impeccable. 


The not so bright spot is how they operate. We had reservations for 4, but wouldn't allow us to sit until all 4 where there. The other 2 were 30 minutes late and they gave away our reservation. We waited for 30 minutes, were seated, and having a good time, enough to order another pitcher of mimosas, but were told we couldn't and that it was time to pay out, that our table was for another reservation. A $200 tab that was on its way up was asked to leave. 


The kicker, they only accept Amex and cash, really? They however and conveniently have an ATM machine in the restaurant. 


Loved the place, but left unfulfilled.",Good,Good,Good
"Felix is well known brasserie type restaurant/bar in Soho. It draws a young and hip crowd, especially on weekends. Visit this place if you are in Soho and like a lively environment, nice bar and satisfying food.",Good,Good,
"On a beautiful day in New York.. Soho district..you come upon this lovely Cafe. The open patio with warm dark wood and inviting tables
are an attraction. The menu is French and waiters assisting speak English. With strong appetites we ordered the cheese tray, the pate with pistachios, the mussels and numerous baskets of bread.Yes and the delectable frites. All were tasted
with great gusto and the French wine helped as well.
It made a relaxing afternoon and we recommend this lovely Cafe.
Small note.. They only take American Express so cash and an ATM is at the bar.",Good,Good,
To be frank I write reviews when I am pissed off. You bet I am with Felix cafe! I was charged $30 for what I thought was tap water. I don't mind paying if I am asked and given the option between tap and bottled water. I am strong believer though that if you are fair and transparent with your customers this will translate in your food as well and Felix Cafe food is at best mediocre.,Bad,Bad,
Leaving in the Bahamas it was nice to go to New York and  have a French taste of food (beef tartare) at Felix Cafe. I recommend it,Good,Good,
"Very good bistro type food. Service was average- great place of simple meal. They're never too busy, and it's very reliably good.",Good,Good,
"The food is not extraordinary but the fact that's been around for decades and always consistent in serving casual french bistro fare in NYC is amazing. I order mostly the classics like mussels, or tartare and can resist stopping by for just a mimosa anytime.",Good,,
"noisy,but fun for lively lunch.  very tight quarters.  very crowded.  lots of locals and tourists. fast service. very very casual.  polite servers and host. food was average.
nice location.",Good,Good,Good
"A happening Soho Cafe!   Great French based food, full bar, and excellent vibe.  It is vibrant and happening without being too loud.  You can still hold a conversation.   The food is excellent although a bit over-priced for what it is.  Service is excellent and the wait was acceptable.   Only down side is they only take Am-Ex as their credit card of choice.  Plus side they have an ATM if you don't have enough cash on you.   Well worth the visit.",Good,Good,Good
"Have had mixed reviews about Felix.  Food has been pretty good when we have eaten there and food was good this last time, service is just ok...  A bit snobby.  Close to hotel so its convenient.  Just don't feel welcome when we eat there so it is usually last choice for us.",Good,Good,
"We absolutely loved this place, so much so we came back to have lunch and brunch here about 4 times. The place is run by a Brazilian/French husband and wife team and staffed with waiters who have so much energy and enthusiasm. The decor is beautiful and really, you could be in Paris once you're sitting inside. 
The food is wonderfully fresh and tasty; tuna tartare was one of my favourite appetisers and the salad with goat cheese was just the right thing to have when you want something light but full of flavour.
Burgers with chips were one of my husband's favourites and i can vouch for the chips being totally addictive.
Drinks and cocktails are also worth coming for. They know how to make a good one and also do pitchers of cocktails, perfect for groups.
We saw how buzzing the place gets on weekends after 4pm. Music was pumping and everyone looked like they were having a brilliant time. The Fussball table was moved outside and I think it wasn't long before people were dancing.
Once you've tried Balthazar (overrated), then come to Felix for a genuinely French brasserie with a wonderful vibe. I can't wait to visit again!",Good,Good,Good
"Nice music, international crowd, nice cocktails and food. If you are looking for an easy funny sunday brunch, go to Felix. Also very nice vintage decor and friendly staff. Truly reccomended! üéâüéâüéâ",Good,Good,Good
We went as a couple on our previous trip to NYC and had to visit again as it is such a great place to eat. We went with friends on New Year's Day this time. The place was full to the seams as expected. But the welcome was still friendly and the food superb. A great place to watch the world go by or chat with friends. A bonus if you are a sexy and the city fan is that it was used in one episode which is cool.,Good,Good,Good
"I always make it a point to  come to felix each time I visit NY.  Sometimes would be here 3 days in a row.  The brunch is good.   The staff, especially a beautiful, wonderful and bubbly lady named Thea, will make you feel right at home.  At night it becomes a lively bar that never ceases to amaze me.",Good,Good,Good
"Looking for somewhere nice and handy to our hotel Sheraton TriBeCa and found Felix. Had a nice chicken dish with seasonal vegetables.  Flavours were delicious with fresh quality ingredients. Cost $24 plus tax per dish. Tables on one side of resturant are close together as they often do in Europe, which when full makes your dinner less private.  Though there are plenty of tables that you could book that provide more space.",Good,Good,
Was walking past earlier read the reviews thought it was worth trying for dinner. Did not make a reservation but they fitted us in anyway very snug had to move the table to seat you. Food was good both had the chicken and mashed potatoes and vegetables. Glass of wine was a bit over the top half the cost of dinner. Would like to give brunch a try.,Good,,
"Nothing like a 'French' brunch on a sunny winters morning. With doors all around open, bar open and sun pouring in what better way to spend a couple of hours. Food as usual fantastic, service great and ambience European. A must for a Sunday morning any time of the year.",Good,Good,Good
Good. Excellent service. The only BIG problem is that they only accept American Express. It's another way to say we don't want tourists.,Good,,Good
"This is the best brunch in New York! Crazy people Good and lot of fun thanks to Andres and Thea! You can taste really good french food in this sunny soho restaurant.
Hope to coming back soon to celebrate on a Sunday Funday.",Good,Good,Good
"Last time we came here we were very impressed with the food but the service was not good.  Staying in the area again, we thought we would give it another try.  This time the service was even worse.  We sat at our table for over 30+ minutes and no one even came to give us water or acknowledged us. Waiters looked at us but walked on by.  After waiting even longer, we got up and walked out the open doors near us.  Not until we were half way down the street did a waiter run after us.  We were already on our way to David Burke kitchen.  Wont be back .  its a shame because food was pretty good last time, but waiter was rude.  but this was even worse.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Restaurant Felix is quite famous and the chef tries to keep the good reputation.  We shared a huge steak for two and some red wine.  The steak was very good, just the way we asked for.  The service was a little bit slow, however it was very crowded at that time.  The place was kind of noisy, but not above a reasonable limit.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Had brunch here on a Sunday when temperature was about 65 degrees and doors were open.  Quaint street felt like we were in a Paris bistro.  The eggs benedict were delicious, mine had spinach instead of meat and the spinach was so flavorful. Two others had it with the Canadian bacon.  The fries that came with it were crisp and perfectly done.  We had bloody mary's served in short glass and the service and hostess were great.  New favorite place!",Good,Good,Good
I just had by birthday here with a group of 10.  It was a Sunday brunch.  The menu was ideal and the staff very friendly.  Good choice of wines and when the weather is warm the resaturant opens the floor to ceiling glass doors.  Nice fun atmosphere in the place leading to a relaxed and casual atmosphere.,Good,Good,Good
"It's the perfect place for brunch with friends on Sunday, great music, mimosas and the food is pretty good, they have good selection of oysters",Good,Good,
"I wanted to give a five star but our service  was not that great. The food was excellent. Delicious, well cooked, great.  But our waiter argued with us about something The menu stayed ( a simple salad ...didn't  serve us what the menu stated even though we had a conversatation about it) and then proceeded to ignore us from that point forward. Ruined a perfect 5 star for us. We had to flag him down for everything from that point forward... From dessert to check etc.  felt totally snubbed. 
We wanted this to be our new go to place since we stay at soho grande every week...",Good,,Bad
"The Felix Caf√© has been a feature of New York for 28 years and is a magnet for expat Frenchmen. We chose pate de compagne and poule paillaut - both excellent, followed by perfect tarte tartin and creme brulee. 


The staff were quite un-Parisian in the warmth of their welcome and their attention to the customers.  A smattering of french went a long way. 


Mondays are quiet, but quite packed from Wednesday onwards,  we understand.",Good,,
We grew a habit of going to Felix right after we arrive in the city. The last time I remember having steak tartare and this time I went for pork chops. Both are very good! But I think I liked the chops better :) my husband has the steak sandwich every time and he seems to enjoy himself. Tarte tatin was also yummy if you like dessert.,Good,,
"I mean that in a nice way. Well spoken english girls with matching long blonde hair and flip flops enjoy brunch, well dressed Frenchmen, large Russian men with tiny girlfriends and Swedish brokers all mix for cocktails and banter in the evenings and at weekends.
Nice when the doors are thrown open in staff. Disdainful staff really part of the charm.",,,Good
"Some of the food looked really nice, but the salad was very plain. 
Not a vegetarian-friendly restaurant. Also very crammed and noisy. Impossible to hear someone over the noise. 
Average restaurant.",Good,Bad,
"Nice music but expensive experience to be badly treated by the bartender! We were supposed to have foie gras and champagne, among other dishes but we were so badly served that we left the restaurant after the first drink. 
I do not recommend this place, there are lots of others French brasseries and bistrots nicer than this one, specially at SoHo.
Disappointing experience!!",,Bad,Bad
This adorable restaurant makes you feel as though you are in France.  Fabulous food and people watching.  Sunday brunch delicious and fun.,Good,Good,
"Great restaurant with a nice family feeling. When you arrive you feel like you are in Paris. The service is great and they have some real classic french food on the menu. A tips is to book a table in advance, although they always solved it for us.",Good,Good,Good
"Very nice French brasserie in the heart of Soho!
Great wines and typical french brasserie food from fois gras to steak tartare. Try to get a seat next to the window - great for people watching!",Good,Good,
"Popped in for an early dinner one Tuesday evening.


The restaurant is located in the SoHo area of the city on West Broadway.


The cafe has more of a Belgian feel than French, with moules and frites being prominent on the menu.


I had a couple of Amstel light beers, six oysters, pan fried steak, fries and salad and a rum baba for dessert.


The oysters and steak were fine, although the salad constituted some limp lettuce. The rum baba was some sponge, squirty cream and a jug of white rum provided as an afterthought for the price of $12.


The beer was $10 per bottle and after including a tip, the bill was a fraction under $100.


Whilst it's an unfair comparison, I could have bought 12 meals on a recent trip to Krakow for this solitary one in Felix Cafe.",,,
"We visited here whilst staying at the Soho Grand in February as it was snowing and we didn't want to venture too far. When we walked in we were greeted in French so I replied in French and spent the rest of the night having a truly authentic French Bistro experience speaking entirely in French! 


I had the Moules which were delicious and my husband was really happy with his steak. Wine was pretty expensive but all imported wine seems to be in New York. The restaurant was full despite the snow so I can imagine that when the weather is better you'd have to book in advance.",Good,Good,Good
"I found Felix perhaps 25 years ago.  Then, SoHo was sketchy, not trendy.  So glad this early outpost has lasted as the area has become overly gentrified and pricey.  Felix was there long before the Soho Grand was built just around the corner and started to turn the area around. Believe me, it was a destination back then that I had to make friends go with me to check out.  All of them have had an excellent time. 
Here is a secret that I hate to give out, but if you do this and don't have an excellent experience, it is your fault, and I have no idea what you are looking for in a restaurant experience. 


Go on a Sunday morning when the weather is nice, arrive at least 15 minutes if not 30 before the restaurant opens, usually around 11a or 11:30a (check website for current time)


Be the first or second in line, and when Felix opens, get a table by one of the many windows where the tall French doors will be opened to the street for the day. Though I know this is a Belgian restaurant, if you love Paris, you will feel as close to being in Paris as anywhere else in NYC.


Service is almost always excellent, but on occasion, the waitstaff may have had a late night or a personable problem and what should take five minutes, takes 10.  Again, just as in any good Paris bistro.  All the more the charm, and nothing that a perfect cup of coffee or champagne can't remedy.  I love its idiosyncrasies.


The food...  It is hard for me not to get les moules frites (mussles, fries) for an indulgent Sunday breakfast/lunch.  I likely have had this 80% of the time.  When I have strayed from this favorite, I've found they serve the perfect salad ni√ßoise, salmon over lentils, and many other excellent fish dishes and specials. 


Beer and wine selection is excellent.  And having secured my perfect window seat open to the street, I'm there to watch the rest of NY wake and eventually stroll by our window on the street.  I'm usually there till 2p or 2:30p, feeling no rush by the staff to turn a table.


By the time I leave, the lines are long, the wait is long, and those coming in are antsy to get their food and quickly dash of to the newest shopping or art space in SoHo.  For me, I've had the perfect leisurely Sunday morning/early afternoon, and am then ready to stroll through SoHo knowing I've already had a perfect day, and anything else is gravy.  


So there, my secret for the perfect Sunday morning / Felix day.  I'm almost sorry I've shared this, but they've given me such pleasure doing this for so many years, I couldn't help but to. 


Again, if you're the type that goes to Paris and are put off by the occasional quirkiness of a great restaurant, keep your money and go to a 5‚òÜ upper east side.  It will be boringly perfect.  If you like Good, excellent bistro cuisine, casual atmosphere, street ambience, and can relax, take in, and enjoy life, this is my secret to you.


Wish I were there now.",Good,Good,Good
"Someone recommended this place to us and as we were being sat, we read all of the reviews.  And they were pretty spot on....


This place has very Good.  We were there for brunch and ordered the tuna tartare, the hanger steak and the chicken.  Both of us have food allergies and the kitchen was very accommodating.  That being said, the service was slow and at times the waiter was a little clich√© with the snooty ""French"" and NYC attitude.  But by the end, he had loosened up and it was an enjoyable experience.


FYI - if anyone in your party has a peanut allergy, they use peanut oil for all frying so you will get at least trace contact.  Depending on your reaction, you may have to avoid this restaurant.",Good,Good,Bad
"I have been in this restaurant in june 2015 for a dinner with some colleagues.
We found by chance and we have been attracted by its old-style look.


food is overpriced for its quality, which is nothing more than average; the same goes for the wine, although its cost might be partly justified by the fact that we are talking about stuff imported from europe.


What is really a no-go is the service: kind of bored and slow during the meal, it turned out to be annoying and aggressive by the time we got the check.
It turned out that they only accept American Express credit cards and they have been very upsetting in the way they asked us to go withdraw cash.


The area is full of restaurant and bars, no need to go in this one.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"A true SoHo institution.. A bright sunny NY morning, a window table, gentle breeze..attentive professional staff.. an Excellent Le Croque-Monsieur, Salade Verte.. a cold cleansing ale.. Happy wife (glass of chilled Ros√©) secure in the knowledge of retail bliss all around for blocks.. Ahh.. its a good life
If you're in SoHo.. get to Felix",Good,Good,Good
"We've lunched here a couple of times now, usually before catching our flight home. It has an authentic look and feel but you definitely know you are in New York and not Paris. The menu replicates the typical NY interpretation of a French brasserie and everything we've had has been good - pate, entrecote frites, confit of duck etc being our usual choices. Just be warned it gets very busy and they are cash only, the bathrooms open immediately into the restaurant also (but that seems OK in NY) ... But it's a great place to eat in the summer when the patio windows are open and they have a few tables outside.",Good,Good,
I really liked this place and the casual atmosphere. We got a table by the window wich was really nice considering the sunny weather. The staff was welcoming and polite and the food was really good. I can highly recommend it and i will definitly go back.,Good,Good,Good
"This tightly packed cafe feels like you've stepped into a small Parisian cafe. There's a tiny bar where you can order cocktails or a long list of bar food to tempt you. On the main menu, the food is everything you'd expected from a classic French Cafe. Everything is good! Coupled with impeccable service and a friendly, energetic buzz that keeps the place lively but not noisy this is the perfect spot to bring together a few friends for a catch up.",Good,Good,Good
"We had walked past this place a number of times and liked the open front terrace where diners sat. We went in for brunch and had eggs florentine - it was average. But the rip off is that they only take Amex or cash! They conveniently have an ATM in their cafe that they direct you to which (surprise surprise) they get a fee if you use it!! Having been in NY for two weeks and visited many places to eat this was the first time we had come across this although the waiter insisted it was common in the area. Ironical that just outside the cafe was an artist selling their drawings on a stall on the side of the street - I bought one and the market stall holder took any card for payment using his iPhone. Surely if a stall holder is able to accept card payments a Manhattan cafe can hence why it strikes me as a rip off.  As I said, food was average, waiter was quite rude and when we put 3 x $20 bills down for a $41 check he asked if we wanted the change! He expected a $19 tip!",Bad,,Bad
"Service not great. Food not great. Did not get the french flare but, understand that  french fries served with every meal is cheap for them.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Good, excellent food an very nice ambiance ,it's a perfect conbination for have a good times",Good,Good,Good
"We went to this restaurant 2 nights ago.
We were excited when we saw the sign ""Maitre Cuisinier de France"" for a Bistro.
First my husband ordered a Ricard (one of the most popular aperitifs in France) they
served it without any water (the basic dosage is 1/4 Ricard 3/4 water !!!).
The food was ok for a bistro (the crust of my blood sausage Tatin was burned) but nothing you'd expect from a Master Chief‚Ä¶.
The service was ok.
The restaurant was very loud.
I would have given 3 stars but for the payment : they accept only AmEx or cash !!! The hostess was very unpleasant about it .
They had an ATM in the restaurant‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. my husband preferred  to walk a block to get cash.
The maitre d' told me it was a usual practice in NY, I would not know, we are only country people from Boston where our credit cards are appreciated and we never faced this situation in NY before.
Next time we''ll be in NY we'll carry our business somewhere else.",Good,Bad,Good
"Felix is a very pleasant spot in the heart of Soho, especially if one can get a table at one of the open doors (weather permitting). We were there for late lunch and there were only 3 other tables, which may be the reason why the staff was not very attentive. It was hard to get their attention, they made mistakes and forgot orders. The chocolate souffl√© is amazing, but it took 50 minutes to arrive! I think they forgot it, since it usually takes 20 minutes to prepare something like that. We had steaks that were good. It is pricey, as one can expect it to be in Soho.",Good,Good,Good
My husband and I visited this restaurant fairly late evening and were pleased to see they were still serving food as we have passed the restaurant several times and have seen it to be busy and lively so had wanted to visit for a while.  We were seated quickly and the service was friendly throughout.  I ordered the fishcakes and my husband the steak.  The food was fine and we enjoyed our meal.  The biggest surprise came at the end of the night when we requested our cheque.  After attempting to pay by visa we were told cash or Amex only.  As we had neither there was a joke re washing dishes so we thought that our waiter was joking and expected him to bring over the credit card machine.  5minutes later he returned and it was no joke - they accept Amex or cash only.  We were then directed to the ATM directly next to the bar inside the restaurant - when withdrawing cash there is a charge.  Fine to restrict payment methods but please advise customers as they enter the restaurant.  Very disappointing.,Good,Bad,
"Nice French restaurant in the heart of SoHo. Excellent for lunch. We had super onion soup and steak tartar with a good bottle of red wine. Good and nice atmosphere.
To be recommended",Good,Good,Good
"seems this place got busier and busier,  on this trip we went twice, once for dinner (Good, delicious steak. great salads), so we went back for lunch on a super chilly sunny New York Sunday...place to crowded (good for them!), so we went out.... In a nut shell, great place for that typical French food if not in France.
We love it!",Good,Good,Good
"I have been to Felix a number of times, but yesterday was a bit special. I was walking up to Soho after the snowfall when all things were quiet and noticed that they had the English League Cup semifinal playing between Chelsea and Liverpool on a big screen. I stopped for a drink, chatted with the staff, who were all watching the game, had a good time, good banter, they were mostly Chelsea fans, and booked dinner for later. Though quieter than usual the food was outstanding. The calamari was as light as you could find with an extraordinary dipping sauce, as were the diver scallops, perfectly done on a mushroom base. The salmon on lentils was cooked perfectly, fast grill, but almost raw on the inside, excellent! This restaurant is not simply about Good, there are many restaurants in NYC that can boast that. It literally is old an French Cafe in the middle of NYC with all the character of age and not short of characters within who seem to enjoy being in a place that happens to be there place of work. The atmosphere is unbeatable.",Good,Good,Good
"This is establishment had been around for very long time.  Due to difficulty in street parking, I've never give it a try. Over the weekend, I walked around the West Broadway and decided to walk in for a quick drink. Surprising. discovered a good Sunday brunch crowd in here, it seem to be your typically Manhattan hipster and 2 tables with your babies. Food was nomore than 3 stars, the foi gras was not good at all but the bartender made up for it with fantastic cocktails. After 3pm on the Sunday, the music change to full blown house and trance, I had to make an exit quickly. Seem to be a decent spot for Sunday Brunch.",Bad,,
"I have walked past Felix Cafe for years yet never ate there until last week... what a nice neighborhood French Bistro. Great service, warm feel and Good. I will be back and only sorry I haven't been there sooner!!",Good,Good,Good
"Down in SoHo in NYC lays an island to rest from all of the shopping offered up in the neighborhood on W Broadway. Feels like you walked into a Paris caf√© and the wine list and food will rally make you feel like you are 5or 6 hours further east.
Try the steak tartar with frites and a great glass of your favorite red wine for lunch and you will soon forget how tired your feet were a few minutes before. Oh, comfort food PLUS. Try the onion soup. Done just the way they all should be. Delicious, warms the soul and oh so good!",Good,Good,
"We have been going to NYC for the last 10 years for the Thanksgiving. In one of our trips to the City we discovered Felix and ever since we have been going there for a bite to eat. The food, service and the atmosphere have been consistent,. We will be back next year in November. Happy holidays!  Keep up the good work!",Good,Good,Good
"Went to this cafe for brunch on a Sunday. Had amazing food, great music, and great wine!! Great vibe and our waiter was very friendly. The mussels are the best that I have eaten by far.",Good,Good,Good
Fab food great staff. Beautiful sunny day with light pouring into Felix. I had delicious veal with cream and mushrooms all washed down with yummy medoc. She had delicious steak with yummy bearnaise sauce. All perfect except she wasn't sure which was more scrumptious: her steak or the French waiter. Highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely return for another chocolate mousse.,Good,Good,Good
"Felix looks like an authentic French bistro complete with a small, tightly-packed bar & huge TV screen hanging precariously from the wall but has a much more lively & welcoming vibe. We visited for Saturday lunch; although it was packed & we had to wait for a table, the staff, who were rushed off their feet, couldn't have been nicer. The menu has lots of French classics, as you'd expect, a good cocktail & wine list. We ate succulent roast chicken with delicious crispy frites, well-dressed salads & a sushi-grade tuna tartar which was top class value. An inexpensive bottle of pinot noir later, we left Felix well-nourished & eager to return on our next visit to Soho.",Good,Good,Good
"Very good situated artistic Caf√©, Good, Nice service, excellent Terrace in summer, when you are in SoHo very recommended to visit.",Good,Good,Good
"Service was great, very friendly. Felix was walking distance from our hotel so we gave it a try one night. I'm happy we did. I had a great French Onion Soup.",Good,Good,Good
"We had a nice but expensive dinner for four at this Soho French Bistro. Crowded but lively, service was fast if not attentive. The food was good, especially the risotto. The mussels were good, but not the best I've had. All in all a lovely evening, but then the bill came and she said American Express or cash. Well, it took every dollar we had. So beware! But if you have the cash, its fun.",,Good,Good
"Walking around the Soho in NYC we found this great french restaurant. I had one of best meats ever! Everything was so good, but prices are expensive.",,Good,
"Charming bistro.  Had a late breakfast, with the sun shining through open doors.  Excellent ham & gruyere cheese omelet  with salad and amazing french fries - a taste sensation.  Service was charming.  My guest enjoyed the coffee with warm milk....overall experience was delightful.",Good,Good,Good
What an incredible place!  The chef continues to add to the menu and the food he puts out is spectacular! True french cuisine full of flavor and creativity.  My husband and I frequent this place whenever we are in the city and are truly surprised every time by the superb food that is served here. So good!,Good,Good,
"I've often wished there was section on Trip Advisor for ""good"" which I feel is better than ""average"" and obviously a step below ""very good."" We both had burgers for a late lunch and a glass of wine. Burgers were fine; mine came with the bun which I had asked not to have. Service was fine; the fellow didn't appear overly engaged. Perfect spot for people watching and with the booming tourist trade in the area. Atmosphere is fun and relaxed and for our late afternoon visit, it was super to not need a reservation. Felix is ""fine."" I'd certainly order the burger again.",Good,Good,Good
"High quality French bistro style cuisine. We enjoyed the charcuterie plate, bread, and entrees. The coffee and latte were the one area for improvement.",Good,,
"We went for a late lunch. Had the risotto of the day, with shrimps, artichoke hearts and mushrooms which was outstanding. The ham sandwich was also great. The salad with tomato and burrata, and the one with crab and palm hearts were very good too. Even the cheese macaroni were very good. The place, on a warm sunny afternoon with all the window doors open invited to stay for a long and relaxed lunch.",Good,Good,
"We stopped here for lunch after a morning of shopping.  I had a salad with crab, avocado and artichoke.  Absolutely amazing!  Was a busy place, but would absolutely make the trip back next time I am in NY.",Good,,
"I was more than disappointed when my husband, son and I dined at Felix this evening. We were recommended by our hosts from our accommodation and so we were eagerly anticipating a beautiful French meal.
When we arrived the snobby hostess completely ignored me while we stood waiting to be seated. Another patron stepped in front of me and she chose to seat him first. When she came back I explained that I was looking for a table for 3. Once seated, it took ten minutes to receive bread and water.
I enjoy steak tartare and so ordered this. I often choose this and rarely have problems. This version was tasty enough but very chewy with multiple large pieces of gristle throughout. I told the waiter when he collected the plate about it and some other waiter came to try to defend the dish. I have worked in hospitality myself and have prepared steak tartare at the table for customers. There is no other way to say it but that it was sub-quality meat. I was not looking for a discount or a free dessert as offered. I merely wanted to point out that it was the worst steak tartare I'd ever ordered. Even the German restaurant in TriBeCa can pull off a better one than your restaurant.
Overall this was the most appalling restaurant experience we've had in NYC in the last month that we've been here.
Oh, and AMEX only? What's with that???",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had brunch--Benedict Florentine and Benedict Saumon with champagne based beverages. The eggs were done just right as were the drinks. Staff was attentive to requests. Situated on a corner, the restaurant has pleasant views of the street.",Good,Good,Good
"Stumbled across this at Noon on Broadway/Canal. Open area type cafe. Surprising to me was that he asked if I had a reservation, which I did not, but said I was going to have one drink at the bar (very small bar). Fairly busy at first, but little did I realize that the World Cup game was about to start - Colombia vs Greece, and I was in the middle of a gaggle of South Americans!! It got crowded in a hurry, and the futbol vibe was buzzing, standing room only! I texted the wife and told her to get here! We enjoyed the game, excitement. fans, dancing, and celebration! The food looked and smelled great. We did not eat, but will return to do so, next time.",Good,Good,
"We were fortunate to get a table in the window, half in and half out of the restaurant. Sunny, breezy day, GREAT FOOD and people watching to die for. Service very good and the butterflied berkshire porkchop, was one of the best I have ever eaten.  And save room for dessert!!",Good,Good,Good
"The best French restaurant! Love the atmosphere, love the food!!!! The service was great! 
There is also a bar area where a lot of people just having drinks, talking or watching a game on a huge TV. My husband and I love to go there for a romantic dinner, but we also take our kids with us sometimes and they also enjoy the food there very much!",Good,Good,Good
No trip to New York is complete without a trip to NYC.  The place is always buzzing but always manage to get a table. Lovely when the sun is shining as all the doors are opened so it's like eating on a terrace. The food is very authentic French (and I live in France). The roast chicken at lunch is divine! Good wine list. Have always found service to be excellent especially considering the size of the restaurant.  It's a total gem.  Not cheap by any standards but it is New York and very good quality.  Can't wait to go back on my next trip.,Good,Good,
I went to Felix for saturday brunch with my girlfriend and a friend. We had a good time and ate delicious.,Good,Good,
"Just had an early dinner. The location is fabulous, the restaurant is beautiful.
The service is appalling. I ordered a confit de canard which was dry and tough. I asked for another dish- the risotto of the day which looked very good but tasted like nothing. The only bad restaurant in a wonderful 5 day trip.",Bad,Good,Bad
"I went with 4 girl friends on sunday. We were looking forward to a brunch experience in a french restaurant and it completely fill our expectation.
the service was great and super fast.
I've been told to go on sundays afternoon because its full of people drinking and having fun but I couldn't manage to make the time.",,Good,Good
"We visted Felix Cafe on a Saturday evening to celebrate an engagement. Although crowded we were immediately escorted to our table wihout waiting. The cafe was noisy with conversation and music. But it was a good noise, families and friends enjoying each others company with laughter and conversation. Our server, I regret not getting her name, may have been an owner. If she was not, she certainly behaved as if she were and was friendly and solicitous with menu and wine recommendations. Service was prompt and efficient without being rushed and the dinner was marvelous.  Restaurants are expensive in NYC but real value is more important. We will definitely return.",,Good,Good
Bouillabaisse was mussels and other shellfish. Nothing you would recognise in Marseille. Service was good. Probably will not return. OK just not special.,Bad,,Good
"After a long cold New England winter we arrived at Felix on a Saturday afternoon at 5:00 to find the large doors open to the street and fresh spring air. The place was full of life and a very fun atmosphere. We sat at the bar and had a little early dinner, all the while watching the world go by in and out of the restaurant. Very European feel with soccer ,not basketball, on the TV. Affordable with great food.",Good,Good,
"Early Friday evening. bar area busy and a good ambiance observed. Most of the dinner tables occupied so a healthy atmosphere overall. Waiter offered explanation of specials but we stuck to menu. No water offered. Starters and main course were good, though not spectacular. The longer our dining experience became, the less friendly the staff were. Looked very much like a demarcation zone between the servers - one will not enter into another area, so we had to wait some time for our waiter to be available for more drinks and the bill, despite other waiters serving nearby tables. Same with the servers - no mans land in some areas. Good wine list and selection of beer but is one supposed to drink Kronenbourg 1664 from a wine glass?  Regret that I had to as no other glass provided. 


Overall, nothing to write home about though with most restaurants in Paris, the food is fine, but the attitude and courtesy from the waiting staff leaves much to be desired. If you accept this as being part of the French eating experience, then you won't be disappointed.",Good,Good,Bad
"The food is great, very typical French cuisine. Well executed. Very nice restaurant with the ""bistro"" style. I just didn't like the too French attitude in some of the staff members. Other than that good place for French food",Good,Good,Bad
"Was recommended as a nice casul French/ Brazillian eatery, but turned out to be an amazing french bistro.  The food was amazing and the ambiences equally nice.  Make sure you have an American Express as that is all they accept.",Good,Good,
"My husband and I were passing through New York for the day and we had not cleared our Amex cards to be used in the States.  (We usually use Visa/Mastercard).  Neither did we have the $163 cash, which was the bill for two starters, two mains and two glasses of wine.  When we asked directions to the nearest ATM to draw cash, the management asked for our credit card and ID while we were to walk to the ATM.  These were handed over.  We also gave them the name of our hotel (which was a block away). My wife was then blocked from leaving the restaurant with me.   Of course this did not go down well!   Both of us then left to walk the two blocks to the ATM to draw cash.   On our return a few minutes later the cops were waiting for us!!! Unbelievable.  I didn't know people could be so untrusting.  Once we explained our story the sergeant said to us ""I bet you won't be eating there again"".  Well, he was right!  Left a very bad taste in our mouths.",,Bad,Bad
"Had a great brunch.  Vibrant with a que forming, felt we arrived at the right time.  So yes there is only one loo, but we did not come for the bathrooms and my steak was beautiful.  Quite a few French speakers, attentive and friendly staff.",Good,Good,Good
"Fabulous Soho location with great large windows which are ideal for spring or fall brunches!  Great place to meet friends, small or large groups.",,Good,
"Always Good, french style bistro with Good and always reliable food.
woooden table, a bit close together but that is part of the 'ambiance'.
The restaurant/cafe is on a corner in a nice area in Soho.",Good,Good,Good
"Put our name in with the host, and told it would be 45 minutes.  Gave us time for a quick browse round Soho before we went back for late lunch.  Host and server were fantastic.  Got a seat on the outside.  Food decent and well priced.  Fun, hectic atmosphere.  Would go again!",Good,Good,Good
"We were recently staying at The James - just a block away...so we had several meals at this lovely restaurant in Soho. With all of the doors open...on several pretty days...it felt like we were in Paris. Food was tasty, good wine selection. Just a really fun vibe ...try the lamb sandwhich...so good that we had it twice! Great option if you are in Soho.",Good,Good,
I love Felix. This is one of my favorite restaurants in New York. Food is great and service is awesome!,Good,Good,Good
"After a few hours exploring SoHo we looked for a bar to put up our feet and have a dinkie. Passing Felix for the second time we remarked again how lovely it looked with its French windows open wide and the white linen tables flapping in the summer breeze. Probably too good just for a drink, but we asked and they said yes. We even got a window table. My partner had a cocktail, I had a glass of what turned out to be a really nice Sauvignon blanc. We lazily sat there thinking ""Life is good"" - too good to leave it seems, for we were soon ordering more drinks. This time I switched to a Sancerre (I know, I know; I shouldn't but I did. And it was excellent). Yes, service was a little ""amateurish"", but that was because the staff were over-anxious to be helpful. Definitely a fault in the right direction and one that many restaurants could copy with benefit to all. 
The decor was spot-on. Wall hangings, great old mirror, terrazzo flooring, all conspired to give one the feeling of a real French bistro. No frills or fancies but just the right atmosphere. We were so taken with the place that we decided to stay on and have something light to eat. My other half had the Salade de ch√®vre chaud, which he was very happy with. I went for the P√¢t√© de campagne. This was the real thing! A little on the rough side, as it should be. With it a glass of a humble Vin de pays from H√©rault (Grenache, Syrah, Tempranillo) which was a winner. All reasonably priced. This place is definitely on our list for our next visit to NY.",Good,Good,Good
"Nice interior and tables on the streets, these are only positives sides I can find in this restaurant. Overpriced food to its quality and the service you can get. The waiters are definitely not in the right place, as the restaurant tries to aspire to something, which is at upper level. Amazingly only cash or AMEX accepted. Do not recommend if you look for Good.",Bad,Good,Bad
"My friend and I stopped in at Felix Cafe for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon.  We ordered salads and a glass of wine.  The bread plate was ok, nothing special.  She also ordered a bottle of sparkling mineral water and coffee.  Our salads were good and I have no complaints about the restaurant.  the wait staff were nice and not overbearing.  The view to the street was fun but it was a bit noisy.  I'm not sure if I'd go back.  It was an ok restaurant.",Good,Good,Good
"This Soho restaurant has been around for many years and draws a solid crowd of Euro types with its French/Brazilian inspired menu. You will see some fashion-looking types as well, just don't confuse them with the real thing.
We were here on a very hot summer night and this place had no air conditioning. The solitary cell-like restroom stunk. The profiteroles got soggy and tasteless very quickly.
I am all for institutions, but c'mon now. Time to upgrade and join the 21st century.",,Bad,
"It was hot and we were tired.  It was too early for dinner, but we felt like a snack of some sort, and something to drink (in my case a Pastis).  We happened upon Felix in SoHo, and they had exactly what we wanted: Oysters on the half shell, a bread and cheese plate, cold beer and wine, and of course Pastis (and a generous pouring at that).  It was a bit expensive (but hey, this is New York after all) but all in all quite worth it.  My only shock was that when I tried to pay with credit card, they told us that the only one they accepted was American Express.  This was a surprise to me, because it is the contrary of what one usually finds in restaurants, but in any case cash also works just fine.   But be forewarned: you need one or the other.",Good,Good,
"We were there for lunch, close to 3pm, the place was buzzing!
We are not drinkers, the food was delicious, servers not even looking at you...
Charming building with antique features and great atmosphere!",Good,Good,Bad
"I've certainly had very good French Toast before, but Felix's is other-wordly. The perfect balance of egg and brioche with just a hint of coconut. BTW, it also has a great cup of coffee.",Good,,
"We choose this place based on menu and scene. The food was good but the service terrible. We were during happy hours time  and planning to stay for dinner. 
We have to wait for a long time to have refills of water, change course . The coffee was served after we ate all desserts and several reminders to waiters. 
At the end ,when we need to pay a bill , the 18%gratitude was included in the bill. When we ready to pay the we got acknowledged that place accepts only American Express credit card or only cash which is weirded for restuarnat business.
Please be carefull with this and have plenty of cash when you will plan to visit the place.",Good,Good,Bad
But the service and food is no more than so-so.  Toilets are dreadful.  Cash and Amex only and the ATM will give $120 at a time only which had my bank freeze the card for unusual activity (multiple withdrawals to pay the bill...),,Bad,
"Great party drinking atmosphere! My girlfriends and I had a fabulous fun time on Memorial Day. Food was average, nothing to brag over. The sangria was yummy, music and atmosphere were great. Servers were nice, but did not do anything overly amazing. This place ONLY takes Amex or Cash - it will be a very big surprise if you don't know (like us). 


Also the girls washroom was broken when we went, there was no sign or anything, so that too was a surprise when you lifted the toilet. The guys bathroom was clean however :)",,Good,Good
There are no bookings here so be prepared to wait at the bar! The atmosphere is excellent and the music is always pumping what ever time of the day! Steak frites is the thing to go for!,Good,Good,
"On a sunday, starting at 2 PM this is the place for party!!! You just need to check it out!
In soho...",,Good,
"There are a number of things to be said about Felix, f instance that it's got the looks of a French cafe, or that the foie gras was very good. And there's a lot to be said on the south side of OK.  It's expensive, considering all, it' noisy, above all the staff is insecure and bordering on amateurish. But for a light plate in a place that makes you look good, not too bad. 
Problem is; you find better options further south. Just cross Canal St and you're practically safe.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Food was good but a bit expensive for the value - accompanying salads were tasty but could have done without the fries - perhaps would not have minded if they had be hand cut, but they were out of a bag. AMEX or cash are all they accept, which can be a bit of surprise if you don't know. Servers, pleasant but not warm.",,,
"A French bistro with a really delicious menu. The ‚ÄòSteak to Share‚Äô looked amazing but I went for the chicken, salad and frites. Yum!!


A great atmosphere, busy and full with people enjoying themselves, friendly staff and even better we had a window seat so could watch the world go by as we ate.


Only issue is they don‚Äôt take card payments. But they do have an ATM in the corner of the restaurant so easy enough to pay by cash.",Good,Good,Good
"Soho is a very nice and upcoming area in New York, with lots and lots of great restaurants. However, if you happen to get close to Canal Street, on Broadway, try a bouillabaisse here. The cook is french, the food is great and service is french, too. On a hot summer day, you may even feel like you are in Southern France. Promi. Vraiment.",Good,Good,Good
"Had a very nice roasted poulet & frite dinner with a bottle of wine and the atmosphere makes up for much of the enjoyment. If you squint and shake your head you can imaging yourself in a parisian bistro. The place is worn and noisy and I liked that. The service was friendly and yes, they DO only take AE or cash so be ready. I'd go again, it is what it is and I enjoy it for that.",Good,Good,Good
"The happy hour included oysters for a dollar. I ordered 6 but only four were consistent. The other two were firmness and they unshaped just by touching with the fork. 


The chef doesn't know how to choose the right meat for a steak nor even know how to cut it. The choice of the steak is cheap but sold for 8 times more the real value. After my complain the waiter offered me a better steak choice by pointing to the angus steak on the menu. The angus steak was exactly the same as the previous one but this time, it was cut in small pieces and covered with a brown sauce to hide the fake angus steak.


Every time I need a waiter since I first ordered my dinner, it was very hard to have a waiter available at my table and I had always turn around to look for him and call him because he liked to talk to the bartender instead paying attention at his two tables. 


Finally, I asked for my check and gave the waiter my credit card and he said that they accept only American Express or cash, since I had my platinum visa card. 


Since I first entered in that ""place"" I thought about the nationality of the owner if he was Brazilian since outdoor there are visible Brazilian flags on top of the Felix sign. When I asked the hostess she informed me that the menu is French because the ""rest..."" owner is French. It was already ambiguous since the beginning. I was hungry and I didn't want to disappoint my friend since he didn't have much time to select another dining place so that, unfortunately I decided to stay.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had a nice meal, the drinks were expensive. When the bill arrived we were told that they only excepted cash or American Express. We were directed to an ATM they had in the resturant which unsurprisingly charged for cash withdrawals. Be aware. 
We were asked to pay a gratuity even though the menu stated this was extra for parties over six.",Good,,
"I keep going back.  My daughter lives in NYC, and for the food and the atmosphere, I always find my way to Felix.  


I love the Salade Niciose with the seared tuna, and I've also enjoyed the canned tuna choice.  The latter is a big step above your grocery store selections (think specialty store), but the seared tuna is my favorite.  Though always recognizable, the salad's ingredients change from time to time, and it's always wonderful.  I travel often travel to France, and Felix's Salade Niciose is still my favorite.  The Steak Frites is a close second favorite.  Felix's offers good Provence Roses that are very different from the American blended varieties, and that's my wine of choice.  I love the atmosphere, especially in the warm weather when the floor to ceiling doors are open and the space becomes an outdoor dining room.  The staff has always been gracious, and I'll be back the next time I'm in New York.


BTW, I always enjoy seeing the restaurant on TV and in film.  It was a setting in Adam Chandler's ""Big Daddy"" (the famous father/son scene outside a restaurant)  and its the scene in an Alec Baldwin Cap One commercial.  It's not that I'm star struck...it's  just that, when I see these images, I wish I was there.",Good,Good,Good
"This place has very poor ratings on Yelp, check it out.  We had a horrible rude experience there and the food is substandard.  Trust me.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The hotel we stayed at gave us this restaurant's name. Quick walk. Service was very slow, people received their food before us, even though we ordered before. The food was good.  When we went to pay- only take American Express.  Oops, thank goodness we had some cash..
There were tables that were somewhat outside, and people did smoke at them. Not much fun when you are trying to eat. Could be a great place with better attention to service.",Good,Bad,Bad
we had a great couple of nights have $1 oysters and champagne before we headed out to dinner with the kids,,,
Good and good place to watch people. Bruch was very nicre and having a table  in theireopen window space is great,Good,Good,
"It has ambient music, open doors to the street and Good. This french casual restaurant is a fam of soccer, so it is the right spot for live soccer.",Good,Good,
"It is a lovely place, but the service was poor. Kind, but very very slow",,Good,Bad
"Good, nice ambiance, cool people at any time during the day. Nice for a full meal or just for a quick snack.",Good,Good,
"The vibe here on a sunny Sunday in May was great. The place was packed and buzzing, with open french windows giving street-side tables a great view. Although we had reserved a table we were not seated until the final person in our party arrived - this seems to be the policy at NY restaurants - and thus had to wait quite a long while for a table. The hostess however was very understanding and sent us a round of drinks for our patience. Other than that, the service was fine, not particularly friendly. The food was good, but nothing spectacular.",Good,Good,Good
"WORST CAIPIRINHA EVER, I mean, probably... worst capipirinha in the whole world. If I were Brazilian I would probably file a lawsuit against them for missuing that word!.
Apart from that... the music is good and the vibe on Sundays afternoons is great... but please, for God's sake... discontinue that drink from the list... or make it good!!",Bad,Good,
"Great place to watch the soccer finals, grab a le burger and mojitos with Friends!",Good,Good,
"Trendy places come and go, but Felix remains. Best French onion soup around.",Good,Good,
"I am still not certain what kind of food was served. Full disclosure, we really wanted to come in because it looked cool from the street and decided to sit at the bar while we looked at the menu. We weren't offered any help by the bartender and pretty much just took a guess on what would be good to sample. We settled on some wine and a cheese plate. He pretty much acted like he didn't want to be there and it showed. The cheese plate didn't match the wine selection and at the best I would have hoped he would have given some detail about what it included.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The atmosphere was amazing, the location is great and the food was very tasty!",Good,Good,
"Nice restaurant for either couples or family.  A little noisy but not bad, good location if you are shopping in SOHO>",,Good,
"Well, let's go with the good stuff first!  This place had a vibe, if that's a plus and a certain French cafe/hangout/place to be feel that made it kind of upbeat and fun.  And so.........that's where the good stuff ends, mostly.  We had a reservation and when we got there the place was jumping, but they kind of curtly greeted us and then everyone was kind of constantly being shoved aside by semi rude, semi obnoxious people trying to set up/smash/mush tables into an already crowded place. Truly you often wondered, Am I going to be beheaded by a table being flown in or smashed by a chair.


After we got seated, a pleasant waiter/Coolio/I think I'm a model guy came over and bascially asked us what we wanted to eat, we ordered and when the food came, the funniest thing was, the tables are tiny and the plates they serve the food on...are HUGE!!! How bizarre.  There wasn't enough room on the table...for the FOOD!!! Hmmm!  Any thought go into this.  The food was your sort of generic French cafe food, nothing great, nothing terrible, just sort of in the middle.


Here's the best part.  The music was annoyingly loud when we got in.  It got almost deafening by the time we left.  We were literally screaming to hear each other.  It was like what they're doing with the commercials now.  It was so ridiculous, we decided to forgo coffee and desert so we wouldn't lose our hearing.  And no, we are not old, we're plenty young to enjoy a good time, this was just well, silly!",,Bad,Bad
"We had just been to the 911 Memorial and wanted to see some of the SOHO area of the city.  While there we found a small French Bistro for our early dinner.  Since it was early the restaurant was neither crowded nor noisy.  We fully had a delightful evening meal.  We started with the Onion Soup $11, and for the main course I had the Coq Au Vin $24 and my spouse ate light with the salad Frisee $12.  The food was well prepared and presented.  Service was also good.  When back in SOHO area we would go back.",Good,Good,Good
"Christmas Day, just stopped in for a drink in the afternoon.  However, we made to feel welcome at a table.  M
No hurry to order food or another drink.  Energetic but cool vibe. M",,Good,Good
"My experience of the last few years is that this place is always welcoming. U come once a year. Yesterday my meal was not as good as last years, service was not as good, and they only accept Amex or cash! Come on it's the 21 st century",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The salad that started off the meal was delicious and we thought we must have found a great place, but when the main courses arrived it was a big disappointment. I ordered the mussels and they were mealy and very fishy. I didn't end up eating more than a few before I threw in the towel and pushed them away. My husband ordered a steak and it was tough and dry even when ordered medium rare. The waiter was so inexperienced he didn't even notice that neither my husband nor I ate much of our meal and didn't bother to ask why. We did voice our opinions on the fare with the manager and he half heartedly listened and then thanked us for coming in. Somehow I don't think he got it that we weren't nearly as happy about coming in as he was.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The food is always very good: classic French! Have a Ca√Æpiroska and do some people watching! In the Summer, sit out on the makeshift terrasse.... The ambiance is always fun and happening!!!",Good,Good,
"This was the first time I had ever eaten a meal at a French restaurant. And I really enjoyed this lovely place! My cousin and easily made reservations online and even though we were 15 minutes late we were still seated quickly. We say in a patio booth that was outside and enjoyed looking over soho as we ordered our meals. We 
both ordered from the brunch/breakfast menu and loved our meals! although the meals did not take long to come out they tasted like there had been a great deal of preparation to the recipes so it was just right! I really enjoyed the space as well as the art work. The only reason I wouldnt frequent Felix's is because the music is very loud inside the building and with the colder months coming along I don't see myself sitting outdoors where it is quiter. All in all an absolutely delightful experience!!",Good,Good,
"Nice service, efficient, Good but miss that little extra that makes the difference and the ""petit plus"". French menus and cuisine but not really French mood and flavor.
But it was my second night in NYC and I was a little bit tired. Prefer Pastis (but not the same price...)",Good,,Good
"While some criticize the Felix, we absolutely love the food, service, and atmosphere.  The day was lovely, and the open-air seating was ideal.  It was a wonderful experience.",Good,Good,Good
"Busy cafe in Soho with a young casual crowd. Salads, eggs and ""bistro"" food. steak tartar, confit de canard etc. The food arrived too fast to have been prepared with any thought, milking cappuccino, sickly tarte tartin. $40 dollars a head. Dirty toilets - and as  Anthony Bourdain's ‚ÄúKitchen Confidential‚Äù reminds us - if the toilet's are like that what does it say about the kitchen. Not on my list for a repeat visit",,Bad,
Amazing brunch. Mimosas and steak and fritts do not get any better. You will be sitting on top of the people next to you... But it's worth it! Plan for a morning adventure and prepare to be stuffed when you leave!,Good,Good,
"This place is cute and that is all that it has going for it. The service is slow and extremely rude and the drinks are overpriced. I only had the shrimp cocktail to eat and that wasn't fresh. They also lie... the menu claims they only add a gratuity on parties of 6 or more but they added a $50 gratuity to my bill and there were 4 of us. 
Good tip = Good. right? Not to them. The waiter actually followed us into the street and yelled at us that we didn't leave a good enough tip. He then threatened us... nice. Thank you. Never going back.",Bad,Bad,Bad
This little restaurant on the corner of W Broadway and Grand St is a gem! We had many a refreshment and wonderful appetizer's while sitting at the bar. Claudio is a fantastic bartender and made our visit unforgettable. We will return again!,Good,Good,Good
"Felix is a unique bistro with an eclectic, European flare.  The restaurant is especially delightful when temperatures are warm and the doors are opened.  The doors are almost floor to ceiling on two sides of the restaurant, and when open, the entire room becomes an airy, covered cafe.


My favorite meals have included the Salade Nicoise (both versions!),  Steak Frites and Steak Tartar.  Brunch offerings, especially the Eggs Benedict, are also wonderful.


Felix is a small restaurant  that seems to be especially popular with locals and European travelers.  The only time that I been to Felix when it was not crowded was in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday.  Expect to wait during regular meal times and on weekends, but it's worth it.  You are in the heart of Soho...take advantage of the wait and soak in  the atmosphere!


Note:  Felix took reservations the last time I was there for a party of seven.  I have not been able to get reservations for a smaller party, but give them a call.",Good,Good,
"We managed to get a last inute table after being badly let down by Mr Chow on E57th.  The food was to a high standard, the service was impeccable and the music was good too.  Not enough variety on the manu but on the whole a place I'd recommend.",Good,Good,Good

They said it was Spanish ham. It was not. I am Spanish.",Bad,,
"The worst restaurant i have been ever in my life.
The food was terrible and extremely expensive.
Something very strange goes on there‚Ä¶
At the end they came three people including the manager over my head for the bill they have put the gratuity by themselves 20% without asking me and asking me to pay in cash cause the price will be different.
They try to sell you dishes of the day with white truffle and the half of the dishes of the menu they dont have them!!!! please  avoid to go at this place and tell it to everybody.
Im 1000% sure that this restaurant will close very soon!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
A shame. It should be closed. Terrible food & senselessly expensive. Very Bad. Dishes missing from the menu. Completely touristy. I doubt there is a real chef in the kitchen. To be forgotten together with the lost money. A robbery.,Bad,Bad,
"We found this restaurant and decided to have late lunch. The service was impeccable,  the food we ordered was very nice but the desserts were sublime: simple, well presented and taste exquisite accompanied by a cup of espresso‚Ä¶ We asked the restaurant manager and he said that they were home made by their chef in the morning.",Good,Good,Good
Worst restaurant ever!!! We ordered the specials and weren‚Äôt told the price. We ordered a plate of spaghetti with melted cheese and a few truffles (the special for the night) and were being charged $200 per plate at the end of the evening! When they tried to adjust the price we were literally negotiating with the servers and the manager never showed up. Overall it was the most unpleasant experience!,Bad,Bad,Bad
"HORRIBLE! Taste worse than a school lunch! I liken it to bad airplane food and you pay about the same as a round trip airline ticket to boot! My husband and I had 2 plates of pasta, 1 salad, 1 desert, 1 water and 1 coffee for a total of $327! Please go anywhere else for pasta and save the money!",Bad,Bad,
"This restaurant is horribly overrated and overpriced. Not only they didn‚Äôt mention that the ‚Äúspecial menu‚Äùwhich pasta with truffles  would be almost 200usd. They even charged us 28% for the tip. Our Valentines lunch costs 750usd for 3 people! That‚Äôs  me, my husband and 5yrs old daughter. Ridiculous!!!! 


Never ever come to this restaurant unless you want to burn your money. Not even a penny worth for this.",Bad,Bad,
"Yes, is as good as any Italian food I have ever had and may be better. Incredible menu, amazing food, incredible ambience, excellent location, indoor and outdoor seating‚Ä¶ Incredible service just absolute perfection. This will be on our list of places to go every time we come back to New York.",Good,Good,Good
"AVOID AVOID AVOID
These people are thieves!!!!!!!!!


We were  for a lunch  there. 
Ordered 2 dishes of ravioli  , mozzarella salad and 2 glasses California white wine. They charged us. 298$ !!!!!!! 


Service was bad! They try to sell you champagne, cocktails and truffle  dishes  and they insist all the time!‚Äù Over and over!!!!


My husband wanted to pay with credit card but the tip was cash‚Ä¶.. the waiter did not allowe us to do that !!!! He took the mashing away and told us that the tip must be at least 60$ -90 $
It was such an awkward situation!!!!!!


I repeat:
We paid 360$ in total for  2 ravioli , 1 mozzarella and 2 glasses white wine!!!!!!!!


Food was average",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Stopped by after shopping, about 3pm on a Friday afternoon. Just had drinks ( and compliments skinny bread sticks). Drinks were good, and service attentive. All I can say about the food is a couple of tables of folks were having desserts, and were raving about it. Definitely would stop there again.",Good,Good,Good
"Fried calamari disgusted! Really.
Caesar Salad NO Caesar dressing!
Mapping the floor while we and others are eating? Do you really like to smell the chemicals? 
Apparently the owner‚Äôs don‚Äôt care and it‚Äôs obvious from the tables & stained chairs. 
Well, we would have had better food on a street cart that this dumb. 
First & Last time & I‚Äôm doing a favor!!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"My favorite wife and I were strolling towards the museum on the UES and stopped here for a drink. Being a local from New York City, always saw this place while zooming by in a cab, but this time we had the pleasure of stopping on a Saturday afternoon for a drink‚Ä¶and use the bathroom. Turns out this is a Venetian restaurant so I had to have an Aperal spritz! It was fantastic, pricy but fantastic. So next time you‚Äôre on Madison Avenue, walking up to the museum, stop here enjoy a cocktail and the experience of walking through museum for hours and hours might make it a little more pleasant. For you movie buffs, Three days of Condor, and the French Connection were filmed in this neighborhood. I recommend the Aperol spritz.",Good,Good,
"Totally overrated. Brutal prices for a below average food.
Nothing in the restaurant is wow or unique that justify those prices. 
Big mistake.",Bad,Bad,
"This place really hace a high standard of excellence and elegance. Located in one of the most sophisticated areas of NYC, Nello has the virtue of delivering any high expectation with its highly referenced Italian food and very sophisticated ambiance. A bit pricy in my opinion, but definitely a place to enjoy when visiting NYC.",Good,Good,
"After decades of Goods at Nello under Mr. Balan's prior ownership, Nello's should be renamed ""Hell No"". Party of 3 well dressed women: the wait captain seemed annoyed we wanted to linger over cocktails before ordering, was miffed we weren't interested in the pricey truffle options, and argued with the table's host about the calamari dish that she ordered which seemed to arrive incorrect according to the customer. Wait captain aggressively propped an open menu in front of her and in a loud voice berated the customer about what she had ordered suggesting she didn't know what she was talking about. Host, in turn, dubbed wait captain ""Rude"" and ""Abrupt"" in a voice loud enough he got the message.  Said Captain stalked off and disappeared until he presented the billing machine tableside to the host and then stood there glaring not letting go of the machine. The meal and experience were ruined by his poor demeanor. Note to staff: Customers are the reason a restaurant exists!  Entire horrible experience squarely the fault of Nello personnel who are seemingly bent on upselling, rushing the diners, and steering menu choices for $$$. Food was, in a word, ""Gross"".  Wine prices are revoltingly high. Ordinary Sta. Margherita Pinot Grigio is $130 per bottle and $29 per glass, which represents roughly a nine fold mark-up. Nello's has sunk to its lowest--a truly terrible experience you cannot afford to endure, in more ways than just the beating your wallet will take - undeservedly. However, if you like to sit down for a high priced, rushed dinner and be abused by surly, cocky waitstaff, Nello's is for you.  For us it will be ""Hell No"" Nello.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The first 6 entrees we ordered at 8:30 pm were sold out: no chicken, artichokes, scallops, sea bass, striped bass and  lobster. This is on a Saturday night.  Very surprised and slightly disappointed.  And what‚Äôs with the huge red stuffed bears? One thing for Valentine‚Äôs Day, but frankly odd for an upscale restaurant.",,Bad,
"Overpriced. You must go to another restaurant nearby paying 50% less. You just pay for the place, the pasta is ‚ÄúOK‚Äù but not the best in town. Don‚Äôt waist your time and money.",Bad,Bad,
"We go to Nello every time we're in NYC.  It's always a good meal, atmosphere is great and it's in a great location! I love the Fegatini!  People that think this menu is too expensive must not get out much! Sorry!",Good,Good,
"We order pasta with Truffle and they didn‚Äôt starved the Truffle  in the table and it was totally not fresh, we also ask for  seabas and it was very greasy. 
The price outstanding , I thefinilly won‚Äôt be going back.",Bad,Bad,
The best way to describe the vibe eating here was like being at an used car dealership. The $59 octopus salad was delicious,Good,Bad,
When you see such high prices in the menu your expectation level also goes up! Unfortunately Nello‚Äôs food does not meet their price tag. It is nice and averages dishes that does not wow you. I will not be back as there are way taster Italian places in NYC.,Bad,Bad,
Waiters never even bother to say thanks for a 20% tip on an outrageous price. Food was ok but the attitude unacceptable. Will not return and would not recommend. Many other better choices where your experience will be more pleasant.,Good,Bad,Bad
"I have been going to Nello for 10+ years. The food and scene used to be top notch. 


The fact you can now get a last minute reservation via Opentable on a friday night says everything. 


Now it is just a very very average and very expensive italian. So many better places to dine at these days. Go elsewhere ...you'll have better food, better service and more money left in your wallet !",Bad,Bad,Bad
We have been coming to nello for 20 yrs and always have a lovely experience. We love the staff and the food is amazing. It's definitely expensive but we always feel it was worth it. Feels like there are many regulars dining at nello which is a nice break from all the more tourist filled restaurants. The ambiance is special too. I love the bears.,Good,Good,Good
"This place is a terrible restaurant, with mediocre food and expensive. Do not recommend. Be careful when ordering drinks off charts",Bad,Bad,
"Overpriced, snooty maitre d‚Äô, small portions, slightly above average Italian food.
Be careful when paying by credit card. They expect at least a 20% tip on the total. The swipe machine shows the total only, not the subtotal. So customer is tipping on the tax too!",Bad,Bad,
"The food and setting are all very good.  The pasta is house made.  Fettuccini is supple and taste.  There is a large selection of dishes to choose from,  Desserts also looked good, but we did not partake.  The restaurant is beautiful with beautiful people.


Prices are high.  Pasta dishes are in the $50 range with meat and fish dishes in the $70.  Service is slow and unattentively given the prices, though once you get someone's attention, everyone is gracious and helpful.",Good,Good,Good
"We've eaten at Nello several times over the years, but every time we go, we are disappointed. The prices are outrageous, the pasta, meh, and the service often indifferent. 


We ordered cacio e pepe and a salad with langoustines. The cacio e pepe was utterly bland and undistinguished. The langoustine-- 85$/6!- were good but bordering on soft and mushy.


We had ordered a bottle of wine to go with the meal: we went through three different selections from the wine list before we found one that the restaurant actually had. Our pasta arrived-- meant to be eaten immediately-- and we still had no wine. We wound up with a 200$ bottle instead of the $125 we started with, and we were not given the original price or any discount. We were offered a free dessert, but we don't do dessert, so we had a digestive instead, hardly worth $75!


The service might have been professional had the server evinced the slightest interest in whether we were enjoying our meal. 


That's the last time.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"What a fun way to spend our last afternoon in the City! We'd been to Nello a number of times over the years and have always had a good time. We sat at a table this time (they hadn't opened bar seating yet) and enjoyed looking out onto Madison - it was the best day of our Memorial Day Weekend. 
Service is great as is the food and Truffle Truffle Truffle - and if we hadn't already had Caviar we would have been all set. The wine list was very good as well. Server had good suggestions. 
It's an expensive restaurant but worth it!",Good,Good,Good
"Rude, cocky and Un inviting. Food not worth the cold, waiting and anguish experienced. Do not recommend.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I‚Äôm always surprised to read anything negative about Nello. I have been a regular patron (I.e., I go there once or twice a week and, when not there, I order in from there) for at least the past 7 years and I absolutely love it. It‚Äôs a couple of blocks from where I live and so it has become my favorite ‚Äúgo to‚Äù place. The staff is always friendly and courteous and they make every visit a special occasion, the food is unbelievably outstanding, the place is gorgeous, and always has an interesting crowd. The prices - frankly, I have never thought the prices were an issue because of the overall superb quality of the total experience. Nello is one of the places I have really missed during this Covid lockdown, which currently appears to have no end in sight. Hopefully, that will change soon because I miss their Caesar salad, chicken soup, angel hair pasta in marinara sauce, halibut, steak ‚Äîreally, there isn‚Äôt anything on the menu I don‚Äôt absolutely crave! Please reopen soon, Nello! I miss you!",Good,Good,Good
"Surprised by the reviews because this was a very nice cafe/restaurant!


Come across by chance from a long walk through Central Park and then down 5th Avenue.


The place oozed with 5th Avenue class and seemed more New Yorker and less touristy.


The food was nice and the coffee was great so would recommend.


The price is like the rest of New York and so it is not cheap but nor is a swanky place in the best parts of London so what do you expect.


Would visit again.",Good,Good,
"We went to Nello at the recommendation of friends, and we found this establishment to be comfortable and very beautifully decorated. The waitstaff were friendly and competent. Once you read the menu, you find Italian choices that are all beautiful...however the prices make you gasp! The two of us had one bottle of mineral water, two salads, one pasta dish, 2 glasses of wine and 2 desserts, and the total came to $240.While our food was very well prepared, the prices are entirely out of proportions at this place. Morale: before you enter, check the menu and the corresponding prices. Had we done this, we would not have gone there! Live and learn...",Bad,Good,Good
"We visit New York from time to time and when we walk Madison Ave., at lunch time, we used to dine in any of the several restaurants that where along that fashion avenue north of 60th St. Many of them disappeared but one is staying there for almost 30 years.


We decided to have lunch there, Nello, although we knew from other visits the excessive high prices they charge for what they offer. Is our decision whether to attend or not to the site but I have to state that those prices are over the New York average.


One example of what I am saying is the smallness served in the just $45 Prosciutto e Melone portion where we need a magnifying glass to discover the scarce melone. Nothing to remember about the main courses, except the same high prices, not to speak about the wine.


Finally, to crown a non-repeatable lunch, and against the trend in NY and other cities where 9 out of 10 restaurants, not only do not charge the tip but even do not suggest percentages as it used to be until recent times, they charge ""only"" 20% as compulsory tip. Do the personnel receive this amount ?",Bad,Bad,
"Ambience was great.
Meals were over priced. 
Waiters were friendly. 
Decoration was perfect.
Nice place to have a drink.",Bad,Good,Good

"Nello is a beautifully decorated place, cozy with a nice menu. We went for lunch without a reservation and they were very accommodating. Food was delicious and prompt service.",Good,Good,Good
You may experience discrimination. I witnessed it. It was pathetic. People sue for such a treatment and win. I will never return. The food was ok. NYC has a lot of excellent restaurants with great service and amazing food. This is not one of them. Too much hype for nothing. Staff was rude. Flies everywhere. Waiters messed up our order and the one of people next table to us.,,Bad,Bad
Terrible to say the least!!! Wine is incredible expensive. Service was terrible. Food just average. So overrated!!!!,Bad,,Bad
"I'd give zero stars if I could. This was probably the most disappointing restaurant I've eaten at in NYC. The woman's bathroom had pee all over the seats that I had to wipe off to use. The sinks had water all over it. It wouldn't be so bad if I didn't see one of the male staff using the ladies restroom before I entered. He left that as the condition I found it in. When you pay $300 for a meal for two and have two drinks and two entree, you expect cleanliness. This is especially true when you see 5-6 male waitstaff standing around. They were exchanging money in front of customers or tripping over each other asking the same questions. 


The food. It was okay. My husband had a bolognese that was decent. I ordered Chilean sea bass that was supposed to have rice pilaf. It came with white rice. It was unfortunate I had to use the restroom early in my meal as it certainly colored the rest of my experience. I should have checked yelp BEFORE eating there. 


I asked for a manager as I was paying. I wanted to provide feedback, but the response I received from the young man as he hovered above me watching me fill out the tip information that this kind of things happen. Yes, it does, young man, but we expect that in a public bathroom and not a restaurant that charges these prices. If you want to be luxe, have clean facilities with higher standards",,Bad,Bad
"A small plate of pasta for 30-60 USD! Ok taste, but it was not very good. They served us 2 bottles of still Water, not asking if we would like tab Water. They charded us 30 dollars for the Water and added 50 dollars for tips without asking us. Im still in shock. What a terrible, terrible place",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I have been to many fine dining Italian in NYC and London and thought this place was good but way overpriced. We had 2 salads 2 meals 2 desserts and their cheapest wine and it was over $400. Veal Milanese was $80. As good as the food is it‚Äôs not worth the price. 


Place overprices food and drink because of its great location. Walk a few blocks east or west north or south and you‚Äôll get great Italian for half the price. Staff definitely  tries to push a more expensive wine. The one we ordered they claimed was fine but we insisted it was the only one we were interested in and sure enough they ‚Äòfound‚Äô the last bottle. 


Bit of a scam! Hard pass!",Bad,Bad,Bad
The food is average quality and way too expensive.  Staff is rude and their only objective is to sell more at ridiculously high prices.  The setting is very basic (nothing special) and a failed attempt to a family Italian restaurant.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"Very expensive lunch, but I suppose in this area and for this class of place one has to expect it. The most noticeable feature was attention to detail. Everything was immaculate and the manager (proprietor?) spent the whole time fussing around getting things absolutely right ‚Äì realigning a wine glass here, moving a chair an inch or two there, or instructing the bar tender on rearranging the counter. The d√©cor was bright and attractive, with an odd but appealing African theme, even though everything else was Italian. 
The food was excellent as well. I had the shrimp and mascarpone and my wife had a beet salad. The wines by the glass were well chosen but limited in number and outrageously priced.
Overall a very pleasant experience, tempered somewhat when the bill arrived.",Good,Good,Good

"Food is good but ridiculously high priced. Wine prices also sky high. Loud. The coup de gras:  our friend and hostess, a regular Nello customer, was nearly further taken to the cleaners here. The waiter avoided informing her that a generous service charge was already incorporated into the tab for our group.

"To be honest, most of the French and Italian restaurants in New York are snobbish too small places with too old waiters and serving poor food. 


The Nello experience started a bit strange with a never ending waterfall of specialties and suggestions by the gerant. 


But then the dishes came in, rapid, smooth and in abundance. And fair is fair. Great taste. Very well done. 


We had a great meal. The atmosphere was great. And it made a great evening.",Good,Good,Good
I dropped here for lunch and with a nice view of the street. Service was friendly and I had the Dover sole and a glass of wine. They put the tip on automatically and my total for lunch was $170. Food was good but way overpriced for lunch.,,Good,Good
"This place is so overpriced and snobby, couldn‚Äôt eat the pasta because it was so spicy and bad, it was freezing cold in the restaurant, not a nice experience 40 dollar for a starter mozzarella tomato.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The food is good but it‚Äôs not really Italian (names misspelled, wrong ingredients, etc) but it‚Äôs good.


The service is ok but pretty frenetic, they don‚Äôt give the impression of caring too much about you, about answering any questions, listing what you are saying etc.


The environment is very nice but you have to seat outside. Inside it‚Äôs super loud. In between inside-outside you are pressed to the people next to you, so between the music and the people talking super close to you, it‚Äôs really difficult to have a conversation.


The prices are completely insane for what you get. We had for lunch 2 main dishes (a pasta and a cotoletta), 2 glasses of Prosecco and a bottle of water and we paid more than $200.


It‚Äôs well known so go just to know it but be prepared because it‚Äôs completely overrated.",,,Good
"From the moment we entered the experience was underwhelming. A bit of a haughty air in the staff. Food was adequate but almost comically over-priced. I was meeting with clients from Korea and South America. The restaurant was the suggestion of one of their friends which led us to conclude as we left that we would have been better off just randomly selecting a place. We shared one bottle of unremarkable wine, all ate pasta dishes and paid over $700 for what was more like a $275 meal.",Bad,Bad,Bad

"I've never been angry about a restaurant until this one!


Here's our Valentine's Day dinner experience:


1) We tried to call when we knew we'd be 15 minutes late as a courtesy: they'd taken the phone off the hook. 2) We had to wait 15 minutes in a crowded little area to be seated once we arrived. 3) They didn't have the wine we wanted on the menu. 3) The wine they suggested (without mentioning the price) cost as much per glass as a decent bottle at a wine store. 4) They didn't have one of the first courses we wanted from the menu. 5) The bread served had been cut hours before and was coarse. 6) The entrees took a long time to come. 7) The food was no better than that from an average neighborhood Italian restaurant. 8) My wife ordered a truffle pasta offered by the waiter, who did not tell us the price, which is customary for something high-priced. When I got the bill, it was for $195. 9) The waiter never came go refill our water glasses.10) There was no option to customize a tip. It came automatically at 20%. 11) Everything at the restaurant is as high-priced as virtually any place in NYC. Final bill: $500 with only two glasses of wine!

"I went to this restaurant with the expectations of teach my teenage son what fine dining is about, but my experience was terrible. First, the attitude of the employees... arrogant and like if they were doing a favor to you, when the contrary is what is all about.They are there to please and serve you.Second, the meals, nothing special... the salad, the same flavor of the one that you get for $5 in Wendy‚Äôs, but they charged you $50....and the Saefood Pasta that I ate for $99, doesn‚Äôt worth even $15.....Definitely, a place not to go ever again.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"One large bottle of San Pellegrino water, two glasses of house wine, and two orders of pasta - $165.00 (before tip)!


The venue itself is lovely, the service impeccable, and all the small touches are there. (But disappointingly, for an Italian-focused restaurant, the olive oil is mid-range Greek?)   Noise level is quiet, something getting harder to find in NYC.  Clientele tends to be upscale.


If only they made an effort on the food!


The Paglia e Fieno, billed as basked pasta with prosciutto, green peas, and pecorino, was creamy, but flavorful as wallpaper paste.  The sauce certainly had little (if any) pecorino.  A shame, because it could have been wonderful.  Price tag?  $49!  The I Rapini, (broccoli rabe, garlic and oil tossed with orecchiette) was simple, light, and $45 for one portion.  


Extortionate prices aside, I would go back here - IF the food was well-prepared.  But as it is, if you are passing by, keep walking.",Bad,Good,Good
"Its a beautiful restaurant with a beautiful ambiance located along 5th Ave.  some staff were very friendly but some they‚Äôre bit cold. I had an spaghetti bolognese and tiramisu, food are good but its expensive.  + Its in good location.",Good,Good,
"I always have a rubric when I rate places . It‚Äôs not just willy nilly. I ask myself - what is the view? Is there live music or any music? Does it have wheelchair access, WiFi? Is there a valet? Can I say the food is on the level of a 5-Star Michelin restaurant? Is there ambience or a good atmosphere? Finally, what is the value for money? Those kinds of things. So this place should technically get a 2. I‚Äôm giving it a 4 because the scope of TripAdvisor only gives me words like ‚Äúaverage or above average‚Äù - so where do go from there? I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs average, I‚Äôm not that cold hearted. But does it tick any 5 star boxes other than white tablecloths and ... well, nicer food than the local dive bar? There is no music or live music, the prices are hysterical, no view, no WiFi, no valet, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the elderly or disabled or those in wheelchairs going because it‚Äôs so tight and small and cramped. Oh yes - there is a dolled up waiter looking like your own private butler which is nice, but he has the manners of a hovering vulture! 


The food itself is better than a pub, but not 5-star gourmet. I have eaten in San Sebasti√°n which was the food capital of the world a few years back with Michelin restaurants on every corner. Those who eat it while looking at a street (not a lake or an ocean or mountains) and give this place 5 stars are delusional. 


There was absolutely no human soul inside the restaurant and we didn‚Äôt go that late (9:30pm?) - totally boring and stale atmosphere. Nobody there until we left at 11:30. Says a lot.


The decorations in the restaurant were nice, the peonies on my table were sweet. But can it justify the prices?",Bad,Bad,
"We have been here many times. The ambience is wonderful, service excellent and the food choices are varied. Several of us had the shaved artichokes with Parmesan slices and avocado with lemon, delicious. For man in choice we had pasta with spiced sausage, risotto with lobster and pasta with lobster . All very good. Very relaxed. I should add it is expensive. Still worth it",Good,Good,Good
"My family decided to have a lunch at Nello to celebrate my son's birthday. What a great place for it! Amazing food, great service, beautiful decorations. You very welcome and its makes you wanna comeback right away. Highly recommend",Good,Good,Good
Really is a first class spot. I had Ahi Tuna and my wife had a pasta dish. They were both very good and the waitstaff is exceptional. Definitely a good spot.,Good,Good,Good
"My wife and me went for lunch. Service was Superb, they treated us like royalty. Loved the food. Also the restaurant is beautiful and was incredibly decorated for Christmas. Thanks to all there.",Good,Good,Good
"I always leave 5 stars reviews where ever I have been. This because whenever I have complaints I prefer to share them in private, with the owner or the manager. I think it is pathetic that people use Tripadvisor to kill businesses. Up until today...  Nello is the only restaurant that deserves never to have a client again. They serve normal food (not bad, nothing especial) for ridiculous prices. The owner obviously prefers not to pay his employees a decent salary so he puts a 20% tip on top off the bill. 20% on top off a price which is completely ridiculous by itself. I had dinner in El Celler de Can Roca in Girona, Spain. Probably the best restaurant in the world. Their prices are cheap compared to what Nello is calculating. The food of El Celler  is not 10 times better, but closer to a 1.000 times better. As a warning Nello should change its name in ‚ÄúCapone‚Äù. At least it would be a warning of what to expect.",Bad,,
"I have walked past Nello many times over the years coming and going to midtown from my hotel (The Lowell) which is right around the corner from this place. 


Was out doing some Christmas shopping for the loved ones and decided to give it a try for a late lunch today and boy was that the right decision. 


While explaining the daily specials the server, Stefano, told me that, ‚Äúthe white truffles are in the house,‚Äù and explained what dishes they can be served with. 


I was already craving carpaccio when he said they have it with white truffles so I ordered that plus minestrone, and a grilled vegetable plate. 


The soup was served first and unlike the usual progresso red versions that are full of beans and over cooked carrots this version was full of fresh, just cooked celery, carrots, cabbage and peas in a clear broth flavored with pesto. Fantastic! 


To anyone that wants to try white truffles, the first thing you need to know is they are in a class by themselves...nothing else tastes and has an unforgettable aroma like they do. And like all rare, limited availability items in this world, they are expensive so be prepared for some sticker shock if you want to try them. In my opinion they taste and smell nothing like black truffles, and I am happy to pay the market rate every Nov- Dec when they are available. So caveat emptor. 


Needless to say the carpaccio with white truffles was fantastic and I was so happy I tried that dish. The grilled veggies were also delish. 


Not being a dessert person I opted for a long black, which was the perfect finale to an unexpectedly delicious and satisfying meal. 


I will definitely make a point of coming back here on my next trip and would recommend it if you‚Äôre in the neighborhood.",Good,Good,Good

"Went shopping on Madison Avenue with my sister, had dumped about $1000 on dinner the night before so I‚Äôm not afraid to spend money, on a truly wonderful culinary experience. Own my own business, I do alright. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm from the Midwest but..This place was a joke. It caught our eye because the outside, Decor and the flowers inside were obviously beautiful... like so many other reviewers the shock came when we opened up the menu. 


$100 for an appetizer? $50 for a bowl of soup?! This place? The place was half empty ..there was a woman who‚Äôs dog had her own seat at the table next to me, that‚Äôs when I should‚Äôve known that we were in the wrong place. And like I said ..had it been a unique culinary experience OK, but this one was average at best. Really, anyone on here saying it was fantastic or even anything above average simply just wants to be seen here lol. I‚Äôll take my $500 lunch and spend it shopping thanks. Whoever owns that place needs to seriously reevaluate their position.",Bad,Bad,
"I went to Nello for lunch after shopping on Madison. The menu and specials sounded delicious. I ordered a starter and specifically asked for it without raw onions. It was delivered with. Upon my complaint it was quickly replaced. But from then on the staff made a point of ignoring me. No one came by to refill water, no one asked how the food was. The food was delicious but the staff are beyond arrogant. Not sure why - as customers - anyone would want to be treated that way. Nello - never again.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Tried to make a reservation even considering last time prices were over the edge.
To my surprize they asked for my credit card number and stated that they now pre charge 100 dolars per person, to confirm the reservation.
They also stated that they do not return the credit if an eventual no show happens ( they mentioned that could give us credit for a next meal).
Unbelivable behave and it shows that some restaurants can not deal with their ponctual success.
No return anymore from my side.

"The place has an austere feel. To it with beautiful flowers, and terrific food.  The only issue is very high prices but quality is there for sure. When appetizers get into the $20 for simple pasta or salad and the veal is $73   You need to be treated or have really big bucks.   I was on my own so I ordered a simple but elegant pasta dish. And dessert and coffee for $55 .  It was worth it and service was very good.

"While walking on Madison Ave shopping, we decided to stop for dinner at whatever was nearest to us. This turned out be Nello's. The place is clean, with crisp white table clothes, brightly lit, and has a fine dining feel. We were promptly seated at a window seat by polite and professional servers.  The shock came when the menu was presented. We landed on three appetizers, consisting of chicken soup ($27), chicken liver with onion ($29), and baby artichokes ($29), and a bottle of San Pellegrino ($15). Entrees started above $40 for a chicken breast with mesclun and went up from there. The soup and liver were OK. The 3 small artichokes were not. This place either needs to drop their prices to fit the quality of the food, or increase the quality of what is served. I recommend you opt for a different restaurant if you are in this area.",Bad,Good,Good
"We loved the food at Nello.  Yes a bit over-priced, but worth it.  I don't think I've ever finished the whole plate of gnocchi before, and I easily could have had more!  Everyone enjoyed the meals. The only problem was the hostess was hovering too much near our table at the front of the restaurant -- just a bit awkward.  We will definitely go back!",Good,Good,Bad

"When you walk into Nello you feel the sophistication of a fine dining restaurant. The huge branches of  spring flowers ready to burst into bloom tower over your head. You are seated at a table draped with crisp white cloth and handed the wine list and menu. 
We joined friends for lunch and started with shaved baby artichokes with a shaving of Parmesan cheese and fresh lemon dressing. The pasta with black truffles was shared by a couple of our group and perfect slices of steak on arugula. 
All the pastas served for the main courses were sauced just right and not over cooked. We drank lovely white burgundy wine and finished with fresh berries that remind you that spring is on its way.",Good,Good,

"When you are in a fine dining New York, you expect to spend money. This restaurant makes sure you do that. The food was average, wine too expensive, the still water was also in a pricey bottle despite asking for table water.

The staff is really polite and helpful though even at midnight.",Bad,,Good
"Strengths, Good atmosphere, very busy, which is why we called in. Great for people watching.
Weaknesses, Prices are outrageous for what you get. $40 for an average bowl of pasta.$15 for a bottle of still water, be careful of the desserts, the waiter will tell you about them and expect you to order. We shared a below average cr√®me brulee and paid $21 for the privilege. Coffee is another $10.

"This place is exquisite. It‚Äôs a fine place to enjoy a lunch or dinner on Madison Avenue, NYC. So expect to pay Madison Avenue prices. I see a lot of negative comments about the restaurant and price but I feel it‚Äôs well worth a visit. It‚Äôs quaint and beautiful. 


I found the restaurant really amazing. Personally I would go there again. 
We enjoyed an early dinner there during thanksgiving weekend. It was quiet but it‚Äôs a beautiful place to eat. 


The staff are friendly and accommodating. They have an extensive wine and food menu, all Italian with many options for pasta and bread lovers, gluten free and they are willing work with requests. 


It‚Äôs a place to treat yourself. I enjoyed the Dover sole and a friend the pasta. Everything is well presented and delicious. Various salads to choose from. 


What I love about this place is that the restroom is in the basement, but it‚Äôs neat, clean and exquisite. Not normal for many Nyc restaurants as most aren‚Äôt clean. 


Overall it‚Äôs a lovely place to enjoy a bubbly or pasta and wine, fish, meat, chicken.",Good,Good,Good
"The food was good, no complains. But nothing special at all.  Maybe good pasta iin USA is so hard to find that allows them to charge $45 for spaghetti. Prices are not justified.

"My husband booked us here for a lovely dinner our 2nd night in Manhattan, partly because it was walking distance from our hotel. I am still in shock at the bill.
The restaurant is pleasant with fabulous floral arrangements on the bar.  We were greeted warmly and shown our table. My husband ordered a vodka straight up with a twist and I ordered a Tom Collins. I was brought an Arnold Palmer.  It's ok, they changed it but we were already at 47 dollars for 2 drinks.  My husband had a small lackluster endive salad with Gorgonzola $34.00 and I had 5 small slices of beets and a dollop of goat cheese 30.00.  The biggest let down was my main course. I had the linguine Vongole. Pasta with white clam and wine sauce.  The portion was small, the pasta tough and the clams sandy. $52.00 . My husband had the Ossobucco and while the taste was delicious it was on the tough side.  $69.00.  We shared a fruit and cream dish for dessert $26.00 and a CAppucino $10.00 . But what really taught us a lesson was NEVER let your waiter suggest a house red wine.  2 glasses, $70.00 . The total for the bill with tax was $367.99
Are you KIDDING ME??????? There was a loud ostentatious table next to us who are obviously regulars. You can fool some of the people some of the time but you will NEVER get us back there.  This place is a joke. AVOID!!",Bad,Bad,

Somehow , they have a direct line to the  best stuff available . Followed by Dover Sole. .A half bottle of Gaja white . The pasta was 325 each , bill,over 1000, most expensive lunch we ever had  ! Is it worth the price ? Depends how much you love white Truffle !",Good,,
"We ordered 3 main dishes, two were specials and one was a truffle pasta. The servings were very small and the pasta and other dishes very ordinary indeed. When the bill came it was $500 for the 3 of us and we only had 3 glasses of wine and a bottle of water. When we questioned the $180 for the 'special' pasta dish the waiter said truffle is very expensive. Oh really! Well I would have thought maybe an extra $20-$30 on top on a regular price. In this case they charge average of $49 for ordinary pasta dish. How many people are being ripped off by these operators. They simply don't deserve to be in business trying rip into their customers. The waiter never discussed the price of the dish. I hope this review save others from this place. I should have refereed to this site as I normally do. Instead we were recommended by a taxi driver who was probably on the take with these guys, as he said to mention his name! Be warned! Not even worth 1 star.",Bad,Bad,Bad
I am Celiac.  I had a conversation with the server about the ingredients of their chicken soup.  He reassured me that noodles were not in it - they were cooked separately and added when wanted.  The soup was served and it was a little cloudy which I assumed was its consistency.  But as I neared the bottom of the bowl there was a layer of noodles and I had obviously eaten some of them - they were very small and looked like strands of a vegetable!  My husband insisted on not paying for my soup but I think they should have done more.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"God knows why we ended up at Nello's. perhaps because of outside dining ? The prices are one of  the worst value for money in NYC. The place was empty (which should have been a warning) except for another table and the prices were so horrendous for normal dishes that the 10 of us decided to have just one dish, no wine and just leave. We particularly disliked the way we were treated by the waiters.
To be avoided.",Bad,Bad,Bad

"This restaurant is in a very upscale area of Madison Avenue but it's totally not worth it.
The prices are way too expensive for what it offers.

This is totally not worth and would not advise it.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I eat out 3-10x a week and almost always highly rated places. The food here is amongst the best and this, subjective as is, is unequivocal. The service can be offensive, at worst, and a blessing, at best- all in the French or Italian spectrum of rudeness or politeness, respectively. There are rumors about the service, when bad, and they revolve around certain unscrupulous behavior of ownership with staff but they surely know what it means to give proper service and the food is so amazing that the bad potential service- of which I never experienced- can be stomached for the superb food.... perhaps. The price- high; clientele- let's say that there is invariably a Bentley, Phantom, etc. national police blocking the view and I pass by almost every day.",Good,Good,Good
"My wife and I recently went to Nello on a Sunday afternoon; few people dining but plenty of tuxedoed waiters;  the waiters spent almost all the time standing in a group at the bar talking in Italian.  Two specials were recommended - a grilled octopus salad - very little octopus almost all lettuce $55 and lobster ravioli - small portion, little lobster $65; we were not told the price in advance by the waiter;  service was very slow; bathrooms downstairs and hard to enter; definitely the worst experience we have ever had dining in NYC over many trips to the city; will never go again",Bad,Bad,Bad

"You either love it or hate it. We love it! For as long as we've been married, we've enjoyed coming here. We love staying at The Four Seasons and walking over to Nello. Sometimes food memories are better than the food itself. But at Nello, the food always stands out. Yes, there are many incredible places in NYC but this is our favorite. 


We came here in the Fall (to see Hamilton amongst other things like eat!). We arrived a little after lunch and headed over. This time from the St. Regis.
They tried to stick us inside till we reminded them our concierge called for a ""ringside"" table. Wish granted. We sat outside. The people watching here is quite delightful! 


The marscapone shrimp risotto and my off-menu ($95) lobster pasta were the absolute bomb. Totally satisfying. We barely had room for dessert but our sweet waiter says he comes in to make the panna cotta every morning at 6 so we had to order one. It was delicious. 


Nello is not cheap but it is a lovely and delicious walk down memory lane every time. We visited again for dinner when our daughter flew in to join us 2 days later. Fabulous every time!",Good,Good,Good
"Is a steal,, the most expensive and ridiculously restaurant in New York, they charge 200 dollars for a pasta üò±üò±üò± please dont go there if you dont want to your waste your money, is the wost place in new you",Bad,Bad,
"From the amazing Manhattans by the top notch bartender, Joseph , to the elegant and delicious dinner afterward, we highly recommend this dining experience to the most discerning diners in NYC. The location on Madison Ave. is second to none. Great energy and a lovely place to spend the evening .",Good,Good,Good
"We visited Nello on a beautiful Saturday afternoon while shopping in NY City.  Please, if you value your palate and your wallet, avoid this place at all costs.  The chicken soup tasted like dishwater, and at $25 a bowl one would think it would at least have some flavor.",Bad,Bad,
"Value if money is simply Zeroüëå, average food, not too busy. I don't recommend it.
I tried it for lunch only.
Cheers",Bad,Bad,
"Came here with my daughter and not even having wine a 100 usd per person for a simple pasta??? USD 8 for an expresso??
Sincerely not worth it!!",Bad,Bad,
"We walked in without looking over the menu-big mistake.  The food was fine, small portions and overpriced.  $22 for a glass of pro secco.  The waiter was rude and ignored us in favor of the table next to us.  I am embarrassed that we just didn't order our wine and walk away.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Nello used to be AMAZING, I used to come here a lot, but the quality of the food went down. And our waiter was beyond terrible. I really hope this place can go back to the way it was before.",Bad,Bad,Bad
It is a nice place in a nice area. We order a shrimp salad a tuna tartare and a burrata. Sparkling water. The food was quiet good. Nothing out of the ordinary. It was too expensive for the quality of the meal.,Bad,Good,
I just love it. what you see in the restaurant is as good as the food! i always spend a very good time with friends for a quick or not so quick lunch (be careful on the total bill! LOL!!),Good,Good,
Yes it's expensive but .... the PASTA is great  ;)) what a perfect surprise on a lovely Sunday morning.,Good,,
"Just landed in New York & in need of lunch this restaurant just around the corner from our hotel. On first impressions the restaurant looked impressive from the outside & was full of high end clientele. The menu was extensive for pasta,salads,meat dishes & special items. We had a good meal of a salad, 2 pasta dishes, chicken a bottle of wine & some coffees & the bill came to over $400!! We enjoyed our time here as a relaxing lunch but just be aware. After all the restaurant is situated on Madison Avenue & great for people watching!!",Good,Good,
"We were walking by and decided to stop for lunch.  As others have noted, prices are very high (45 for ravioli and other pasta dishes), portions are very small.


Given the location, one should expect the high prices, service was just OK given the pricing.


I suspect their average customer drops over 100/person, and more if you have more than one glass of wine with your meal.  


I can't complain about the food, it was very good for what it was.


Hopefully people will 1) look at the menu before going in and/or 2) look at the reviews on line so they know what to expect (on price).",Good,,
"The food was average to mediocre but the prices are a total ripoff, a $45 for a lobster bisque and a $95 for a lobster pasta that the waiter recommended my son was a total scam. 


With so many options of Italian food in manhattan PLEASE STAY AWAY, TERRIBLE TERRIBLE",Bad,Bad,
"Stopped by for a coffee at 11am on a hot Sunday morning.


The tables were nicely laid out except for the ones on the street.
There is no sun protection and the sun was ferocious so we soon headed to the bar for our by now long awaited coffee.


An astonishingly unsuitable kind of rap music was thumping out of the surround sound speakers turning a mellow balmy Sunday morning into an unpleasant one.


Took the cheque, $20 plus taxes for the 2 coffees.


Glad we tried Nello as it looked nice, but clearly won't return. 


Getting fleeced is bad enough without insulting one's ears having to listen such diabolical noise.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"It is very rare that I consider a good restaurant overpriced when I have an excellent meal, but Nello is the first one. We paid $1000 worth of average to mediocre pasta, we were 9 people including 4 children that ordered Alfredo spaghetti!
My 13 year old son who was at the end of the table asked the waiter for a suggestion and he was kind enough to suggest a lobster pasta, he didn't even liked it, and was a $100 alone! 
After this it didn't surprised me that the restaurant was almost empty.
I am frustrated that with all the amazing options NY has to offer we ended up here!",Bad,Bad,
I have been to Nello's 5 years ago and it was an expensive but however nice Italian Restaurant. Now it is just an over priced place where food without a soul is served by waiters who are only passionate about selling. They tell you the specials but never the price. The food lacks of taste and esprit and I can only recommend to never go there! I am certain that I will never again.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had a couple of daily specials and a bottle of decent wine. It all came up to 950 USD. What a rip-off. Waiters are trained to sell you their grandmother.


When you expected the ""old"" Nello from around 5 years ago. Forget about it!
The old owner sold the place to a soul-empty tourist trap crew of fake Italians with an attitude.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Just outrageous. As a long time resident of Manhattan, I pride myself on avoiding places like this. Not sure what I did here but I had my fave ripped off at lunch today. Diner food at champagne prices indeed. $45 for a bowl of pasta with eggplant and mozzarella cheese. 
Call the cops. I was robbed.",Bad,Bad,
"Service was lacking, food was good but WAY too expensive for what we got!!  I got the lobster pasta and pasta was overcooked and sauce was a bit salty.  Not sure if i will go back.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"TRUST the reviews. Extremely overpriced. Don't let them get you. 


I was walking outside looking for a place to grab lunch, the guy in the front of Nello came out and let us know he had a table for us. Very hungry, we followed him into the restaurant. We were very confused by the atmosphere.The music was loud, you almost felt like you were at a club. Very very interesting crowd. We ordered 2 mini bottles of champagne which cost $80 for very very cheap champagne which was very disappointing. We then continued to look at the menu to find that a salad was $40.00 and seeing the portion size as well, we knew this wasn't a good choice. I then looked up the reviews, to find that this place was 2 stars and had terrible reviews. We felt like we were being robbed. We asked for the check for the champagne right away after seeing this. There people were scam artist. Don't waste your money here. Like I said TRUST the reviews.",Bad,Bad,
"good atmosphere , good clients , important people from new york ,various choice of expensive red wine ,",,Good,Good
"Value of money 0$, too expensive, food was soooo normal, desert was good though & service was okay too.",Bad,,Good
"We had enjoyed a delicious brunch and already had dinner plans for the evening, but while walking down the street the beautiful holiday decorations drew us in for an afternoon drink! It was gorgeous for the Christmas Season so we ventured inside only to find how nice it was inside also. The bar was small but welcoming when we walked in and we sat down to enjoy an afternoon beverage before we continued our shopping adventures. Next visit to NYC we plan to make reservations and taste their fare because we had such a nice visit this time!",Good,Good,
"Pretty good Italian restaurant on Madison avenue with classic menu. Dishes are good enought but not perfect, service is ok, had to ask few times our server to remove the plates from the table. Overstaffed, do not undertand why they need so much staff if service is not perfect. No one watch the table. Service if poor, the bill is high, food quality is average. But for the NYC it is not bad, could be worse.",Bad,,Bad
The food was just great  - they made a special dish as I had a restricted diet and it was fantastic !,Good,,
"We had a reasonable quality food, but nothing special.  But the prices at this restaurant are absurdly expensive.",Good,,
"We've came across this place while waking on Madison. We usually check places and read reviews in advance but this time we didn't and it was our mistake. We were not super hungry, just wanted something light since we were planning on a fulfilling dinner. Anyways, the place looked packed with people and we thought it was a good sign. Atmosphere was very vibrant with nice music playing and fresh flowers on each table but wait until after they bring you the bill!
We couldn't choose ANYTHING from the menu that we felt like trying! So we decided to go with their appealing specials which was beef carpaccio with white truffles (seasonal!) and a pasta with white sauce with white truffles as well. The price wasn't announced by the waiter but we assumed if the most expensive dish on the menu (some steak) was priced for $79 so we thought how expensive the dishes we wanted to try could be?! 1 appetizer and 1 pasta to share! (and 2 glasses of red wine)! 
Beef carpaccio and a plain shared pasta flaked with some white truffles was for the total cost of $470!!! ($175 and $295 accordingly) plus 2 glasses of wine and their 20% gratuity charged on top of the bill for the table of 2, we ended up leaving the restaurant with $670 bill!!! This experience was unforgettably mediocre for the price outrageously high! Some people's reviews said that it's a joint for celebrities to dine in. Well, if at least we saw one there today, it would be at least the place to remember sitting right next to Pierce Brosnan while munching on these rare and seasonal flakes of white truffles! Unfortunately, it turned out to be the place mediocre in all aspects of food experiences! Our waiter said that he didn't want to offend us by announcing the price out loud when he talked about their specials. Well, he didn't want to offend us but he could have done us a great favor by mentioning the price. Other restaurants do it and we don't find it offending! We've tried Mechelin rated restaurants and we totally agreed with prices charged for the food and the service presented but not at this place! My advice: avoid Nello even if you are super hungry or at least ask for the prices on dishes they announce. Rip off!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Friendly staff but the food was average and crazy expensive.  Popped in for an unexpected lunch and it cost over $170 + tip for my wife and I.


This is what we ordered:


Bellini (ordered 2)
Mozzarella di Bufala Salad (wasn't all that great either...)
Carpaccio appetizer 
Chicken Noodle Soup (noodles look like they came from a Lipton cup of soup bag)
Campari & Soda 


2 salads, a soup and a couple of drinks for $170?  Unlikely that we would go back again.",Bad,Bad,Good
"One of the best kept secrets in upper east side...nice people, nice customers lovely lunch break!!

"My wife and I periodically splurge at this once-fine Italian restaurant. Had dinner .last time we were in NYC November 2016 - and ordered our two favorite dishes that we always do. The clam linguine that we shared as an appetizer was just terrible! Salty to the point of choking!  The sauce tasted like dish water. For the first time since we have been coming to Nello - we actually had the dish returned to the kitchen. Then the veal came out completely wrong. For some bizarre reason the chef put watery red sauce on the dish.  I asked the manager on duty what the heck is going on and does he have the usual great Italian chef in the kitchen. Turns out no Italian chef was working in the kitchen. That would explain the horrible Mexican style Italian food that was coming out of the kitchen. Also as I looked around for our usual Italian waiters - all we could find were Mexican waiters. I asked the manager if Nello was now a Mexican restaurant. He laughed. I said he shouldn't laugh and just change the name of this once great Italian restaurant to ""Nello Mexicana"".",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Very overpriced.  Nice ambience.  Servers were clueless.  So much cologne, I couldn't smell the wine.  Sommelier/server/busser was promoting California Pinot THAT WAS FROM OREGON!   Dover sole was nice, But not 75 dollars nice.  Not on list to go back.",Bad,Good,Bad
"We had lunch at Nello on a beautiful afternoon. The open air ambience literally captured us off the sidewalk as did the flowers and smartly dressed wait staff on the sidewalk. 
After absorbing the sticker shock, the food was decent at best. For the prices charged, we felt somewhat short-changed. We did sit next to Pierce Brosnan, however, which made the ladies in our group quite happy.",Good,Good,Good
"We stumbled upon this restaurant for lunch. Lots of people were eating here so we figure it should be good. We ordered grilled veggies, carpaccio and lobster pasta. The grilled veggies had no real flavor, the carpaccio was bland and the worst I had and we order carpaccio a lot. The pasta had lots of lobster meat but the sauce was just ok.


They also charged 20% tip on the bill seeing we were tourists. Did not appreciate it but we paid since we have no problem with money, however their service was not worth it. They came by after we fished eating to see how we were doing.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Unfriendly service poor food very expensive!!!


To be avoided.


Nothing was good except the proximity of the restaurant to the Pierre Hotel where want staying.


With such a huge choice in NYC it was probably my fault but I would never go back.


Hot food was cold needed to be sent back.


Disgraceful for close to 300 USD 


Two simple courses the cold pasta.


Not a happy experience!!!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This tiny, good italian restaurant serves a very Good.
While walking there you must try it .
Trendy place, beautifull people.  Nice weather, try the tables on the outside.
Tables are small, no privacy but you will have a nice time",Good,Good,
The food is amazing the place is really nice it's located on Madison Avenue and if you want to see famous people passing by famous people just eating a lunch and is the place to see and binge be seen it's really good and I can tell you it's a place must go to New York at least a few hours for a drink or for pasta,Good,Good,
"Walking on Madison we saw this lovely Italian restaurant, white table linens, the front was open as it was a beautiful day, we chose a table inside for lunch, due to traffic noise. The menu offered pastas priced around $40, and the server suggested a special, Tagliatelle with lobster... which we both chose. It was very average, too sweet, eminently forgettable.  There was room behind both of us at our table for the server to pass.. yet he, and the server who followed, leaned over me, actually resting his arm on my shoulder to serve my wife sitting opposite, and to clear the plates leaned over my wife to remove my plate, repeated by a different server for our coffee. But the most preposterous part of the lunch was the check.. $254 plus service = $300. Two pastas, 2 beers, 2 coffees. The price of the pasta 'special'.. $95 each. I was furious.. and told them that they should have informed us that the special cost more than double a listed pasta. After an argument, they deducted one pasta dish. We paid and left.. never to return!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Snobby service, lovely table linens. Snobby service, had to be begged to be noticed. Snobby service, I'm seventy ( and still pretty awesome in most people's eyes, but, evidently, not in the eyes of a Madison Avenue waitstaff).  Snobby service, $36 for pasta Pomodoro, and $15 for a large bottle of Pellegrino that was opened and poured before I had a chance to say that if there were no small bottles available, I'd have tap water. I paid cash so my husband wouldn't faint when he saw the bill for a quick lunch in New York. Stay in Wellesley and go to Alta Strada, where the same dish is much more delicious and the waiters aren't jerks.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Nello is the worst place to enjoy your meal with your friends. The staff are terrible and they all (including the arrogant manager) need to have intensive trainings in customer service.


We stayed for 30 minutes only because we kept on asking for the menu, but we didn't get it. One waiter didn't even look at us when we called him. Another one said that they were very busy, but the restaurant was almost empty. When we told the manager that we were leaving, he pulled the table and said okay. He had no interest in knowing why we decided to leave or if there were anything wrong !!!!


This place was below expectations and overrated.",,Bad,Bad
"We went to dinner at Nello last night. Every aspect was exceptional. Staff, service, ambiance, food and wine. We're definitely going to become regulars here. A little pricey but you get what you pay for. I had the bass with miso glaze..... best I ever had! My girlfriend had the salmon and it was also a great piece of fish perfectly prepared. We had a glass of French Pinot noir which we throughly enjoyed. The waiters have great personalities and made the whole experience even more pleasant. We'll be back.",Good,Good,Good
Nello is an amazing italian restaurant.. The food is authentic and the service impecable!!! Great environment!,Good,Good,Good
"Great veal Solentina. Like amazing great. Best ever outside Rome. Great prosciutto and rockmelon. Fab wine.


Totally mixed crowd - stylish suited folk, girls with butt implants, a circular table of dour revolving Arab guests, old bankers with blonde rough trade, society folk, some  large Russians, slick haired wannabees wanting to be noticed, young  officious waiters and sensational older ones who slap them into line - love that stuff!


It's a cultural melange. Get into it!",Good,Good,
"Personally I found the food here to be very good! Everything from the bread to the desert beyond delicious.


However I have to agree the staff... They really treat you poorly. Lots of shaming you into ordering! I ordered one cocktail and when I was asked if I wanted another I declined, he may as well cursed me out.  He was far from attentive, which really takes away from the Nello experience. 


If they had friendly well mannered staff who made you part of a Nello experience from the moment you walk it, I think it would beyond enhance the experience.  Because yes it's pricey but totally worth it ... I think... 


Because I remember to food being very good! But I really remember the staff being ignorant and rude! I wish that was not the case. 


I'd like to go back! But I'll have to be in a mood where being treated poorly is something I'm willing to tolerate and pay for.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Absolute Chaos!!! If you want good Italian food go to Marea. Too expensive for the service they offer. Food if just average. Attitude of the servers and staff is terrible. It took forever to get our food. They didn't have half the wine that they offer. But most of it the attitude,,,, worst ever. So, so many choices in NYC . Just don't try this one.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"It's my first visit to NY and my husbands second. We stumbled across this place whilst I was looking for somewhere to get a blow dry! We might have stopped because I was thirsty and it was directly opposite Jimmy Choo! What a fabulous choice it turned out to be. Nice staff, very clean, crisp table linen and sparkling glass wear. We had a lot of excellent wine, 3 bottles of Ott plus amaretto G&tT's and prosecco. 2 X starters, 2 X mains and 2 X desserts. The food was sublime. You must eat the beef carpaccio off the specials and the spaghetti lobster if you dine here - it was sensational. We were looked after intently by Alvaro & John - they made our visit really really special. And then all of a sudden in walks Sir Rod Stewart & Lady Penny Lancaster. What a fabulous day it turned out to be. 


I am really surprised that this restaurant has received such low feedback, it truly does not deserve it. The prices are clearly stated on the menus so people can see in advance of ordering drinks or food what the final bill is going to be. Our bill was pretty excessive but this was due to the amount of alcohol we consumed over a very long lunch and our expensive taste in wine but in my opinion it was worth every cent and we had a truly memorable day.


Well done Nello.",Good,Good,Good
"Perhaps in today's world of checking everything on your phone, this is no longer an issue, but my husband and I dropped into Nello on the spur of the moment last Wednesday. No menu was outside and we didn't even see the name of the restaurant at first.  We ordered lightly since we had a long drive ahead of us. (We lived in NY for over 40 years, but now reside out of state, however we are well aware of what things cost since we visit often).
This is exactly what we ordered:
2 prosecco
2 salads
1 tuna tartare appetizer
1 pasta alla matriciana
2 expresso
2 desserts


Total cost before tip $275.00


As I said, we are used to NYC restaurant pricing, but frankly nothing was all that special and as we were leaving I wondered about any out-of-towners that might wander in as we did.  That is why is am writing this review.",Bad,,
If you want to hate Italian food for the rest of your life go to this restaurant. The maitre'd walked around like a bouncer. The bartender was talking to himself. The waiters treat you like idiots. The food should be served in hospitals. The prices were ridiculously over inflated. The red wine was served at a temperature as if it had been in the Sahara dessert. We will never dine there again. Save your money.,Bad,Bad,Bad
brilliant food. great location. fascinating people watching. great wine list. great service. well worth the prices!,Good,Good,Good
"We happened upon Nello today. I told the waiter I would have just a salad because I am allergic to cheese. He gave me a lovely speech about how it was the type of restaurant that would make me whatever I wanted, accommodating my allergies. I told him I'd be happy with a cheese-free salad. It came covered with cheese. There was also a line for the washroom and when my husband went to the washroom, the wait staff took away his chair. There were no apologies, just Bad and the food we could eat was forgettable.",Bad,Bad,Bad
The Buratta and Ravioli was delicious. The atmosphere is wonderful. Bring lots of money because it is very pricey!!! The wait staff is friendly. You don't feel rushed through your meal. The Tiramisu is the best I've had in a very long time!!,Good,Good,Good
"I ate here with my son before he took off on a 9 hour flight. It was a $300 lunch and my dog sat under the table.  


The food was good. I had salmon carpaccio and my son had a heavy pasta of some sort.  
 
The people watching is top notch.  


Nello is expensive. Waiters were everywhere.  I had 3 glasses of Prosecco.  I'd go back; they were not terribly understanding about the dog, but they made it work and I give the credit for that.",Good,Good,Good
Located right next to Faberge store on Madison Avenue. While we just enjoyed a glass of White Bordeaux their lunch offerings looked very appetizing. Became very busy with both local clientele and tourists. Service nice. Would recommend and return.,Good,Good,Good
"This place is what is called a TRAP. This is ridiculously expensive (270 USD for 2 pieces of fish, and a San Pellegrino). The fish of the day does not have its price listed in the menu (just so you know this is 75 dollar per person for a sole). Waiters are grinning and playing it cool (they better be as they will get 20 pct tip, no question asked, whatever the party size). One of those places you leave feeling like you just been robbed and yet you still feel hungry...In a few words: DO NOT GO there. This is an insult to Italian cuisine, and to every  respectable NYC restaurant.",Bad,Bad,
"The place is located in a nice place, service was ok but not great. Drinks are between $18-$20 dollars. And the food is pricyüòÅ",,Good,Good
"This is a deceiving review as the food was indeed very nice but it was WAY overpriced....like over the top.  Three glasses of a rose, three caprese salads and then shared an octopus salad and a crab salad.  No problem, I know it will be pricey, but somehow when the cheque came it was $435.50 before tip.  That is seriously ridiculous.",Bad,,
We happen to just past by and decided to have lunch here.  The food was excellent and it made us feel like we were back in Italy which was great.  But the tables are very tight and the price was shocking.  We had ordered our meal from the specials that the waiter told us which had no pricing and even though I can imagine it would not be a cheap lunch the main course was $150 (that's one dish for one person) I felt they should have at least told us that considering the menu had dishes that were only up to around $50.  Even the appetizer from the special was overpriced for $40 each plate for a small burrata.  I don't mind paying for Good but I felt this way too expensive for a lunch that was not expected.,Bad,,
"Nello, has a great location ...very chic and a fairly wide menu. The service as well as the food is good.  Now, as to pricing, that is a different story, especially the ""wine by the
glass"" which is definitely overpriced.",,Good,Good
"This small restaurant appeared to be a local favorite  and we just happened to be walking down Madison Avenue when we spotted it.  Loving Italian cuisine we thought we would give it a try and we were not disappointed. Friendly staff, great food and great service!",Good,Good,Good
"Went for the first time to NY (coming from Belgium, Europe) last week and came to Nello's unplanned with my husband and a friend of ours from NY. Had the best pasta ever!!! (con pecorino √© pepe) I would very much appreciate the recipe (so that I can make it at home for our 6 children, like a real New York Italian Mamma :-) ), for it was really the best spaghetti I ever tasted. Thank you so much for the excellent experience.
It was great Italian fine cuisine and I am very glad we came to Nello's by coincidence. For those yet to visit: be aware that quality and good dining come with a price. 
Nello's is the place to be for refined dining, not for a quick cheap bite.",Good,Good,
"Noisy, ridiculously expensive, rude and arrogant  hostess. So loud you can't talk. Staff was snippy. Not a pleasant experience.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We never tire of this place--consistently Good , excellent service . Not cheap but I suspect their rents would be huge in this location on Madison Avenue . They have been around for a very long time & we will keep coming back .
Squid ink pasta to die for &the grilled calamari also great",Good,Good,Good
"Hadn't been here in a while so stopped by for lunch . Had a wonderful table looking at on the street. Unfortunately a little construction also was out front . We had  2 kir royals which were nice. Barb had a artichoke  salad and I had a 3 peppers gazpacho which was beautiful as well as tasty.  We split the pasta with fresh morrelles . Also delicious. 
Couldn't ask for better people watching or food. 
Since it is about the only Resturant on Madison , it isn't cheap. So expect to pay more becomes of the location .",Good,Good,
"See and be seen...same over the years...... Nello is one of these spaces on Madison Ave to have an excellent glass of wine and chat with regulars that are part of Upper east side social scene.
Plenty of upscale tourism.",Good,,
"One of the best meals we've had in New York, or anywhere. In an upscale neighborhood - the space and service reflect patrons who expect the best with no excuses.
Very expensive so may not be your everyday restaurant but worth it.
Read some negative reviews mostly criticizing the price. If that's your issue, may I recommend Sbarro's.",Good,Good,Good
"On a pretty day, sit outside or at least sit by the Windows.
Pasta and veal are both delicious. Service is prompt and attentive. Elegant ---not sure about all the negative reviews but for an upscale Italian restaurant in upper east side, what does one expect?
A wonderful lunch spot!",Good,Good,Good
"We love Nello! The pastas created to order are delicious, and I love the langoustines! You can always count on a fine dining experience here! Great service, yummy wine. Definitely The Place for a Bellini !",Good,Good,Good
"Went here after a day of shopping and at first it looked nice, but the experience was bad, loud and noisy music playing, not even Italian and the food was extremely overpriced 50 dollars for an ordinary pasta is to be considered high. Service was bad, in a way very routinely. Will definitely not go back and would advise anybody else to pick another Italian as there are many of them and with much better food and service.",Bad,Bad,Bad
The service was slow and the food was mediocre. Pasta on both dishes not fresh pasta and rather aldente. Restaurant issue with card payments caused embarrassment and was handled loudly in the middle of the restaurant. Best part of the experience was leaving,Bad,Bad,Bad
This place takes your breath away with its pretentious atmosphere and overpriced food.  I have never been to a place that extracts so much money from diners and delivers so little in return.,Bad,Bad,
"I have to admit I've been coming to Nello for years when I am in NYC - only because it is close to shopping.  This year I was reminded that every time I go it is a huge disappointment.  Certainly fun people watching as the rich and famous seem to be stuck in the same rut I am!  But this year, the service was very slow  - we ordered grilled vegetables which were cold; the eggplant was not at all cooked.  When we asked about it - the matre di - said - ""that's how we serve it"" - end of story.  I vow to break my lazy habit of going to this well located and extremely over-priced restaurant!  Next year - it's Fred's at Barney's much better food and great service.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Strolling around the Upper East Side on Christmas Day, I came across Nello and decided to pop in for a drink. 
It's quaint ambience ensured a very relaxed time. 
As we were eating later that night we only popped in for a quick drink.
The champagne we bought was beautiful but very expensive.
Staff were friendly and accommodating.
I'd certainly go back to Nello to sample their cuisine, just be warned, you'll need the equivalent  of a small african nation's GDP to eat here! 
Would recommend!",Good,Good,Good
"My wife and I (we live in Greenwich Village) found ourselves on the UES and stopped-into Nello for an impromptu lunch.  The food was very good.  The service was very good.  The ambience was very pleasant.  We had a delightful time, quite honestly.  For what we ordered, however, the bill was enormous - - $600.  The undisclosed prices of the specials and the wines by the glass really jacked-up the bill.  Frankly, they were ridiculously expensive.  Now, can I afford $600 for lunch for two people?  Luckily, I can.  Do I wish to pay $600 for such a lunch?  Of course I don't.  
The UES really is a different world.  Apparently it's common up there.  Fair enough.  But, IF we ever go back, we will stick to ordering a la carte.  It's a ""beautiful people"" kind of place, for sure.  Although my wife is very beautiful, I'm not very pretty at all.  I think we'll stick to the Village, SoHo and other points south of the UES.",,Good,Good
"Get ready for an expensive but fabulous lunch. wouldn't suggest having dinner, pretty sleepy at that time. But lunch...what a scene!",Good,Good,
"As you'll see in other reviews, Nello is a high-end restaurant, and it's quite expensive. But the food was wonderful, the service was spiffy and the ambience was lovely. We happened upon it as we walked with our daughter on Madison Avenue and took a sidewalk table. Our waiter suggested prosecco, a Bellini or a mimosa (there were three of us so we got one of each). Our meal choices were fresh, inventive combinations with great seafood, pasta and salads - delightful! My daughter's calamaretti (squid stuffed with seafood) was particularly special. Is it a good choice for budget-minded travelers? No. But we thoroughly enjoyed Nello, and the prices were right on the menu for us to see and decide for ourselves. It was probably a one-time experience for us, but the small restaurant was filled with obvious regulars who enjoy fine dining and Good in an upscale setting on the Upper East Side.",Good,Good,Good
"The bread is below average, pasta over cooked . food is average but priced at Michelin star restaurant. We hv ordered the Pasta, salad n steak for 2. Not worth it!",Bad,Bad,
"My wife and I and a group of friends spent New Year's Eve at Nello.  What a GREAT 
time.   The restaurant was decorated for the holidays and for NYE   The staff at this restaurant are outstanding even on crazy busy night like NYE.  The food was very good.  Highly recommend the lobster  ravioli as well as the Prosciutto and Barata.  The entertainment was unique--Gianni Russo of God Father fame and his band entertained the crowd for the evening.  They were great.  
I read many of the reviews of this restaurant and all stated the place was over priced   They may be right but keep in mind that this is NYC and you get what you pay for and I felt the cost was well worth the benefit.  Quality of the food and the service were very good.  A great night!",Good,Good,Good
"Wow I can't believe I payed that much for such mediocre food. I'm incredibly disappointed, was hoping to get an authentic Italian meal and I got the opposite.",Bad,Bad,
"We had a flight to catch and needed lunch and Nello was right there, looked fun, so in we went.  Probably should have looked at a menu first as the prices are pretty astronomical, even for NYC.  The location is very central, in the midst of bustling shopping, the other diners were quite a well dressed and attractive bunch.  The food was tasty.  My husband paid the bill, I didn't even want to ask.  Pretty sure my daughter's pasta was over $35, plain chicken breast with some greens was $42.  We were there around 2:00pm, were a few open tables, still felt a little cramped.  Next time I will find somewhere else because the price just isn't justified, you can get tons of great italian food, atmosphere and location in NYC for a lot less $$.",,Bad,
I'm blown away by how expensive it is. They mark up the prices way to much and it is not great food either. We paid 200 for wine that is really 40 dollars,Bad,,
On first look it was a quaint Italian restaurant with a great staff however that was the best it got. Food was ok but defiantly not worth the 1000$ tab my family of 6 had to pay absolutely ridiculous.,Bad,Bad,Good
"This restaurant may offer decent food but it's way over priced. So over priced that it's a good idea to avoid. 25 dollars for a small salad. 65 dollars for a steak. 45 dollars for a normal pasta dish. It's not worth the price to me, but if you have money to blow, go for it!",Bad,,
The place to see and be seen. Food was good nothing crazy but very expensive. Hang out with celebs and hedge fund managers.,Good,Good,
"This is the best ƒ∞talian in NY City.Food quality,service and atmosphere is definetely unbeatable!ƒ∞ have been most of the ƒ∞talian restaurants in town but Nello is surely different spot to get the value of your money!Management is excellent so do food!Make a reservation and go smart!Enjoy.",Good,Good,Good
"Our waiter decided we needed to punished for ordering a small order of soup, and assumed we would not be taking our option on the balance of the meal. Completely ignored us after the soup was served, despite us trying to gain his attention while serving adjacent tables. He remarkably did finally see a waiving credit card, blamed the dessert server for not noticing our empty idle table for 20 minutes. Arrogant, aggressive and condescending service. At least the manager apologized.",,Bad,Bad
Fantastic intimate restaurant in heart of NYC.  It's quite expensive but beautiful food in its simplest.  We had starters and mains all fish and were not disappointed,Good,Good,
"Everyone should know by now that the prices are staggeringly expensive, but I have to say that it is a very enjoyable spot for lunch. Try and get a table near the front so you can watch the people go by.  Food is good...service is usually very good. It's more entertainment than fine dining, but I have always had a good meal and try to go every time I am in New York. 


I understand the comments about the prices, but I always seem to come back for more. Kind of a tradition in a way.",Good,Good,Good
"We have always made a point to dine at Nello's for lunch while in NYC, but we have finally allowed common sense to overcome our foodie tendencies. No more Nello for us. We got to where we felt a sense of being taken advantage of and the staff and management laughing all the way to the bank. We understand NYC is expensive and are willing to pay if we feel the meal was really worth it, but we do not feel this way about Nello.",Bad,,
"When I got there I did not realize how much it cost.  After I ordered  drinks I realized. Evern though I did not relize the cost. The food was good and they made fuss over me.
 So ended up not being a rip off. I left my cridit card there but they had it the Next Day I went to pick it up.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We went in for morning coffee and the waiter suggested some cake to go with it, we'll why not we thought. Oh dear I wish we hadn't.  No menus were presented the waiter  suggested apple strudel to which we said yes please. The portions were tiny and I don't have a big appetite, the coffee was below average and the cups so small evenue by English standards. 


The waiters have a severe case of arrogance and clearly believe they are too good to be there. Whilst sitting at the table (which they showed us too) i was hit in the back of my chair three times by waiters moving furniture.


The restaurant itself is in need of a lick of paint, everything looks drab and we noticed the hygiene rating had had a no smoking sign placed in front of it, coincidence or trying to hide something??


A trip to the ladies toilets was umm interesting. The door was locked so I waited, and waited and waited...10 minuts later a male member to staff came out (yes I was at the ladies, not the gents, I double checked) and it would appear from the flooded basin that he had been doing his laundry. While I had been waiting many men had come out of the gents so it wasn't like it was out of order.


On return to our table my mother had gone somewhat pale. Two tiny slices of strudel and two miniature coffees had totalled $64.


We later learnt that Nello's is the place to be seen. Why? New York has hundreds if not thousands of much better places. 


Needless to say I don't recommend!",Bad,Bad,Bad
Sofisticated ambience and great service. Price is on tht high side but food was very good. Some of the soecials can be very costly so ask for the price! Pasta was delicious!,Good,Good,Good
"Nello is for you if you're not a ""foodie"" and are mainly interested in people watching but you better have money to burn or a big expense account because the prices will blow you away. My client took me there recently for a business lunch. He hadn't been there before and wanted to try it. He gasped when he read the menu prices. I said I'd be happy to get up and leave but he said no...I suspect he would have been too embarrassed. That probably happens to many customers judging by the many one and two star reviews. Anyway, you should skip this place. If you want a classy place with great food in this area, simply walk one block East to the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue.",Bad,Good,
"Very clubby, inclusive if you are a ""real"" cognoscenti of the scene, with food being secondary---yet quite tasty, just not memorable. Entertainment on (some) Thursday evenings which is a throwback, but fun and something different.Not a place to look for value, though.",Good,Good,
For quite some time  I have passed this restaurant and always wanted to try it. This past weekend while visiting NY my husband and I stopped there for lunch. The service was terrible. The waiter was rude and the food while extremely overpriced was average at best. Waste of money. Never would I go there again,Bad,Bad,Bad
"a lovely dinner but oh so expensive, no matter how good the food.  at some point they cannot keep this price without a step change in the experience which is tired.",Bad,Good,
I used to go here more frequent years ago but actually got a bit upset one time I was overcharged for a Special White Truffle pasta learning that they did not offer homemade fresh pasta I was annoyed with my bill. But truth is Nello has a great location in Madison Av and when shopping around this area is right in the center. It is always busy here but sometimes I find the crowd a bit  too much!!! But is nice sometimes around spring...,Bad,Good,
too expensive for very average food. Pastas are ridiculously priced. Menu selection is extensive but staff is so arrogant that it detracts from any ambiance.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"Its not the prices --which are the same as the GDP of a small country--its the arrogant attitude and bill padding that goes on. i won't even discuss the food because most of the guests are too large or dull to notice one way or the other. The only person who will steer you towards this place, will be the person not paying the bill. You have been warned: stay away.",,Bad,Bad
"My daughter and I were looking for a nice spot to have a quick lunch before our flight home from NYC and this looked perfect..  The manager was very nice and found us a great table outside.  When I looked at the menu I was very surprised to see the prices. I would have gotten up, but just couldn't after asking for the table..  My daughter had a tiny caeser salad for 28.00 and I had a tuna tartar appetizer for 45.00.  The real clencher was when the water asked if we would like still water or mineral and I said oh just still meaning tap‚Ä¶  when the bill came there was a charge of 15.00 for our one bottle of water, it just didn't feel right.  Spending over 100.00 for a quick bite just felt wrong.  How I had wished that I would have given it to the nice performers on the subway instead.. Lesson to be learned always ask to see a menu before sitting down at a restaurant in a prime location...",Bad,Good,Good
"Terrible prices...for 5 persons we pay 1460 dollars...this is without tips...these guys believes that they have 3 michelin stars...food was good...when we want to order a bottle of wine...Surprise...the price start from 180  dollars...we order that bottle , but the waiter...with a superior attitude said ""we don't have!""...the second choice was 230 dollars...he said again: we don't have...ans suggest me to take one bottle with 270...I took one...It was the first and the last visit in that place",Bad,Bad,Bad
Most expensive lunch on Madison Avenue but great food and people watching.  Great pastas and champagne.,Good,Good,
"The volume of ""overpriced"" reviews would seem like a turnoff to many, but it doesn't leave the restaurant empty.  For a restaurant to be in the same place in NYC for I think about 25 years, they must be doing something right.  I'll grant that it's a fair criticism to say the food may not entirely match the prices, but it's Lenox Hill and not out of line with the neighborhood.  If you want food on a budget, go to the west side.


The staff, for those that know them anyway, are very friendly and helpful, and we have always found the food to be good.  We may not drink wine, but they have a very impressive wine list for those that do.  For those that care about it, they get their fair share of celebrity diners.  The outdoor tables are the most popular, though we like the quieter space in back without the passers-by.",Good,Good,Good
The food was good but totally overpriced. I wouldn't recommend it for that reason. It's not only expensive but the portions are smaller than in Italy. Bottle of Aqua Panna $15. Espresso $8. Desserts  $25. Then there is tax and service. Just be fore warned.,Bad,,
"We had dinner, our dishes: carpaccio, vitello tonato, prosciutto e melone, gnocchi.All very good, delicious and prepared properly. Service was fast and courteous.They really know how to prepare a Negroni.The setting is nice and not pretentious. They should lower their prices by 25 %, but it is Madison Av between 62 and 63rd!",Good,Good,Good
"the location and atmosphere is great. It is expensive no doubt so is New York, just add up the total what you order, you won't have any regrets. Sometimes you pay for who is sitting on the next table.",Bad,Good,
"Without a doubt the most expensive lunch my wife and I have ever had!  It's too bad we didn't read the other reviews in advance because it's true...the food is ok, the atmosphere nice, but nothing is worth the price you pay here!  $200 for 3 appetizers and 3 drinks!  Outrageous!",Bad,Good,
"Well - you cannot fault this place for it's location. Right in the heart of Madison. As for the meal - quite ordinary and completely true to original Italian recipes. The cook forgot to put eggs in the spaghetti carbonara - or is it simply that he thought a novel recipe would be more up-to-date? Whatever, I won't order one if there is a next time. The mains were enough to persuade us that we didn't need a desert. Couldn't get put of the place quick enough.",Bad,Bad,
"We ended having lunch in this restaurant, as were walking back from the Met to our hotel looking for a place to eat. The sitting was nice, and the service good. But the prices seemed little high, but I understood that it was due to the location (Madison Ave.). By the dishes' description, I really expected a very good kitchen and chef. Reality is that they were good, but not that good for a bill of 340 USD for a dinner for two. Do not get me wrong, I have seen dinners on that amount, but they did not feel expensive as the food was excellent, memorable, and service was top of the line. Here the issue is that none were up to that standard.",Bad,Good,Good
Otherwise be prepared to spend an exorbitant amount of money for mediocre food and drinks and sleazy waiter service. They completely rip you off here. We spent >$250 here for dinner for 2 (without drinks!) and had no idea what we got ourselves into until the bill came. The tiny appetizers cost in the neighborhood of $20-30 each and the entrees ran us $60-70 each! Coming here was absolutely crazy. Please save yourselves the time and money and go elsewhere in the city!,Bad,Bad,Bad
"I enjoy their pasta when I have a load of extra money to blow on a lunch, after
shopping on Madison Avenue. Pretentious and expensive, but always delicious.
It's a good choice when you want to sit outside and breath in the fumes from the exhausts of the fancy cars parked right next to you.",Good,,
"We were here couples looking for late afternoon lunch outside to enjoy the spring weather.  We should have looked at the menu first and we should have left as soon as we opened the menu.  Very pushy servers became snooty when we asked for tap water and no wine to start.  We all had pasta course and the table shared two appetizers.  With two bloody Mary's, the bill came to $200 per couple!   Complete rip off!  Oh - and must mention they forgot to put any filling in the raviolis! 
Would give it zeros if possible.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I have never felt so ripped off in all my life $48 for a carbonara and it was pure rubbish.
Do not eat at this restaurant there are far better places at a third of the price and the staff wont be ignorant.",Bad,Bad,Bad
We were 4 people everyone had main dish only 2 starters and 2 dessert and only one botel of wine toscano total amount 2330$ .we were shocked ....the waiter just bring the wine without mentioning prices ......fregatura ..ladriiiiii.vergognia....they should mention the prices after he presented his bottle because he never showes any menu to indicate prices which he never did.vergognia...,Bad,,Bad
"My wife and I decided to stop late afternoon for a drink and coffee. One glass of prosecco (not very good @ $22) and an espresso (good @ $8). Total $32 plus tip. I know it is NY, but seriously?",Bad,,
"You can eat way better in a real italian restaurant in Italy, for 1/5th of the price. I'm not joking. This place is an absolutely, unbeliavable joke.",Bad,,
"I was invited by friends for dinner at Nello's.  We were five at the table, shared starters and each had a main course.  We shared two bottles of wine.  Total bill: $1350.  YES, you are reading correctly.  I have NEVER felts so horribly cheated.  There is simply no excuse for this, given the food we ate.  The wine totalled $300, so you might imagine that we ate truffles or other exotic food.  No, normal Italian dishes.....no gold dust or anything else to justify the price.


Food was good, service average.",Bad,,
"This is the third time I have eaten at this Madison Avenue see and be seen venue.  I knew it was expensive, but decided to splurge for the atmosphere. This time the welcoming maitre'd was more like a barker, pulling us in from the street.  It seemed as if we didn't really need a reservation.   The service was great, but my meal extremely disappointing.I ordered fresh black truffles on noodles for a whopping $130.00 surcharge.  I know.  Serves me right in a way, but if you love truffles, you just might consider it for a special occasion. The noodles were watery and poorly sauced ( I had to ask for salt and butter and worst of all the truffles were WET. ) They should always be shaved on top of the pasta, and not be cooked.  When I complained, they informed me that it was the steam from the noodles that had cooked the truffles and they did shave some more over the top.  I cannot prove it, but I think the truffle was frozen and/or old.  It simply did not have extraordinary flavor one comes to expect from the best specimens at the highest price.  Everything else was fine here, but it is very very overpriced.  Go somewhere else and buy yourself a nice new wallet with the money you have saved.  You are sure to find a nice one on Madison Avenue!

"first  price maybe higher then most customer use to but remember its location is on upper east side on madison and next to hermes store. .any dinner meal  will coat over $100. per person.
now the review. the restaurant is small and cozy. the waiter was nice. I started with Chicken Soup with panna breadsticks. main dish carbonapa noodles made with cream and small bits ham. drink 2 coke total with tip $125.00
overall good ambience  services and food. if you question about price or on budget  then don't come in.",Good,Good,Good
It would be good if we read the reviews about this place before we were stopped here. Two coffees and two bottles of water (because waiter bring us two bottles insted two glasses) for $58 !!! Good thing we were not hungry...,Bad,,
"I wrote a review for here recently and noticed a typo in my review. It seems I am unable to edit it, so I guess I'll post here. I originally said ""I wish I could give it one star"". I feel obligated to point out that I meant to say ""no stars"", as I was forced to give it one star. I don't think that needed clarification, as it was clearly an error, but I felt obligated to correct myself.",,Bad,
"My wife and I were meandering on Madison Avenue and decided that Nello's looked like a great place for a nice lunch.  A nice lunch?  Outrageous prices even for NYC.  Bottled water at $22/bottle.  A glass of Proseco for $20.  Lobster salad for $69.  A modest lunch for two (one glass of Proseco, two bottles of water, a bowl of soup, salad) for $200?  To be fair, the food was excellent and the service was solid.  Very pretentious.  NYC is full of wonderful restaurants.  This is over the top.  Just read the review in the New York Times and that will help persuade you to find another venue for a nice lunch!",Bad,,Good
"My friend and I stopped in one Friday in early December for lunch, with no reservation to give it a try after shopping even though we both remembered hearing how bad it was even though the ""swells"" from abroad kept it going.  Was told ""it's fine.  We'll find a place for you.""  The place had at least fifteen open tables at 1:30.  Ridiculous place.  Excessively expensive.  Endured a misogynistic staff and a couple of regulars that flirted (badly) with us, asking if we had husbands, boyfriends or, wait for it, were we a couple?  Two woman at lunch or dinner doesn't remotely mean we are looking for men.  And just plain lousy food.  Angel hair pomodoro for something approaching $30?  Please!  Honestly, over $20 for a vodka tonic???  Realizing that the rumblings we had heard about the pricing were true, we chuckled and had fun with each other reading on her iPad the reviews from NY Times and others.  Oh dear...!  STAY AWAY!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The decor of the restaurant was beautiful, warm and inviting. We looked at the menu, and although it looked a bit overpriced, we decided to give it a try. The portions were VERY small, and therefore did not warrant the high price. BUT, what really annoyed me was the prices of things like to soda and dessert. A diet coke was $10 and the small piece of Tiramasu was $21. My bill was  $425 for four people who split appetizers and entree's. It's a joke, those prices should not be allowed. These restaurants need to be regulated especially around the Holidays‚Ä¶..",Bad,Good,
"We went there for  lunch . Very nice Christmas decoration. 
I had the carciofi alla romana . ( artichokes Roman style in olive oil and lemon. ) 
They were absolutely delicious , BUT  there were only 3 tiny ones for ... 28 dollars ... 
Overall the foid is good the service is very nice but frankly really overpriced . 
For two , no wine , no desert , no truffles  we pait 230 dollars ... 
But the restaurant was fulland it is upper East side , so maybe i the price is not so important .",Good,Good,Good
"A store manager recommended this place to us. When we walked in, it seemed very busy, loud and definitely happening. Prices on the menu showed to be extremely high, but we decided to give it a shot. We took the waiters recommendation and ordered the today special. We have traveled all over the world and don't mind paying, if the food and service justifies it, but this was outrages and service was poor on top of it. It's a shame we felt obligated to tip the 20%, even though that was based on food pricing, not service or quality. I would never recommend this!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We went to Nellos which was booked by friends.
Service was slow and one of the mains black cod was delivered 35 minutes after the other main courses.
This was despite asking the head waiter where it was.
One fish dish was served cold so it had to be sent back.
The food quality was average and not worth the price .
When I got the bill there were some mistakes .
Hot water was charged as tea
at $7.50!
I complained to the head waiter about the very slow service he said he was sorry.
I requested he did something so he reluctantly removed the black cod from the bill.
Avoid .",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We Walked by this restaurant last Sunday around 3 and I said to my husband let's stop there it looks beautiful.  The large live Christmas wreaths with berries on the walls and fresh tulips on the tables! Perfect Service - The food was so great that we ate there for dinner two nights later and at Harry's Cipriani the next night and my Lobster Salad was a 10 in presentation - a ton of lobster meat and perfect! Next I had Veal Piccatina or veal picatta - it was soooo good and I had that same dish at Cipriani two nights later but this was a ten - the other a 7. The Simi Cab by the glass is very nice - the Lobster Bisque my husband had twice - fantastic like the salad. The woman next to us lives in DC and NYC and said her Dover Sole with Asparagus was fantastic as well. My Cappuccino and chocolate dessert great.  I photographed the menu it was so good! In NY you get what you pay for in this fine restaurant - top food and service BOTH at lunch and then at dinner,",Good,Good,Good
"The 5 star service to the delicious daily specials to the cool, chic crowd.  Makes this one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city.",Good,Good,Good
"I really don't know where to start. I was in the city with my mother and since it was pouring rain, I was unable to do any restaurant research on my phone, so we just walked into a restaurant when we got hungry enough. It started out decently; they asked us if we had a reservation (and said it was fine that we didn't [there was a bit of a lull]), took our coats, and we were seated and given menus. It was downhill from there.


In that part of New York high prices are expected. But for prices this high, everything should be exceptional, and that was not the case. Some of the waiters were fine, but one stood out as terrible. He seemed older than the others. He took my wine order, but was very unhelpful. Plus he was rude to my mother as we were leaving. I'm recently 21 (but don't worry, they don't card) and I don't know much about wine yet. I asked him about chardonnay and he said that it's good. Well, that really doesn't tell me anything. I asked if it's sweet. He said yes. I would expect an Italian restaurant to be a bit more descriptive than that. Little Italy is much better. The waiters in Little Italy are so friendly, the food is delicious, portions are good, prices are reasonable. But unfortunately I wasn't in the area that day. So I got stuck at this cleverly disguised dump.


The food portions were outrageously small. I ordered the ravioli (which I believe was over $40. Maybe $43?) And I got like 5 or 6 ravioli. They were stuffed, but you could barely tell. My mom got the portobello salad which came with one rather thin mushroom and some lettuce. It was also drastically overpriced (I think it was $27). The food was good, but I would never recommend going there. If you're in the city on a day trip walking around the entire day, you need more food. We really didn't care that it was so expensive, but the poor service and minuscule portions are just inexcusable.


Anyway, we both got something more to eat at a cafe in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. And if I could go back to that day, I would have had one lunch just at the met. New York would be an even greater place if this place would close. Tourists visiting for the first time would probably be left with bad feelings about the city when really there are great restaurants if you do some research. I would give Nello's one star if possible. Sadly, I am forced to give them one star, which I do not feel that they earned. This experience was just unacceptable.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"My husband and I had lunch here recently.  The atmosphere is lovely, and the service great.  The food was exceptional.  I had lobster ravioli with crab meat in a homemade tomato sauce- so delicious!  However, at 75 dollars, I felt it  was a bit too expensive, especially for lunch.  If money is no object, then you will not be disappointed.",Bad,Good,Good
"As most other reviewers have said, the food was very good.  Servings were moderate.  Service was excellent.  However, the prices are very high.  Veal Chop with mushrooms was very good but costs $99.",Good,,Good
The pasta with shaved white truffles was ethereal. The veal chop unbelievable. Loved Nello's photographs of wild animals on the walls. Warm atmosphere.,Good,Good,
"I agree with other TripAdvisor reviewers that the price level at Nello's is a total rip-off. The food, service or general atmosphere doesn't justify the prices.  
The restaurant has a good atmosphere, great decor. The guests have a good time and the noise level is quite high thanks to intense dinner conversations. The music sound level on a Saturday evening is too high for my taste as it is a little bit difficult to hear what your fellow guests across the small tables are saying. 
We had risotto with porcini mushrooms. Really great, but not worth USD 75 per person. The desserts are beautiful and really tasty except for the gelified pannacotta.",Bad,Good,
"We've stumbled upon Nello on our last day in the last visit to NY. Not knowing anything about it, it just seemed to be a cute little place to have lunch. It was very packed, we got a table at the sidewalk, but it was a bit cold outside. We accepted the table outside granted to be moved to a table inside as soon as one was free, said our waiter. Little did we know this is a hip place and all these trophy-wives needed tables after their shopping sprees throughout manhattan... So our cozy table never came... The food was really good but the prices were insane. The waiter suggested an entree of 55 dollars - the price only came on the check -, made of common mushrooms (no truffles added) and polenta. The expresso was 9 dollars. There were no wines under 110 dollars on the menu. They don't hand out a desert menu, they bring this beautiful tray of possibilities and you just choose one, not knowing it would cost at least 20 dollars. So, all in all, lunch for 2 ended up costing more than 400 dollars. The food was very good, but we were tricked into taking expensive contours to our meal and eating in a freezing table, even though we were paying the same shiny dollars as the flashy prized people inside. You know what, NY has got a whole lot of really great places with great food that treat you better. So, let those prized women have this place all to herselfs and spend all of their husband's money on ridiculously priced coffe. I would definetely not recommend it.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Today we had lunch with 2 adults and 1 child and picked up a tab for $ 250,00. They offer you water and then charge it at $ 9,00 for half a liter. My son had a coke. They charge $ 10,00 for a glass of coke, no refill and from the gun, not even a small bottle. The food is good, our waiter mediocre. If you pretend to be an upscale restaurant the service should be exquisite and check up on your guests to see if they are doing all right. None of this happened. The place is pretentious without the means to back it up. So if you want to spend a lot of money for almost nothing this is definitely the place to be.",Bad,,
This place is overrated and overpriced. We had carciofi alla romana and 3 piatti di pasta and i don't know what was worst. I don't even wanna explain what was wrong with the meals. With one bottle of wine and 3 espresso we paid for this dinner same price that we paid two days before in one 2 michelin stars restaurant. I am just sorry that I haven't checked before trip advisor reviews  as we just stumbled at this restaurant on our way and it looked nice. That is it. It just looks nice. Waiters didn't care and food is a joke.Just don't go.,Bad,,Bad
"While we appreciate fine meals and consider ourselves foodies, this spot was grossly overpriced for the cuisine. We ordered the ravioli entree for lunch and the waitress casually remarked if we wanted the cheese or the lobster... Choosing the lobster, we were greatly surprised to find it priced on our tab as $75. Ridiculous. Snooty ma√Ætre-d who asked if we had a reservation in the late afternoon in a half-empty restaurant. Dirty wine glasses... Rather disappointing. We should have checked the abundance of other trip advisor reviews that warned us about this spot. Avoid.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Nello' sis my favorite place in world. Every time I am landing in NY I just can't wait to go for lunch and spend 2 fantastic hours.
Restaurant is beautiful with little nice tables on the best part of Madison Avenue. Always decorated with nice flowes on the table and at the bar where you will start you fantastic lunch with a good glass of wine. The wine list is unbelievable but I love to have rose when I am here. 
Service is great, everybody kind and efficient even when the restaurant is fully , and if frequently happen because this is the best place to be!
As a started the carciofi salad with fresh parmigiano and avocado, with truffle oil is just heaven! The 3 color gazpacho is unique! Pasta dishes are fantastic specially with melanzane. Pasta with truffle is just unforgettable. Fish is always very fresh and cooked perfectly. There is nothing better that a meal at Nello's in NY. Have been here several times and always exceeded my expectations 
Strongly recommended",Good,Good,Good
"Be prepared to spent $250+ for lunch for two to eat in this Italian establishment in New York City for the Upper East Side super wealthy and those who enjoy their company.  I'm of the latter and every time my husband and I are in NYC we have to have one lunch there. We always sit by the open windows to see who's coming in and who's walking on Madison Avenue.  I order the same thing all the time - Ossobuco (braised veal shank).  It's huge and delicious.  When eating at Nello's you have to apply the cost to the food and the atmosphere which is part of the price. I'm sure some of the items on the menu are better than others but, for the most part we have been happy with our meals. One thing that we found quite strange was that all the old Italian waiters have been replaced by Chinese? It seem out of place.",Good,,
"I stopped for lunch with my daughter . We start with green salad and carpaccio , for main lobster ravioli with tomato sauce +2 glass of white wine and deserts for two - the food was fresh and tasty but not worth the 445 us$",Bad,,
"TripAdvisor, please provide the option of a ZERO star rating because ""one star"" implies that there is any redeeming quality in Nello's. There's none here. This is what you get for the most expensive pasta in New York here: sub-quality, soggy, tasteless, hole in your wallet or purse, often snooty and inattentive staff, etc. The other dishes ordered by my visiting guests were just as bad. Crime has declined so much in NY City since Mayor Giuliani's (and Bloomberg) crime-fighting administration that NY today is one of the safest large city in the world, if not the safest. However, beware of the figurative ""daylight robbery"" by such establishments. As they say in NY, they have to chutzpah to charge exorbitant prices for bad attitude, lousy service and subpar food.


There are many other better and less expensive choices in the neighborhood on or off Madison Avenue: Caravaggio, Bar Italia, Via Quadronno, Il Mulino, Salumeria Rosi, Morini on Madison, Antica Bottega del vino.  That's just Italian. There are many French options. Just ask Siri on your iPhone, or your Android can help as well.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Its amazing that where I ate the worst in NY is also the most expensive!
I felt cheated!! I was expecting an amazing meal but was very very disappointed! 
I guess people come here for the celebrity sightings because its definetely not for the 50 dollar pasta plate.",Bad,,
"We had lunch at Nello's.  I completely agree with most reviewers here... The food is OK but really nothing to write home about (I've had a better Caesar salad at Outback) .  Prices are over the moon and NOT representative of the quality of meal.  Staff was nice enough until we told them we wanted a quick bite, then they looked down their noses at us... despite the Jimmy Choo and bags in our possession.  The place just reeks of sleaze.
Do yourself a favor.... Don't go.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Food was good, but not extraordinary. The rely heavily on promoting dishes with truffles which of course are extremely expensive. The restaurant is very nicely decorated an d the service is good. The truffles are amazing but we had a little too many, in the carpaccio, in the pasta, etc. The Dover Sole was very good, but less than what I expected for the price. I am aware we were not careful at ordering and went too far with the truffles, but the bill left me speechless. More than 800 dollars for three for lunch.
Anyway a nice experience but not to be repeated. Be careful with the truffles.",Bad,Good,
"We had some nice dinner at this restaurant. The staff was very friendly, had a good way for ""upselling"", especially with the nice desserts haha. The food is very nice, we enjoyed very much. It is recommended that you do not care too much about the price, as it turned out to be rather expensive. But hey, if you have the chance to see Beyonce having dinner as well, who cares??",,,Good
"My review of this restaurant is very similar to the New York Times Restaurant Reviewer, Sam Sifton. So I'll quote from his review published April 13, 2010: ""It was after 10 on a Tuesday night, and the dining room was empty save for a table of four people finishing a collection of wan Italian food that, with a few glasses of wine, would cost them $593.37 before tip....Diner food at Champagne prices, one said."" ""Nello, which opened in 1992, is an ecosystem that is almost incomprehensible to those not a part of it. The food is not very good. Yet the restaurant‚Äôs customer base is built of the richest and most coddled people in the city, who love it for its elegance and, perhaps, simplicity."" ""The table of four that night was made up of that latter group: New Yorkers relatively new to the restaurant, unknown to the management. 


They ate crisp artichokes offered as carciofi alla giudia. These tasted of shirt cardboard. They ate sawdusty chicken livers lashed with balsamic. They sipped at lentil soup familiar to anyone who owns a can opener and shared too-salty saffron risotto, correctly yellow, of no particular flavor. 


They gummed at cannelloni with mushrooms that from the grit on them might actually have been harvested wild, as well as at rubbery swordfish drenched in mustard sauce, then laughed about lobster ravioli so tasteless it might have been prop food for an advertisement. Only an arugula salad with fontina and pears could have been mistaken for something good to eat.""  ""The restaurant‚Äôs best dish by far is tagliolini with butter, truffle oil, shards of black truffle and Parmesan. It costs $100. If that is no matter, the pasta is extremely buttery and delicious."" ""If you desire more than a lemon-scented salad and don‚Äôt want to spare the $100 for the pasta with truffles, the best bet is a simple bowl of green and white tagliatelle served with prosciutto, green peas, Parmesan and pecorino. Not bad, if very rich. (And $38!) This is food for children raised in boarding schools. 


Vitello tonnato, meanwhile, looks good enough straight from the kitchen. It tastes like sliced shoe, though, against a tuna sauce that carries a Miracle Whip tang. It‚Äôs grim, especially at $32. Rage can overtake a person at Nello: the place is what used to be called a rip. (And the desserts are stale to boot.) But if $32 means nothing to you, if it is the equivalent of the dollar the rest of us can spend on a slice of pizza off Times Square, the restaurant is welcoming and the people-watching is nonpareil. There is nothing snobby about it at all, least of all the food."" I couldn't have said it better my self and that's why he writes for the times and I don't!",Bad,,
"I have been to Nello's for lunch a few times. It was always a very Good. Nice cocktails, great food, attentive staff. Expect to pay around $400 for two without the wine.",Good,Good,Good
"I'm not kidding.  The prices were so high it made me laugh.  Thankfully I was being treated for lunch.  We were a party of 7 and the bill was almost $1000.  There were mothers with children stopping in for a bite and known to the wait staff.  How much does your husband need to make to be a regular here?  I had the special lobster salad (over $50) for my entree and an arugula and pear salad to start ($27.)  For dessert I had the creme brulee.  The food was good, fresh, well seasoned and a filling portion.  Was it college tuition good?  No. For the money it should have been a meal I'll remember the rest of life. The service was almost attentive, fresh pepper came halfway through my salad and my water glass was not refilled.  If you have more money than sense, a face full of Restylane, and a penchant for dressing too young for your age, go for it.",,,
"Went here for lunch and was seated at one of the outdoor tables.  We had a leisurely lunch with amazing ""ugly"" tomatoes and a great pasta dish.  Service was very attentive.  Another couple tried to bribe the waiter to separate our table which would have totally disturbed us.  The waiter said ""absolutely not"" which I respected.  To finish the meal we had the Napoleon, fresh fruit and the creme br√ªl√©e.  The Napoleon was amazing but the creme br√ªl√©e was very eggy and not smooth.  We didn't end up complaining but was surprised.  Maybe they had a summer intern do it!   In any case, rest of the meal and recommended wine were spot on.",Good,,Good
"The restaurant looked interesting from the outside and as we stood by the door we were ushered in by some flashy suit. They suggest for you what you should order before you even see the menu and the shocker is when you see the bill. Lest to say that this was the most expensive worst meal of our lives. Nello's is dishonest, overpriced, a scam and should be closed down.",Bad,Good,Bad
Went to have lunch. I have gone to many nyc restaurants but was shocked to see the price for lunch menu. Ate anyway thinking the food may be fabulous but it was just average. I will not recommend this place to anyone.,Bad,,
"This restaurant is full of chutzpah.  I will admit that the food is good but the prices are out of the stratusphere. $35 for a bowl of soup is a bit much even if it is white asparagus soup.  And $100 for a veal chop which was the special of the day was ridiculous.  There are so many restaurants in NYC that I won't eat there again.  And the music, if you can call it that, was just a very loud pulsing 3 chords.  Zagats comment was ""full of Euro trash"" that have too much money.",Bad,,
"I recently dined at Nello's. Before sitting down the waiter was waving a bottle of French champagne saying have a glass ladies without saying the price. 
The specials were announced without revealing prices. One guest ordered an octopus starter from the specials. When the bill arrived the charge for this minuscule starter was $65 - more expensive than most main courses on the menu and the most expensive dish on the bill.
The 'upselling' was in one's face.
Very expensive and a rip off",Bad,,Bad
"Went to the place for lunch about 2/3 weeks ago with my husband and a couple of friends.   The place in itself is OK, not beautiful, but kind of interesting.  We all found the servers a little pushy with the cocktails of the day but I guess that it is their job.  Now the food was pretty bad ... I asked for the tuna and it was 4 tiny pieces of sashimi  thick tuna on top of a salad that had seen better days and one could tell that it was a pre done plate that was placed in the refrigerator for many hours before being served.   It did not taste like anything.   The price however was as if I had eaten a top notch piece of Tuna served on top of some amazing salad.   Everyone agreed that the food was just ok, not worth the price.   I would recommend to save your money and go anywhere else",Bad,,
"Want to visit a place where Roman Abramovitch left 25 000$ on tips? Go to Nello and not be surprised with a service, the guys there are not very welcome if they don't feel that you can leave them at least 10% of the amount which Roman left em. The food is great but   the service is not so lovely.",Good,Bad,Bad
"We should have known better - no menu at the front door. We asked for a wine 
Iist which was refused so we ha no idea how much we were being charged for a glass of Pinot Grigio and a Barolo to accompany a Saltimbocca and a Fugato.  The food was fine - 3 stars. - but a bill of $300 for the above and two pre - lunch drinks was farcical!  Bullying culture, of both customers and underling staff.  Not nice people!  The regulars seemed to be people with lots of money and no interest in food for eating. A place to be seen but you will be ripped off! Don't go!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We were 9 friends having a short late night snack. The bill ended up being close to 1000$. The food was crap, the drinks were crap and the service was crap. Never again.",Bad,Bad,Bad

"While Nello's is a tried and true classic Italian eatery on the UES, it is ridiculously overpriced. Do not get me wrong: the experience is great, but once is enough. As a New Yorker, I have been to Nello's several times for various gatherings, girls luncheons, etc., but during my visit last week I decided that would be it...for a while. The cuisine is overall good, but not worth $100 + (for lunch!). And the fact that most every time I have been they push adding truffles to all of their dishes is a turn-off. And beware: the truffles add at least an extra $100-200 to your bill. I could fly to France and harvest my own truffles for this price (almost being serious here). And also beware of the champagne they push after being seated. I have also heard many of my friends and colleagues voice irritation over the checked-coat policy during the cold months. Apparently, it is forbidden to keep your coat with you at the table. Weird. 


The interior decor is beautiful, so treat yourself once--but do not be fooled twice.",Bad,Good,Bad
"Though the prices are on the high side this is the second time we have eaten lunch at this restaurant that is open to Madison Avenue.  The food is outstanding matched by very professional service.  The menu is outstanding and the list of specials, recited by memory by the severs, is almost as long as the regular.  We shared two appetizers, and a pasta.  We enjoyed all three thoroughly and left happy and content.  This is a good place to treat yourself.  Don't be swayed by other reviews that are overly critical.  We like it and will return again.",Good,Good,
"You have to say ""Chow"" when you arrive!
I love this place, by myself at the small bar with a glass of wine or with a friend at a cozy 2 top enjoying some antipasto!  Very European on Madison Avenue!  Chow Bello!",Good,Good,Good
"Go here if you enjoy being ripped-off!! Lunch tab of $350+ for 2 consisting of soup, salad and
3 glasses of wine..Oh and a bottle of sparkling water for $15! Food was mediocre at best and
not even hot- wait staff are nothing more than herders for those who get sucked in for eating
here!  All show and no substance- horrible experience!",Bad,Bad,
"This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to.   Horrendously overpriced with really Bad.   You aren't given menus until you have ordered drinks ($15 OJ, $15 water, $37 glass of champagne).  The prices are crazy for the quality of food served!   They really try to push the specials.... Again before the regular menu is given to you.  The specials are all between $100-250!  Though they don't tell you that.
A complete rip-off of a place.   20% service added automatically to bill.   Do not go there.   There is a reason it is currently rated no. 7950 out of 8000 restaurants in NYC.",Bad,Bad,

We enjoyed our meal greatly. Would highly recommend for lunch.",Good,Good,
"Upper East sides best, on Madison where it pays to have a black card.  Celebrities abound but the staff treats everybody like a VIP...excellent Italian food, better atmosphere which makes a cocktail all the better.  Expensive but exquisitely New York...romantic...out of a movie.",Good,Good,Good
Don't walk into this place on a cold night in Manhattan thinking it will be a port in a storm. Overpriced with arrogant service. Food was mediocre at best.,Bad,,Bad
"It is an interesting place, it is open all day long, people coming all the time, you can meet old personalities, funny, everybody talks to you, like a party. The food is traditional but excellent.",Good,,
"Extremely expensive, unworthy. $620 for 3, price of the botle of water $15.... Mafia place. The fault is ours, the waiter was so nice, he came to the table and explained all the menu, without giving us the chance to look at the menu.",Bad,Bad,Good
"I went to dinner with my wife and daughter for my birthday.  The waiter offered champagne, sounded nice.  The brought 3 very small (one glass) bottles of champagne at $37 each.  That was $150 with tax and tip before we started.  We had one appetizer, 3 basic mains from the menu, and 2 basic glasses of wine.  No dessert, no coffee.  It was $400.  They kept hyping us throughout and I kept politely saying no.  We're very sorry we didn't walk out at the beginning.  I feel totally ripped off.  Food was ordinary.",Bad,,
"First of all the restaurant kept the outer door open, so the temperature was really unpleasant. ( very cold ) 


The price is absurdly high.


The food is ok. 


To sum it up, I will never come back.",Bad,Bad,
"I went there on a cold, Monday night when the restaurant was mostly empty. I thought food was good but not spectacular; it was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.  One thing that was irritating is that they kept the outer door open (I presume to encourage more people to enter).  So every time someone left, it was very chilly.  I suppose I could've complained, but I shouldn't have to do something that should be obvious.",,Bad,
"We went to Nello because it was very convenient to our hotel and looked like a quaint little spot decorated nicely for the holidays.  We regretted it as soon as we walked in. The tables are on top of each other, the food is just okay and while I don't mind paying up for a great dining experience, that just wasn't the case here.  You pay for the champagne experience, but you get light beer result.  There are just too many better options in NYC.",Bad,Good,
"While I understand that this restaurant is VERY expensive, the food is outstanding and I don't mind paying for it.  We always get the homemade chicken noodle soup and dover sole.  We have been at this restaurant over seven times and have NEVER had a bad meal OR poor service.


Understand that this is a restaurant on another level; If you are not used to eating in very upscale venues, you may be uncomfortable.  It's a restaurant where you go to see and be seen whilst dining on great food and cocktails.  There is community seating, which many other reviewers find offensive but it works.  The staff, while at sometimes may seem aloof, tend to any and every request you may have.  It definately takes a certain seasoned diner to happy there.


I'll happily shell out the bucks at this establishment again and again!!


P.S.  The flower arrangements are the most spectacular I've seen!",Good,Good,Good
"This Manhattan eatery is probably the most absurdly priced restaurant in the city.... unfortunately the customers are here to be seen and heard and do not care about anything else.Lots of Prada,Gucci,Hermes surrounded by face lifts and other improbable plastic assists.The food portions are miniscule , the menu is Italian but the prices are just in another hemisphere.Be very careful about ordering any pasta with truffles ;Request the price before giving the order.This is the type of place that out of towners walk away and think that NYC is full of expensive eateries and it gives the city a bad name.",,,
"The food was good, but not exceptional and the bill was totally out of sight. The restaurant only had about 4 tables going so they pushed the ""specials"", which sounded good.  We did not ask the price as we don't do that, however, it came out to about $350 - $400 a person and no one had more than a second glass of wine.  We will never go there again as we felt fully taken advantage of and there are so many wonderful places to go in New York.  I have to give service a ""poor"" rating as a result.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Great place to be! Loved the atmosphere, the people. Very good italian food - yes it's pricy - but worth the experience!",Good,Good,
"I'm rating Nello's ""Very Good"" because in fact, it does serve good quality food and service is polished and attentive. But lunch for three (even with two bottles of wine at $250.00 each which would be $125.00 max virtually anywhere else) approaching $1,750.00 (no joke) is just absurd, ridiculous and without peer. NYC has endless great restaurant choices. And while Nello does offer high quality, and its Madison Avenue location is perfect, it takes expensive to another level. Many other great NYC restaurants also serve excellent quality with great service and don't even come close to the ludicrous prices you will pay at Nello. Even for those who can afford it, it leaves one asking why?",Good,Good,Good
"Yes I have To admit this is a pricey place for a simple Italian food...but it s delicious...at least what we had was very good....
the calamari and the risotto is excellent and as well the pastas...
the place is neat and chic...full of classy Russians and middle East ppl...
had a good Saturday late late lunch there...with a high price...so if you re willing to pay for it then do it",Good,Good,
We have been recomended to Nello by very wealth people but I would never imagine to be robbed like that. The food is very good and the service too but it does not justify a bill of 354 usd per person. We had the cheapesr barbaresco in the wine list and a half bottle os white wine for 220 which still leaves a bill of 260 dollars per person! I'm sorry but I dont care spending money in a dinner but this way no chance. Time to close doors or at least get some michellin stara and great food becaus it was ridiculous!,Bad,Bad,
"The service was terrible, a very snob manager. Overpriced! I do not recommend and will never go back. Stay away!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We were walking along Madison Avenue and decided to just have a cup of coffee, and maybe a beer at one of the tables so invitingly placed on the sidewalk. Looked good, the weather was beautiful, the street was abuzz, great location. We ordered two single expressos, a double expresso, a beer and one piece of cake. The charge came for over $95 for the four of us.  I did not realize until I got home that they charged for two double expressos ($30) instead of only one, small piece of cake, very good, I must admit ($21).... just imagine the surprise. I cannot comment on the food, but if you just want to stop by for a drink, a cake, a cup of coffee, forget about it, just pass by and keep your money. Fortunately, we then went to Brooklyn at Vini & Olii in Clinton Hill and had a lovely dinner, with wonderful appetizers, pasta, seafood and two bottles of wine and the total came to $250, for 6 adults and one child. Lovely, low-key atmosphere, quick service, quite affordable and fun. What a difference!",Bad,Bad,
"Stopped in to Nello before a flight back to Asia in AUG 2013.  It was a Saturday and the city had cleared out.  The other diners were very nice, the staff was nice but the food was outrageously priced.  My brother ordered a $100 fish which I'll never let him live down.  Wouldn't go back.",Bad,,
"Excellent service, great menu, even greater wine list. Well worth a visit. I just happened to walk in during a busy Thursday lunch time, was seated in no time, served a drink and some delicious bread sticks to nible on while waiting for my lunch date.",Good,Good,Good
"The restaurant was very crowded and as such resulted in an unusal seating situation.
We were 2 seated at a 4 top. 
Mid way thru our meal a party of 2 was seated at our table.
Given the price of lunch it was not expected.
The food was good although a tad salty.
The restaurant was totally packed.
Seems to cater to people with take selfies.",,Bad,
"Nello definitely lost his appeal, glamour and shine. It became an ordinary Italian restaurant sleeping on his old glory.",,,
"Booked because it was close to our hotel. Should have read Trip advisor first. Two people, two salads, two OK mains (a nice pasta and a simple chicken breast)  a bottle of water and a bottle of Nappa Chardonnay, finished with a cappuccino. $370!!!
We don't mind paying for great food. At Nello we paid more than we had the previous week at Heston Blumenthal' venue at the London Mandarin Oriental. There we had a startlingly great THREE course meal, a cocktail to start, a bottle of great French Chablis topped by professional, friendly service. Nello should be ashamed to think they are in that league. It is, at best, a mediocre neighbourhood Italian eatery not a world class restaurant.",Bad,Bad,
"We had a cup of tea (not a pot), an Americano coffee, no milk and two pastries. We were charged $72.
How is that possible? 
The table next to us nearly died of fright when they got their bill for $250 for one dish of truffle risotto! 
We were out for a walk and thought we would stop for a drink. On returning home we looked at tripadvisor. What a pity we didn't know what a total scam/ripoff this place is before we went.
I telephoned today to complain and the manager wasn't interested.
DO NOT go here. They are thieves in disguise.",Bad,Bad,Bad
My dining experience found over the top prices which were obtained only by asking or discovered at check-out. Dessert were served/suggested for ordering without a price only to be discovered when the check arrived. Suggest that every item be priced before ordering to avoid shock. A lovely location but the business practices are disappointing.,Bad,Good,
I can't say anything good about this experience. Water is poured-and charged- without any discussion. Adding grilled chicken to a salad doubled the price from $21 to $42 dollars!! Requests not conveyed (or respected). Stay away from this tourist trap unless you feel like throwing money away on a subpar meal.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"My boyfriend and I dropped into Nello‚Äôs to treat ourselves to a drink and a pick-me-up in the mid afternoon.


I was offered some champagne upon arriving and accepted. It didn‚Äôt turn out to be a glass but a small bottle (which only contains about two flutes‚Äô worth and would have been fine had the price not been extortionate). My boyfriend got a whiskey sour (which was not made properly, it didn‚Äôt have the egg white this drink requires). We should have noticed their strategy of taking drink orders just as we sat down (they didn‚Äôt bring us the menu so we did not see the prices).


We decided to share a dessert and, again (and quite tactfully) were not shown the dessert menu, just a platter with some desserts to choose from. Ordered a cr√®me brulee and were asked if we would like some fresh berries with it (obviously we didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd be charged for these, let alone the fact that they‚Äôd turn out to be more expensive than the dessert itself). 


This is what the bill (approximately, as this is from memory) came to:
-champagne: $37
-(very average) whiskey sour: $19 
-(also quite average) cr√®me brulee: $22 
-fresh berries: $33 (probably about $5 worth from a supermarket?)
-bottle of (very normal-seeming) water: $20


In sum, the service was only all right. The bathroom was very dirty. We paid near $150. I know it‚Äôs on Madison Avenue‚Ä¶ but still‚Ä¶",Bad,Bad,
This is a nice dinning spot with Good.  However at $14 for a beer and $44 for pasta with minimal meat sauce it is grossly overpriced.,Bad,,
Below average food for extraordinary prices. Example would be charging 50 dollars for an appetizer of Buratta. Also tried to put a 50 dollar tip on my bill without me knowing.,Bad,Bad,Bad
This place must only be for innocent tourists walking down Madison Avenue while they shop and once they get socked with a huge bill are in for a huge surprise.,Bad,,
"The place has flies in it, that means maggots in the kitchen.  The bathroom was dirty.  The waitstaff is terrible and they will push specials like 250 dollar pasta that is not even good by the way and not give any prices.  A cheap Peroni beer is 12.65 and that is a relative bargain here.   The waiters will sometimes add tips to your credit card bills!
This place is for tourists and the ignorant nuevo rich like JAYZ.",Bad,Bad,Bad
We expected a big bill on Madison Ave. for our little family of 4. The Maitre' D was warm & welcomed us in as we walked along the street looking for a nice place to have dinner. This place is really geared towards folks with over a $200k income who are used to & WANT to pay the max for dinner. The place is clean & well appointed. The food was OK -not stellar & our waiter was cold but efficient. The $370.00 final bill was a small shock but i'd expected it as every main course was $49.00 but the shock was the bottle of Stella -$13.00 --gouge! - Creme Brulet-- $22.00 each - my son had sorbet & my daughter a cake  -each $22.00 gouge gouge!!,,,Bad
"It was the lunch time and we passed by this restaurant, so we decided to sit there for a lunch. Prices in the menu are high - do not count on anything below 30$. I acknowledged that and I was expecting to pay ~50$ per person. Well not really...


Waiter suggested to order 'meals of the day' which in our case were: Alaskan Salmon (my husband wanted pasta but he got Salmon appetizer...) and Pasta with Truffles + water. 


When we start eating I was already annoyed as food was terribly disappointing. My husband got wrong dish and my pasta was far from ideal Pasta with Truffles. We were angry before we saw the check. And here it comes...


These two dishes were <drums>: 319.76$. YES. 90$ Salmon (appetizer!!!), 150$ Pasta, 15$ bottle of Water, they automatically add 20% gratitude and of course tax. Total: 319.76$. 


This is the price that you just do not agree with. I went to the manager (yes, I am one of these ;)) and I disagreed to pay that amount of money because:


1. They did not inform us about the pricing of the 'meals of the day'.
2. It was not even good.
3. We got not what my husband wanted (and 'by accident' it was more expensive).
4. It is crazy expensive for what we got.


I have obtained 100$ discount. Yes..., nowadays in restaurants you get 100$ (sic!) discounts...


Total bill after discount was: 219.76$ which I paid but I still think that IT WAS NOT WORTH IT.


Summary: DO NOT GO THERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. Or at least be warned. It is not even good.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We recently stopped into Nello's on Madison Avenue for coffee and water.  We ordered two iced coffee's with Bailys, two cappuccinos and one liter bottle of water. To our dismay when the bill arrived we were floored.  It was $125.01.",Bad,,
"There is no doubt that the location is unbelievably perfect; that more or less says it all! i lived in Italy for 35 years, traveled every region. I have never had a ""pasta alla carbonara"" covered in onions or a ""pasta alle vongole"" covered in lemongrass instead of parsley...the taste was very unusual and unsuitable...the price for 30 grams of pasta was totally unreasonable....but then again, if you are unfamiliar with the true taste of Italia cuisine and need an ego boost, go and blow your money there. The atmosphere is good. It's the first time I have ever questioned a bill! give me a break! If you want true Italia i highly recommend the ""Cipriani in SOHO""...NO comparison at all.",Bad,Good,

This place is more in the style of St.Tropez or Mykonos (not the food, the ambience) with cool music up loud and diners enjoying the sunshine on the pavement tables of Madison Ave in the nice shopping end.  Very European Summer !
Prices are not cheap but frankly compared to the more stuffy formal restaurants around here, well worth it if you want a fun lunch. Good people watching also (including body guards and all the jazz). The wine waiter tried to up-sell me a bottle that was ""double"" the price of my selection, and with the list really starting at $100 a bottle, this wasn't really appreciated however it alerted me to the way this was going to be, so don't be afraid to ask for the prices of the specials or 'suggestions' from the house - it will save you a nasty surprise and ruin what should be just a fun cruisy lunch.",Good,Good,Bad
"We called into this Italian restaurant to have dinner in New York.
My husband ordered the special of a veal chop and when the bill arrived it was priced at $99.00 for the chop alone.
To add insult to this they automatically added another 20% for the tip. The veal chop became even more expensive. Average Italian food with very average service at such an exorbitant price is an outrage.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"It was my personal mistake being attracted to it's nice atmosphere on the street in a sunny NY noon. I wish I read one of the reviews for the restaurant before ! Even though we saw the crazy prices, we were limited in time and ordered...Our food was good (mozzarella and linguine alle vongole), suggested wine by the glass was OK as well but seeing the price summed in the bill with never understood ""20% gratuity"" already entered for only bringing the food was a good lesson to us!",Bad,Bad,
"The one and only review I will ever put on the Internet. The absolute most abominable restaurant!! We were seated in a booth with extension cords coming out of the seat which I was told to ""ignore.""  When the waitress asked if we would care for a glass of champagne or a mimosa I accepted a glass of champagne. I should mention that she took it upon herself to charge me 56 dollars for one glass of th worst champagne product I have ever tasted which came to my table in a screw top. Yes!.. a screw top miniature bottle of champagne. I could have very well had two glasses of Veuve  !  It wasn't about the money we couldn't have cared less... but rather the diplorable service and environment considering the price point.  The staff was quite rude when we expressed displeasure at the product that was brought to the table. Zero was done to alleviate the situation... All those with any culture, palette and fine wine knowledge you will not enjoy your visit here.  Avoid at all costs.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We were walking down Madison Avenue when we saw this place and it looked very lively so we decided to sit down for lunch.  We were taken in promptly and then ordered 1 carpaccio salad and 2 mushroom fettucines.  Neither of us drank anything except for 1 bottle of Pellegrino.  We waited for 1 hour to get our fettucines and the bill was $180 USD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The food was good but please I ate at Gordon Ramsey at the London in February and paid $350 for 2 people with wine and it was a michelin star restaurant.  Outrageous prices, never again.",Bad,Bad,
"We stopped here for a light dinner before retiring to our room at the Pierre.  Boy were we in for a shock. Avoid this place....total rip off.  Surly service (if you can call it that), uncomfortable chairs, noisy - and the most ridiculous prices for totally average food at best.  $20 for a bottle of water, two salads, two small plates of pasta with tomato sauce (we could have had the same for $20 any place else)  - $200. I will stick with Bouley, Danielle, and a million other places for the same prices and get what I paid for.",Bad,Bad,
This place is obviously a front for mafiosi. Money laundering or whatever. The food is bland and tasteless. A glass of wine and a salad will run you $400.  It's an extortion racket. One of their tricks is to push daily specials that are 5-6 times more expensive than the already outrageous menu prices. I hope the Feds can get this place shut down and someone will go up the river for racketeering.,Bad,Bad,
"Other than the fabulous people watching (Botoxed blondes, muscle-shirted men, BLING galore), this ""elite"" emporium reeks pretense.  Outrageous prices, embarrassingly small portions, slap dash service.  Go for a drink, look around at the scene- unless you are a celeb, avoid this boite.  BFriend and I give it. Bronx Cheer when we pass by.  You should, too...",Bad,,
"Start with $15 for water, then $22 per glass for Prosecco. There is no lunch menu and the entrees are $30 to $40+ for pasta dishes with lobster ravioli topping the price chart at $64 per plate. Salads also run $30 to $40+. Service was good put there is no reason to eat at this restaurant. There are scores of great Italian restaurants in this city at prices 30 to 50% less.",Bad,,Good
The prices are ridiculous ... $75.00 for Dover sole??  Crazy. $26.00 for ordinary glass of white wine. DO NOT EAT HERE.,Bad,Bad,
"I can't believe they are still in business. The food is just average, hit or miss at the time. Not a single dish on the menu stands out. The waiters trained to empty valets on their customers. You will be offered a special pasta with truffles without mentioning the price of 250$. The glass of champagne that will cost a small fortune. Yet the location is next to Hermes and people don't mind to be ripped off just to sit there and look rich and famous. Bad news, the locals will look at you like you're stupid spending that kind of money on that kind of food. Enough said.",Bad,Bad,
"After nuemrous visits to Nello at Madison Avn over the years, the food and drinks remains the same, but the change of staff makes the restaurant and atmosphere less attractive and not at least the prices-, you feel to are cheated when paying USD 1.500 for lunch for 4 people-the double of Cipriani Up-Town, no wonder there are less visitors compared to the lively crowd we were used to. Nello needs ""to face the music"" and get back in shape !",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I made a reservation for 13 people, and when we arrived our table was neatly set up. It was the best spot they had. We were welcomed by a smiling staff and promptly seated. The waiters immediately brought large bottles of sparkling and still water, which they poured in every glass on the table, including the kids (later we found they charge $15 a bottle, and they were able to serve many). During all night, like vultures standing behind us, they kept filling our glasses after every sip. I was offered champagne 4 times and refuse it, and so did my guests, in an annoying push to sell liquor on that Easter evening. As we sat down, the maitre, standing next to me, recited all the specials, and I asked him to bring a couple of burratas for the table before we decided on the menu. But to our surprise, he brought us 9 burratas, split in 13 plates (at $50 each, as I learned later). So, stuffed with all that cheese, we proceeded to ordering the entrees. Most of us decided to share an entree. Four of us ordered the risotto Selvatici, and we all deemed it unkemarkable at best.  We had one foodie with us, and she was complaining something about how the tomato sauce in her gnocci just killed it for her. I must say though that the kids loved the ravioli they ordered.Two of us ordered a glass of wine each. We had 2 deserts that were split between the kids, and no one ordered coffee. They added 20% service to the check, which brought the cost to an eye popping $ 132.54 per person.",Good,Good,Good
"This restaurant is so over-priced it is breathtaking. The food is good but not spectacular, the decor needs updating and the sevice is stuck-up and unfriendly. We were there for Sunday lunch and the restaurant was almost empty with very little atmosphere.
An apetizer salad costs almost $30 and it is tiny. The specials are mega expensive (over $150 for an entree size and $80 for a half portion - again TINY.) Beware, the specials are not on the menu and the waiters mutter the prices under their breath so you really can't hear properly.
All in all, we left the restaurant feeling foolish at having spent so much on a very average meal in a city that has so many wonderful restaurants - Nello's is not one of them and we will not be going back.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"80 dollars for pasta appetizer please !! Wine overpriced , waiters smarmy, no atmosphere.  You should be able to take the fresh flowers home with you at those prices !! 900 dollar lunch for five people , one bottle of wine plus 20 percent grats for our convenience .  You are lucky to still have your doors open and I think the only reason you do is to capture random tourists who are looking to have a nice time in the heart of NYC.  Shame on you.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.... guess what this old dog won't do the same trick twice! We dropped in on the way back to our hotel from the Met. Granted the gentleman on front door was good, the service excellent and the flowers fresh but $9 for a cup of coffee or tea and $21 for a mediocre creme brule just doesn't make sense. I don't very often do bad reviews but I wish that I had seen the reviews on Trip Advisor before going in that door. We'll find a better spot for a coffee and a sweet next time.",Bad,,Good
We happened into Nello's while shopping on Madison Ave. We has a late very expensive lunch. We made the mistake of ordering off menu without asking prices. The food was ok for a middle priced place but for these prices it should have sung to us. We will not return.,Bad,Bad,
"During our trip someone suggested we go to Nello¬¥s... but we normally like to discover our own places. However, while walking on Madison Avenue, we were feeling peckish and we decided to try  a place we had just passed... The fact that it was Nello¬¥s was good, as we could tell our friends that we had indeed been to where they suggested.


Little did I know that it was so badly rated! I was fuming that I had dropped 350 dollars on this piece of **** lunch for only the two of us. Out of all the places to eat well, and I had to walk into this one! The waiter looked scruffy... the food was ok but nothing special and the ambiance was cold (in fact, the temperature was cold as well).


It¬¥s not only the money, but like I said... on vacation you have a limited amount of lunches and dinners and in NYC you want to try to enjoy the best. And this was nowhere near!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"$50 for a simple squid ink pasta. $20 for a glass of Averna. $40 for a plate of vegetables. I can go on and on. This is a restaurant for people that have either no sense of the value of money or love to show off their willingness to waste it. A perfect place for showoffs who like to bring overpriced call girls or dates that are out of their league. If you are the type of person that doesn't mind paying $35 for a glass of champagne at certain clubs in St. Tropez, then Nello is the place for you. If you are not, then either up your credit card balance before going or just simply avoid it and save yourself a monster jump in your blood pressure when the bill comes. An unconscionable waste of money.",Bad,Bad,
"I could tell you many stories about this place and the astronomical prices but I'll just stick to this- I stopped with a friend late afternoon to get an iced tea. We ordered two iced teas and one dessert. The service was okay- not great , not bad. There was no one else there, just us sitting outside. The bill came to over $50.
I would never go back here under any condition.",Bad,Bad,
"i used to come to nellos quite a lot but since i made the huge mistake to order the special of the day once and was charged a ridiculous amount for it ... and i mean ridiculous and totally out of order, i decided not to come back again. the place really is all about who wears what and arrives with which car and who gets the front tables. it started as a little cozy restaurant and turned into a zoo for the posh and wanna be posh crowd of new york. the food is good but its not worth the prices anymore, it feels like they charge the double but kept the same quality.
its not a bad restaurant, thats for sure but we ve had enough of all this circus around a quite an average place when it comes to taste, seating ( the ""so requested"" tables at the front are tiny and the chairs are more than uncomfortable ) and service.",Bad,,
I was there in January in a cold night and the place was empty. It is a mix of Italian and French food in my opinion very poor and quite expensive. Service is bad and never present even without many guest on other tables. It has an amazing expensive wine list where you pay 3 or 4 times the real value for a bottle of regular wine. If you have another option follow it and forget Nello's.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"We have not been to Nello in the past 3 years when we had a memorable meal with a fantastic lobster salad that we knew was $$. This time we order the two glasses of wine, one lobster salad, we ordered one of their special which was a truffle tagliatelle which was highly recommended by the waiter, unfortunately I did not ask for price, boy was I in for a surprise! Service was very poor, staff no were in sight when you wanted them ,then they slap you with a 20% tip. Bill $400 ++",Bad,Bad,Bad
"on a recent trip to New York , in my naivity I stumbled onto this ""Cafe"" for a simple coffee/cake break.....................wow -I should have realised how things were going to turn out but being out on a limb already thought "" What the heck, I am only going to be here once!"" Staff were uber polite, table linen amazing, floral arrangements to die for but I almost had a stroke when I was given the bill.Definitely way too overpriced & not that special. Sorry guys but maybe it is just a Scottish thing but I could never justify paying those prices for ordinary food. No amount of"" being seen"" is worth that................unless you are very pretentious & perhaps gullible...............AVOID!",Bad,Bad,
"I hadn't been to this place for awhile. I was uptown during the holidays and stopped in with my family for dinner. Terrible! Not only is the staff ridiculously snobby, which is always hilarious to me when you are the person serving the meal....why did you decide to get into customer service again?  I opened the menu and saw several 35.00 salads and 30-45 dollar soups, I suggested we have a glass of wine and a couple appetizers and go elsewhere. There were only 3 other tables seated in the restaurant and now I see why. With so many fabulous Italian restaurants with warm atmospheres in New York, get over yourselves!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Waiters tell you about specials that cost more than what originally ordering.  Unless specific about name of wine they will give you $35 glass of wine.   All in all one appetizer special, one coke and one red wine equals $100.

"Poor service and a very rude request to increase the tip from what I thought was an over generous 20 to 31!!!!
A complete cheek. If I could have got the original back I would have done. food ok but took absolutely ages. we were force fed very expensive bottled water throughout.
Thankfully no one went for the truffle risotto.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"It was a dark, cold rainy Sunday night but all the more reason to be welcoming to one of the few diners, myself and companion. But we were greeted with about as much enthusiasm as you might get from a street vendor who wants to go home.  You would think a plate of 49.00 rigatoni and an 18.00 glass of wine and a 24.00 salad should have the owners grinning from ear to ear! Lol. If  Pomp and circumstance is important to you and not a memorable culinary experience then this might be your place.
  The food was a bit above average but the whole experience just didn't match the cost so I left feeling underwhelmed.  
  Price is never a concern for me but it better match up with service,presentation
and quality of the food.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"A taxi driver recommended this restaurant.  We enjoyed the location and the food choices, although one out of four of us did not care much for the entree.

"Delightful atmosphere in a pleasant Madison Ave location. Very attentive staff, comfortable & great for people watching. Now the contrasts - while my pasta was excellent, it was terribly overpriced. My family had soups, they reported as average. Was never told about the charges for water, an obvious rip off as I now read. They went out of their way to accommodate my 6 yr old son's desire for chicken - yet it was also overpriced. Beautiful setting, some staff superb (Anastasia was great) but not worth the price.",Bad,Good,Good
this is one of the restaurants which is adopting the fiscal cliff well in advance. Their prices are well over the quality they serve. In my case the Maitre D offered their specials of the day and one of the dishes was risotto with white truffles . I've ordered it. When asked for the bill I was shocked to find out they charged. Usd 190.  The Maitre D did not even mentioned it when he indicated dishes. Which are not on the menus . When I  complained I received  discount of. 75 dlrs. .i find their attitude very arrogant. Further  they keep serving mineral water every minute seems thy are pushing sales of water . The last point they add to the bill 20 pct tip as  if its their right to charge it and not your option to express your appreciation .   If one ask me there any other establishment in New York which will  appreciate your visits,Bad,Bad,Bad
"As a former chef and now, food blogger I have eaten at some extraordinary places around the world.  Not doubt, quality food expertly prepared comes at a cost.  This is especially true in Manhattan. But it is always the chef's vision that brings me back to any restaurant I have tried.  I found that Nello has no clear vision that differentiates it from other restaurants of similiar cuisine.  My expectations were high, but I was sadly disappointed.  For example, my soup had a distinct metalic flavour.  The soup had a touch of diary and as diary products sometime pick up the flavour of metal if cooked in the wrong pot, I thought that may have been what cause to unsavory taste.  A friend who tasted the soup snidely suggested he could taste the can from whence the soup came. I have tasted rustic italian dishes that have risen to the level of haute cuisine.  My main course pasta dish was  mediocre, plain and uninspired.  And I gest you not - I have had better desserts from road-side dinners.  Nello is anything but the artful invention of food which I expected from a restaurant in this price point.  I would not eat here again and I believe serious foodies would be sincerely underwhelmed.",Bad,Bad,
"Beautiful location , a plate of crab ravioli each, 2 gin and tonics, one glass of wine , a salad shared, a coffee and a tea. $350 for two plus tip! The ravioli were specials and we were not given any prices on the specials. I would warn against getting caught.",,Good,
"I liked the food very much but the atmopshere and the tables into each other was a negative aspect:( It was a noisy atmosphere with a strange type of music. I honestly thought that the music is needless there ! I had fish for my main course and it was a special that day so it tasted pretty good. As for the appetizers, we have had crab salad and lobsters, they were OK, not great but OK...
And another negative thing was it was soo expensive even though it's not a luxurious and elegant place.",Good,Bad,
"First, if you are reading this and haven't yet gone to dinner, read all the reviews as there is a pattern and it's absolutely accurate. You have to think about this as a real estate transaction, not as fine dining. And it's going to cost you about $125/person, tip included, for four people for 2 hours if you are careful. From Nello's point of view, there is clearly a market for this and between his dining room (quite lovely, by the way) that's filled with people in their 30's and 40's and 50's mostly and the bar scene, it's very active........and it's got a great vibe (if this is the kind of vibe you like). As I said, I'm not going to rate this as I would a normal restaurant because it simply isn't. 


There is one thing that they do, however, that really ticks me off..........and there is another Italian restaurant on Madison Avenue that does the same thing. They up-sell........especially with their specials where the waiter tells you the item and not the price. 


Last night they were pushing white truffles. First came a plate of white truffles for all to smell. Then a list of all the items upon which white truffles have been added. When Dale was about to order the risotto with white truffles, I did something I rarely do.................it was so obvious to me that I just had to do it...............I asked her  to ask the waiter the price. When he said $275 but she could have a half order for $150, she passed. 


Clearly, much of the comment in the reviews that follow comes from this approach to business. And it seems to work for Nello. My guess is that there are many who don't ask the price and are simply surprised when the bill comes. 


So, as they say, caveat emptor. 


How do I feel about Nello's? Better than I did in 2009 when I wrote that I'd never return. I teased last night that when I feel that strongly about a restaurant and it survives 3 years, I should return and check again. Nello's is a great success and if we're all here at the end of 2015, we'll be back.",Bad,Bad,
"Everytime we were in NYC, we used to go to Nello's. The food is good and the atmosphere is a little bourgeois, but nice people and the place is located in the heart of the shopping area of the chic Madison Ave. But the last two times we were there, we felt that the staff was pushing us to spend money on alcoholic drinks. Ok, if you are there, is to spend money. But it is our choice what we want to have. We refused twice the drinks as we don't drink alcohol, and the hostess looked us in a way that we felt embarrassed. The food is Ok, not a great cuisine, just fine. After the meal, the waiter offered us the dessert, showing the samples. We refused and again, a disapproval look. When they brought the check, they charged more than what we had: two alcoholic drinks, one dessert and more...That was the second time it happened with us, which gave us a such bad impression! So sorry Nello's, if you continue this way, you'll lose your frequent customers! We are not coming back so soon! And for the price they charge, we have other greater cuisines to go in NYC!",Good,Bad,Bad
"My friend and I stumbled upon it when shooping, and decided to ask for a table BIG MISTAKE! There is no list, no keeping track of who came first, or how long you have been waiting for a table.  The manager told us it would be 10 minutes, but they were long past and he kept giving tables to people just coming in who were noticeably regular custumers.  After I got upset and asked him if I should leave, he gave us a table.  The food was really good but very scarce and expensive. Even the water, which you can't refuse because they come to you with two open bottles and ask gas or no gas? was $15 the bottle. Noqui $39. Tiramisu $21.  When we sat down we could tell that this is a place to where people come to see and be seen.  They also love the feeling they get when they get a table before other people who are waiting.  This is the reason they come here, to feel special.",Bad,Bad,Bad
this NYC institution has really gone down hill. I used to live in the area and was a regular diner. Now it appears to be popular with Asian tourists and so the detail and 5 star service has suffered. The food was OK but not outstanding. Prices are just as high as in the past of course. We had two courses and one glass of wine each and it was $350. Happy to pay that for exceptional but dont charge that for average! Avoid. Much better places in that neighbourhood too.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"During our recent visit to New York City (September 2012), we walked by Nello's on a beautiful afternoon after a stroll through Central Park. My wife and I commented when we saw diners eating al fresco at this restaurant and we decided to come back for dinner. We were really excited to try Nello's as part of our goals for the visit was to scout wonderful restaurants to bring our friends  and business colleagues to when we visit NYC in the future. Business and purchasing a condo (to enjoy today, and in our retirement) will bring us back often to this wonderful city!


We made reservations for 8:30pm Saturday night. Our table was ready when we arrived, and we were warmly greeted and were actually given a choice of tables. 


The first thing we found strange was that our waiter brought over two bottles of water, one sparkling and one flat, poured our choice, and then left both at our table, Despite not ordering either bottle of water - we were still charged $15 each for them. Our waiter then visited our table and reviewed the specials with us - no prices were ever offered, and now in retrospect, we were very stupid not to have asked. We will never do this again! 


My wife and daughter ordered pasta dishes off the menu. I ordered the Veal Chop, one of the specials highlighted by our waiter. I had seen the Veal Chop on the menu for $60.00, so I assumed the Special would be in the same range. For appetizers, my wife ordered the Arugala Salad, and my daughter and I shared the Fried Calamari. Although the Calamari Fritti was $25.00, we received probably 10 small calamari (and 3/4 of a plate of tomato sauce). My wife's Arugala Salad was dressed -  with salt only, and the Fontina Cheese tasted like it had just come out of a plastic wrapper - $22.00.  Although every other table had breadsticks/oil/balsamic on the table, we were not offered any, and we could not find our waiter to ask for some (recurring theme), so we ended up asking our busboy, and he eventually obliged. At this point, my wine was finished and I was looking for our waiter to order another glass. It took about 15 minutes before our waiter returned and finally asked if I would like another glass, which he did return with quickly, as I expect he realized we were starting to get angry with the lack of service we were receiving. 


We received our main course, and my wife immediately commented that her pasta (Rapini Pasta - $37.00) was very un-inspired and in fact tasteless. Her dish was supposed to contain oil and garlic, basic Italian ingredients, and her pasta contained neither. In the end, my daugter offered her some sauce from her Gnocchi Mona Lisa (39.00), and I offered her the mushrooms off my Veal cutlet to try and make her dish passable. We tasted our daughter's Gnocchi, and it was mushy and totally overcooked. All three of us agreed as to the very poor quality of the Gnocchi dish. It is not as if these were inexpensive dishes, and both my wife and daughter were completely under-whelmed with the quality of their meals. 


My Veal Chop, unlike our pasta dishes, was well prepared and good. 


We waited for our waiter to return and ask us for our feedback to our meal, and potentially to volunteer to fix my wife's meal. I do not believe we ever saw him for the rest of our dinner. Upon completion of our meal, a server's asssitant brought over a desert tray for us to review, but at that point we knew we wanted to leave and not waste any more time or money in this place. My wife asked to see our waiter so we could recieve our check, but he never re-appeared. She then asked three different wait staff over a period of 15 minutes to receive our check. Finally a waiter we had never seen or dealt with brought it to us. 


I now know why we never saw our waiter again - it must have been the pure shame of actually serving someone with a check as large as that for such crappy service and lousy meal. Our check came to $350.00 - and I was charged $125.00 for my Veal Chop ""Special"". We were all shocked that my meal was actually this much, but paid our bill and left the restauarant. The only good news of the evening is that our waiter paid for half of my Veal Chop dinner as we left without leaving any tip. 


On my way out, I did ask to speak to the owner and met with the manager on duty. I explained our frustration with our dinner and service, and all he could offer was his ""dismay"", as if this had never happened before, and I was the first person that had ever complained about the service/meal/cost of our evening? I was clearly an anomoly and he offered no remedy and did not seem to care as we were clearly visitors to NY and would likely not be back. A truer statement has never been made. 


My daughter and I got back to our hotel and looked at reviews of Nello's because we just could not believe what had happened. What we found very quickly was this is clearly a pattern for this restaurant. We were not alone - our story is a common one, with many more reviews much more disappointing than our own.  My only regret is that we did not look at any reviews before making our reservations. I am very hopeful you will read this and NOT GO! 


I am truly shocked that this restaurant has survived for so long and with so many terrible reviews. It was THE worst dinner experience - ever!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I had heard much about this restaurant so finally got the chance to go. It is a very nice spot on Madison with outdoor seating. The food was very good as well. Straight forward and exactly what it should have been. High quality and well prepared,but.....
The glass of champagne we ordered when we arrived (for which we never saw the label) cost $37.00 each. The special of the evening we ordered, Dover Sole was $75.00 per and the endive salad consisting of endives and gorgonzola cheese was $27.00 and the Greco di Tufo was $80.


I have no problem spending good money for a great dinner but even for me this is as unreasonable as i have ever seen. Sounds like they expected the USGS to show up. Go at your own financial risk.",Bad,Good,
"Yesterday was Labor Day and after a nice walk in Central Park, my husband and I decided to have luncheon on Madison Avenue.  We had been to Nello's years ago and, at that time, had been very pleased with the food, service and value.  Not yesterday!  First, the waiter showed up at our table with two bottles of opened water bottles, one sparkling and the other flat.  I never accept bottled water that has been opened outside of my viewing.  We asked for tap water and were presented with two glasses of tepid water.  We then asked for ice and one glass of ice was delivered.  By the way, the bottled water we later learned costs $15.  We missed the bullet on that one.


The waiter asked for our wine order but by this time my suspicions were raised and we asked for the luncheon menu and wine list.  My husband misread the wine list and thought that the first column was the price per glass.  It wasn't.  It was the vintage ( only the last two digits of the year were printed thus he only read the number ""10"",not 2010).  The actual price for the cheapest white wine on the menu was $18.  Yes, $18.  We decided to pass on the wine order.


The waiter offered up the specials but did not offer the prices.  When I inquired about one special and asked the price (it was a salad), he stated it was $50.  No sale there.  After inspecting the printed food menu and seeing the outrageous prices, we both just ordered appetizers at $27 each.   Both were underwhelming.  


I felt that this place is a scam and that the customers are innocent pasties.  We will never go back.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Great food, kind of expensive but we always go there at least once during our stay. You can have lunch late in the afternoon and it's much quieter.",Good,,
"I seldom write in trip advisor. But Nello's was so bad they simply did everything to deserve it. The food is mediocre at best, the only thing first are the prices and the location is ok. If they tell you the specials then ask for the prices, we didn't and ended paying 850$ for 3 adults and 2 kids with only three lousy glasses of cheap wine. Stay away!!!",Bad,Bad,
"Okay, this restaurant is in a wonderful part of New York and it is in a great location...BUT, the prices are off the charts...I took my wife and two daughters there for a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine...we had 4 x main courses, 1 x bottle of water, 1 x bottle of house wine, 1 x shared dessert and 3 x coffees...the food was acceptable...the price of $555- was not...the prices are ludicrous!!! If you are a visitor to New York City, BEWARE of this total rip-off!!!",Bad,Bad,
"This is a very good restaurant,,, but I must agree with most,you might think you are getting a deal when you order the special drinks and or lunch??? Right??? But when most things on the menu are under 40.00 dollars,it might surprise you that our special drink sangria was 32.00 dollars a glass and my lobster ravioli was 60.00 dollars,,yes 60.00 dollars... So as my husband said when I called and said my lunch for me alone was 100.00 before tip,he said did you not look at menu or ask price,  said No ,,,, so he said then shame on you,,, lol should have asked,,, but  I will say it was an awesome meal,great atmosphere, would go again,but would ask price before ordering....
So all in all will visit again ,it was a restaurant on the Upper Eastside.....

The food is OK but the prices are outrageous.  I never knew pasta could be so expensive.  Be weary when they bring two open bottles of mineral water to your table;  it will cost you 30 dollars.  Say no thank you and ask for tap water although I am not sure that they will not charge you for the tap water.,Bad,,

So overpriced that you just bend over and take it, knowing that you will never, ever be back.
Horrendous operation!",Bad,Bad,
"This place is a complete and utter ripoff.  Our waiter told us the specials and when we asked for the prices he balked at telling us. The bottom line was the pasta dish ""special"" cost $175.00.  We ordered off the menu and still spent over $450 bucks for a light dinner for 4. Oh yeah, the waiter charged us for 4 bottles of water when we only had 2 and a mystery entree had appeared on our check too. Thankfully we noticed the ""oversight"" and had the bill changed.  This place gives the restaurant business a bad name.  Just stay away!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We went to Nello's with friends from Manhattan. I'm not sure if they had been before or not. We had looked it up before we went and knew that it was pricey but had not realized just how pricey it would be. 
The food was nice and the service good but not so much so to justify the price. We made the mistake of agreeing that an appetizer plate for the 6  of us sounded perfect and then all ordered from the specials described by the waiter. I didn't look, not do I think anyone else looked at the actual menu so no one had seen prices. The waiter had described the food but neglected the price and none of us thought to ask (you know it going to be pricey and just decide to enjoy the evening). However the final bill was just outrageous (I'm embarrassed to even say what it was, that is just admitting how stupid we were). 


Just don't go. Get the subway to Greenwich village or Soho and find a nice restaurant there. There may even be nice ones that you don't have to sell the farm to pay for a meal in midtown, just not this one.",Bad,Bad,
"We were hungary after a full morning of walking and shopping and came across this nice looking place that was busy and so we stopped for lunch. What a mistake! It was overly loud, tables were cramped together, and menu prices were outrageous. We should have kept on walking. There are too many really good places in Manhattan to settle for Nello's.",Bad,Bad,
"Jammed in seating and when we asked for a glass of champagne it was $40/glass!! When we declined the waiter became rude and then didn't seem to care about the service. The food was good not great for the prices they were charging. Even the dessert staff was pushing them after we said no. Oh, and the champagne was not a French vintage!!! Just not worth paying a hefty bill and being treated like leftovers!!!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I wouldn't hesitate to pay for a good meal but this place gave me the feeling that I had been cheated. Food,decoration,service...everything was just ordinary but the prices were extremely high.

"I recently had a lunch in Nello's with my family. The place was crowded as usually and waiters all the time hit my chair. For 2 adults and 3 kids we ordered 1 spaghetti, 2 pastas with vongole, 1 carpacco, Caesar salad, 2 bottles of water, 1 beer and 2 glasses of White wine. 1 coffee and 3 desserts. Pastas were good, like in a traditional Italian trattoria, so just good. Add the rest was just good. So why the prices are SO HIGH?!!!!!! Just stupid!!! The check was $520, 20% were automatically added!!! For what? This is not NY, this is a Moscow style, it looks like a place with OK food and super expensive ordinary drinks. So if you want to be cheated and pay for a simple lunch in a company of retired 3rd devision ""celebrities"" over $500 - go to Nello's and be upset after.",Bad,,

This pissed us off more....why did he give us discount and not to all of the customers? Just because we complain? So we have to complain to pay what is worth? Even with the discount it wasn't worth paying, the pasta was bad.
I dont care about paying if the food is really good, but I care about paying what is worth,
My mother and I were pissed off all day.

I went there with some friends .They offered us many plates that weren't at the menu. We thought that the price would be  similar to the others plates on the menu. Completely wrong! They charged us 125$ for an over cooked lagostine salad. the service.... Terrible as the food.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"Staying at a hotel on Madison Avenue so decided to call in at Nello's for a glass of wine in the evening as it looked to be a nice friendly, bistro style restaurant. We asked what wines were available by the glass. A list was 'rattled off' by the waitress but we weren't given a wine list. Ordered two glasses of shiraz. We were then given a bill for $56 for 2 glasses of 'organic' shiraz. When we questioned the price staff were unable to show us the wine on the menu & all, including the manager, were rude, arrogant & totally unprofessional. Eventually we were given a new bill for $36 dollars - $18 being the cheapest glass of wine on the menu. Everywhere else in New York we met with courtesy, Good & friendliness. AVOID THIS PLACE!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I can go on and on about this restaurant.  Similar to other reviewers the only words I can quickly say about this place is SHADY and INTIMIDATING. 


I don't care how financially comfortable you are, this place is shady and constantly are ""out"" of the cheaper($100<) items .  They will NOT tell you that the specials cost over $250 when the average entree is $40-50.  


Waiters are eying you down constantly and certain men just stand by the doors guarding the whole time.  There are SOOO many other great restaurants to NYC that are worth $$$$.  If you are on a cheaper budget go to Carmines you'll get better tasting italian food than this garbage.

"Seemed ok when we first came in the door. Service was ok. Food, well that is another story. I had lobster bisque which was cold and had shell fragments in them during each spoonful. Cost was $49. I decided on Lobster ravioli. 5 raviolis for $125.00. You do the math. A dinner for 4 with a drink each was over $600.00. NEVER AGAIN. We ended up going into Little Italy to Lombardis for pizza. A vendor on the street corner had better tasting food.

"I took my grandson to Beretta's on Boxing Day to select the 'little something' he said he wanted for Christmas.  We stopped in to Nello which looked like the typical Madison Avenue upscale eatery (like La Golue of blessed memory, or like the places on the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore which those blocks of Madison Avenue resemble fairly closely.  We each had one glass of perfectly adequate house red ($24 each); I had some veal with mash potatoes and Ian had a dish of pasta (thank God not the $250, yes, two hundred and fifty dollar!!) pasta with truffles featured in the NY Times ""Haggler"" for Jan 8, 2012).  The bill with tax and tip - - thank God also we resisted the beautiful waitress' importunings for dessert and coffee-- with tax and tip was $170+.  I will of course never, ever fall into this trap again.  Moral of the story: if there's no menu posted outside, pass on.  And never, ever order an off-menu special without asking the price.  Nello justifies their price, according to the Haggler, by its proximity to Hermes.  Why not, I ask, justify armed robbery by proximity to Beretta's gun shop next door.  Do NOT go there.",Bad,Bad,
"TERRIBLE SERVICE! I took a colleague to Nellos to see if she wanted to have a private party there in February --and the entire staff was rude! The Asian gentleman with the slicked back hair and Black glasses was particularly rude! When I complained, to the Arabic hostess, she seemed annoyed that I would have issue with being mistreated. After a feeble attempt to make things right, the entire staff stood around and leered at us while we were eating, and talked about us right in front of our face. The food was ok -- however, not good enough to endure such poor service! I agree with Bill E! I was livid -- hours later, I could not stop talking about our experience. Not worth the money or the aggravation!",Bad,Bad,Bad

It was a cozy, very pretty atmosphere adorned with fresh flowers on each table and massive fresh greenery arrangements on the bar.

"It looked nice and friendly from the outside an authentic Italian restaurant in manhattan. Authentic 1900 all right this place has applied mafia principals in ripping off their patrons they suck you in, take your coat seat you hussle some drinks out of you and sucker punch you with their specials before you can say how much, then comes the main course and you will feel small if you do not eat an appetizer  too The water and drinks just appear and you think a bit crowded but hey it's Manhattan then the bill arrives and I boy even for one of the most expensive cities in the world this is a new high! Why this place is allowed to keep on ripping visitors to manhattan defies

The awful service?  The bait-and-switch menu? The sleazy shady waiters?  The mob-like host?  Or do I talk about the food, which looked and tasted like it came out of a ramen-noodles package?  I don't even know!  But the finale is the bill, loaded with things you didn't ask for like $15 water or things you've never even heard of ""white truffle"" oozing out costing hundreds of dollars nowhere to be found on the menu, which lists $29 pasta.

"I dined here recently with a friend, one of Nello's celebrity regulars, who they greet by name. It was very busy (why I don't know), but we were shown to our table fairly quickly. Equally quickly handed our menus, while the waitstaff hovered for the order. Once we made our order, the food was served quickly... Faster than fast, and not hot...only warm. We had no more than barely finished dessert when the check was placed on the table. Are we feeling rushed, yet? They took the check quickly and brought it back even quicker! The waitstaff waited while we totaled out the check. They asked if we had coats, and we gave them the ticket. BUT how silly of us...we were not allowed to wait at our table for our coats. A waiter stood behind my chair saying ""thank you...thank you....thank you""...until we stood up from the table. We were made to stand in a cold door way until they brought our coats to us. I found the experience uncalled for and humiliating. Had I been paying the bill, I would most certainly NOT have left a tip! Not for this kind of rushed service. I felt OUR business was not appreciated, and they were practically pushing us out the door to make room for others. Very unacceptable behavior by waitstaff. I am sure management coaches them along these lines, so a complaint to management would have fallen on deaf ears. I hope myl celebrity friend was as offended as I was and will not return very soon. For myself, I plan to not ever return! I'm a physician and used to being treated well in the finest restaurants. I don't need to feel like a bum taking up too much real estate in a restaurant. Parts of a fine dining experience are fine food, fine ambience and fine, LEISURELY service. This place misses on all three accounts! Two words: DON'T GO HERE. Try the Restaurant at the Carlyle... You are allowed to relax leisurely and treated like a queen...the way it should be!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This place is famous for the most expensive plate of spaghetti in town. Same for the calamari (they are good, but the portions have shrunk greatly over the years, whereas the price has tripled). It's fun if you want to people watch and see the more ""decadent side of life"". In the Summer the outdoor tables are good fun, but beware, it might make you feel empty (not just your wallet).",Bad,Good,
"We stumbled upon Nellos when we were walking down Madison Ave, and at first impressions we thought we had found a lovely little place among the busy city.  This soon changed.  When we entered, the suited doormen quickly welcomed us in and sat us down.  It was all a little awkward and we felt under a bit of pressure to dine.  


We were given a bottle of water straight away (which later we found cost us $15!) - this came with the lid off and we were both fairly sure it was tapwater as it didn't taste like bottled.  We looked at the wine list, and were shocked at the prices, e.g. Jacobs Creek red $125 a bottle! (We drink this wine a lot and even in NYC $30 - $40 a bottle should be max price).  After being asked repeatedly if we wanted a bottle of wine, we ended up asking for just two glasses of house red (costing $36 we found out!).  The mains were expensive, so we didn't bother with starters; which appeared to offend them.  We had two meals which were, to be fair, good quality nicely made meals - but not worth the price and very small portions.  We finished and asked for the check/bill straight away to avoid any unwanted extras being given to us.  


Throughout the whole meal and when the bill came, there were six suited men at the front of the restaurant constantly glaring at us - we both felt vey uncomfortable.  They had added themselves on a 20% gratuiuty and the number of people between us and the door made us reluctant to challenge this.  In the end, two glasses of house red wine (small, approx 125mls), two plates of food (one veal, one chicken) and one compulsory bottle of questionable water cost us $186.  We left feeling cheated - we travel and eat out quite a  bit and this is the worst dining experience ever, anywhere in the world. Do yourselves a favour and avoid this place at all costs, you WILL be cheated otherwise!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"You should stay away from this place at all cost. 


We went there with out two kids (12 years old) The waiter presented the specials that included Tagliatelle with Truffle.  Our kids wanted to taste Truffle, so we ordered that. The price of $275 was not mentioned by a single word.


We was highly surprised when we got the bill totaling $859 - we thought is was a mistake, which is was not. They charged 275 for a plate with pasta and a little truffle - this is not a rip off but in my opinion a fraud and scam.  They even reminded me that in NY it was customary to pay 15-20% in additional tips. I.e. the total price for each plate was $275+8,8% tax + 15% tip = $344!!!


After an argument $250 was deducted from the bill. I regret that I was so put of by the episode that I did not think of calling the police to come.  Please see attached scan of the bill for details",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I had lunch at nello's yesterday.  Foolishly we chose the special; pasta with truffle shavings without asking the price. The food was ok but the bill for two plates of pasta , two white wines and a bottle of Pellegrino was $880 ! On one level it was totally my fault as I should have been more aware of what was going on reflection this is just place is just a scam.

I was walking with my wife on the thanksgiving day and we felt tired somwe sawnthis cafe around 5 pm so we decided to have a rest and a dinner as well... We entered and they served us some big bottle of water ... The atmospher is good but not wow... I saw they menu and notice the prices are little bit expensive around $40 per main course .. But we decided to go ahead because most of the restaurants are closed today... The thing that I did not like that the servant did not ask me if I want to drink anything .. But I asked if they have orange juice .. He said yes .. Then they brought out main without the orange juice .. I asked again he said they are running out of orange and sent someone to buy ... I was thirsty and I could change it to any other drinks if they had told me that earlier .. Anyhow I finished my meal and I kept drinking water ... Then they brought the orange juice .. I did not want to make a big deal of it so I got it it.. Was just a small glass of oj ... My wife is pregrent and she felt she wanted some dessert so we ordered two dessert only ... Then I asked for my bill ... I was shocked $200 for our meal .. This is the most expensive food I have ever had ... It was not bad but it does not worth that money ... They have cya Rhee me $12 for a small orange juice $ 15 for the bottle of water that I did not ask for ... They have but 20% tip by them self ...

"My husband and I and another couple stopped in here as we strolled down Madison Ave.  Not realizing what we had come across, we were ushered into the packed restaurant by a very friendly doorman.  Once inside our coats were taken (whether we wanted that or not) and offered a menu. The prices were astronomical.....as already stated in other reviews...$30 and up for pasta.  The waitstaff while attentive were scurrying around like chickens with their heads cut off constantly bumping into each other and seated customers ...certainly not the place for a relaxing lunch! The pasta was okay but certainly not worth the price tag.....the champagne was lovely ...but it too was pricey as was the bottled water.  In the end our bill was over $400 for 4 plates of pasta, 4 glasses of champagne, 2 bottles of water, and 4 desserts.  The clientele were equally as pretentious as the menu.  If you are looking for a relaxed cozy italian restaurant.....then this isnt the place for you.",Bad,,

"No one told us how much our lunch specials were. Nothing on the menu was priced over $65. 
We did not expect to pay $270 for (1) plate of pasta with a small amount of shaved truffles. When we recieved our bill about the price charged they told us we should should have asked about the price of the specials.

It was like something out of an Al Pacino movie.  A LITTLE SCARY.  I politely asked for a business card and he went in and came back to say that they didnt have any.  What are they doing in that restaurant?   It was clear that we were not welcome to even be in front of their place-- and on a public street!  Maybe these guys were security for a VIP Asian guest?  TheJapaneese ambassador resides close by.   Maybe you can only stop in front of the restaurant if you drive a Ferari of Mazerati or Bently, etc as we observed of their guests during the week.  I drive a Ford. It was a turn off.  NY does better without places that are so stuffy.  Save that for LA.  I was interested in taking my wife to a fancy dinner and Considered them as an option.

When the check arrived, I had been charged $125! When I objected, the manager blamed me for not asking the price. After some debate, he offered to drop the price of my chop by 25%, which I rejected. Finally, to avoid a scene, I agreed to pay 50% and added no tip to my payment. Never in my life have I encountered such a 'scam' and I hope others are warned by my experience and avoid this unprincipled place.

The food was frighteningly expensive and being too embarrassed (and too British) to leave, we tried to choose something a little more in our price bracket. Ha ha ha. They must have had a run on white truffles and lobster as they were trying to give us the hard sell with all the expensive dishes. We only wanted brunch!!
We counted FOURTEEN members of staff waiting on in the most intimidating manner, literally watching us eat, in a restaurant half full, not to mention the three men in black at the door, who never moved the whole time we were there (maybe to stop customers leaving??) $125 later (for three bowls of pasta and some water), not to mention the 20% tip (which we paid cash) - this place left the most horrible taste in our mouths.

6.  20% automatically added for service even though we were never once ask if we needed anything.  I'm sure the tip is added because no one would give a 20% tip for such terrible service.  (Lunch for 2 over $400!!!)
I would not recommend this restaurant.  In addition to the various scams the food is mediocre.  Perhaps they should be reported to the Better Business Bureau!",Bad,Bad,Bad
This is the kind of place that gives NYC a bad rap.  $100. for the special of the day which was a little pasta with olive oil and a couple shavings of black truffles.  What a rip off and they have the gall to add on a 20% gratuity.  I suggest everyone stay away.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"The food is barely acceptable.  The service is surly.  The prices are preposterous, for the food, the wine, the coffee ---everything.
I would not recommend this restaurant on any measure.  We travel all over the world, and this is the worst.",Bad,Bad,Bad
I live part time in New York and had three friends visiting when we happened into Nellos for an early dinner on a drizzly night last week  It was very expensive but beautiful so we settled in for a nice meal. What happened to us was appalling.  We asked about the specials which were described to us (by Nello himself) in some detail but without prices. We knew from the menu that the restaurant was very expensive but when the bill came our two pasta specials were $390 dollars. Beyond outrageous.  The most expensive pasta on the menu was $67. We found the food delicious and we were treated very well despite being non-celebrities but that was shameful. It was an example of everything people hate about New York CIty.  What an embarrassing rip off.,Bad,Bad,
Very Overpriced and arrogant service. There are too many good restaurants in NYC to waste your time or money here. It is good if you want to be seen or say you have been there.,Bad,,Bad
"First of all, don't believe the hype ot Nello. The food is ok / good. Nothing to write home to mom about... NOTHING. And it's so overpriced it's ridiculous! Pasta for $100? Come on... 


The servers are pretentious. I was there with 2 girlfriends of mine - after our meal that we didn't love anyway, the server dropped off a check with 20% gratuity included. 


I walked over to where the servers were hanging out at the bar and asked if it was common that they grat a check for a party of 3. I was given that it was ""standard and common when we don't know the guests"".


I stated - ""are you aware that it is against the law to add this to a check?""


He stuttered, we went back and fourth a few times and he eventually took the gratuity off the check. He brought out drinks as a form of apology. 


It took all 3 of us, 3 days and numerous phone calls to even speak with a manager as no one would give out his name. No one would put him on the phone and there is no e-mail address for contact on the website. 


I later heard that Nello was shut down for 3 days of service due to a monetary issues. Do yourselves a BIG favor and just don't even go... It's not worth the hassle.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Service was slow, prices were crazy  $28 for a vodka, give me a break",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Having just saved ourselves hundreds of dollars in the fantastic Choo sale.... starving and parched we unwittingly stumbled next door to Nello.  I for one was not particularly hungry as the jet lag was hitting home with a vengeance....


It was the first day of our 5 day trip to nyc and we really got things off to a credit card tastic start blowing at least 3 days dinner money on two plates of antipasti and a bottle of Sancerre at Nello.


The least expensive bottle on the menu was 150 dollars. Our waitress looked rather upset when we only ordered the antipasti (and thank god for that).  Anyway.... being in the holiday spirit we decided to go all out and ordered 5 Bellinis risking calls from our various credit card providers...


Was it worth it?  not really, it was hugely over priced and although the food was good, our next 5 days of eating put both the food and the prices at Nello to shame.  Nello... must try harder  and get a reality check on your bloody prices!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Like many of the other reviews, we wandered into Nello looking for a nice dinner and we were more than happy to pay N.Y. prices.  Upon scanning the wine list, my husband's face dropped...the average bottle was $350 +.  This led me to quickly look at the menu prices and in all our life, all over the world, we have never seen such ridiculous prices.  My husband ordered the Portobello mushroom appetizer at $34 which tasted no better than when we put it on the BBQ at home.  Our pasta dishes were fine but certainly not anything worth the prices charged.  This place is an absolute rip-off even by NYC standards.  I'm ashamed that we did not stand up and leave!  Hopefully these reviews are read prior to wondering unsuspectingly as we did.  We will never return to Nello.",Bad,Bad,
"I must tell that we didn't choose Nello's, it was sunday at 2:00 pm and it was the only restaurant with a free table for 4 in the area.
When we get the menu we asked ourselves if we stay or leave.
The prices are delirious even for NY. So we decided to stay to see if the food worth the price.
We were lucky our waiter did it's best, the service was really OK, the food correct but nothing to do with the price. For this amount your can go 2 times at Pearl Oyster Bar !!!


What is amazing is that it was full, I think newyorkers are masochists !!!",Bad,Bad,Good
"The food was very good, but I was very surprised at the prices - even in NYC.  $25 a glass for OK champagne was a bit much.  Service was not in keeping with the price range, but my principal complaint was how packed in the tables were.  We had to get up from our meal to let other diners in and out of their table!  Not acceptable.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"My wife and I decided to have lunch at Nello's in full knowledge that it would be an overly expensive venture.  But what the heck; we are young, in love and spending our honey moon in New York!  Extravagance is justified under these circumstances.  Extravagance not total rip-off!!! First bad impression came when we ordered a bottle of still water and were served a bottle of ""Voss"" that was obviously tampered with (no cap, visibly overused bottle) and filled with regular, good, old New York tap water.  I could taste it right away.  Fool that i am i said nothing.  Then the ""joker"" someone else mentioned here, came to our table with a jar full of truffles begging us to smell them! OK! They smelled like truffles! Lets have some. I ordered a beef carpacio with the truffles (little did I know!).  We also ordered two of their super expensive pastas. No drinks!  just an espresso at the end.  Total?  $250!!!!  I was handed the check and my jaw dropped!  They charged $15 for the tap water, and $100 for the carpacio (which was not listed in the menu for obvious reasons)!  I left Nello's with a bad taste in my mouth and it was not because of their food!  KEEP AWAY!",Bad,Bad,
"We were taken by surprise by the extravagantly expensive menu.  It's almost unimaginable to think that a bowl of 'simple' pasta can cost $48 and a bottle of Voss water $15.  The highlight and most memorable is to be served a $21 dessert (that's for each) small and I mean small portion and see what you get for $21  


We all know that pasta is inexpensive and to be asked to pay $48 and $44 for a serving is preposterous.


Perhaps Peter Beard has decided that if the Madison Avenue address is pretentious then the prices on the menu should also be overpriced. 


Yes, the food is good or I should say ""fair"" as the prices overwhelm your senses and detract from the enjoyment of what a simple dish should be!


How posh and how poorly posh this restaurant is for the passer by.


New York is filled with extraordinary places of which in the words of Ruth Riechl - ""New York is the best fed city on the planet.  No one should be disappointed in both the fare and the cost of dining in this city"".


What a severe disappointment.  Be prepared or I should say, be forwarned.   Guard your wallet or lose it!",Bad,Bad,
"Our dining experience was thouroughly unpleasant.  We found the staff frankly unpleasant.  They were snooty and poor at their job.  We were a party of just two and ordered two pasta dishes.  The waiter managed to mess up one of the orders which he took back to the kitchen with ill grace.


The atmosphere  in the restaurant was negative and both of the pasta dishes were, at best, mediocre. We would have quickly forgotten the price that we  paid had the dinner been worth it but it was not.  We have eaten better pasta dishes in modest pizzerias.  Avoid Nello.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I love this place. I always eat lunch here when I'm in New York. In my opinion this is one of the best Italian restaurants in the world, and that I'm willing to pay for.",Good,Good,
"The staff at the door is welcoming, the decor bright and inviting, the floral arrangements spectacular... but once they've drawn you in, watch out!  Before they've pushed in your chair or given you a menu, you've ordered an $18 bottle of water and a $24.00 glass of wine.  But you have to hand it to this restaurant, they've mastered the con.  We actually got a good laugh out of it, as did two other couples we bumped in to on the way out the door.  Oh, and the appetizer -- we had ""caught on"" at that point - was mediocre, at best.  There's one born every minute... and that's what Nello is counting on.  But this sucker won't be back!",Bad,Good,Good
"Flashback - Fashion week 2007.....on a gorgeous Friday noontime, my best friend and I accidentally fall in line on a path into Nello's.....Branco greets us like we are princesses in exile from his home country...Croatia. We were seated at the breezy outside cafe section just inside the window. A view of the people and the bustling lunchtime crowds. We proceed to be showered with Bellini's (champagne cocktails for those of you who don't know). Fabulous Insalata Mista salad and Savignon Blanc. Lunch for 2 was approximately $110 with several drinks of course......We loved it so much, we came back the following week for dinner. We again, were greeted like Royalty and dined on menu selection ""Tagliata"" Grilled Prime Aged Steak with two bottles of mid ranged priced Cabernet. Bill was $900. The best $900 we spent in NYC for dinner.....Except maybe for Towne located in Chambers hotel (very cool/exclusive) But Nello's is now a staple visit in the big apple!",Good,Good,Good
"After my girlfriend picked up her watch from repair at Chopard boutique across the street, we were ushered in to Nello by a Tony Soprano wannabe ‚Äúhost‚Äù, with the fraise ‚ÄúGo talk to Jenny (or whatever the name was) ‚Äì she‚Äôll sit you‚Äù, and with that, the pleasant Saturday afternoon stroll through Madison turned into an experience that left quite the sour taste in mouth. I truly hope to prevent others from enduring the same. We ordered a round of drinks without looking at the menu, - turned out to be $25.00 each, for the less than adequate majitos. When I opened the menu, however, I thought mine was spiked!!! A true believer in paying what the market will bare, this time I was truly offended by the prices: $40.00 for a mozzarella appetizer, $50.00 for prosciutto and what truly took the cake the lobster salad ‚Äúspecial‚Äù that my girlfriend ordered - turned out to be $90.00 and was borderline disgusting. Our bill came to around $400.00 and although I‚Äôm fortunate enough to ignore it financially, some sense of social consciousness condemns me to yell out loud: ‚ÄúAvoid! Avoid! Avoid!‚Äù",Bad,,
"The worst thing for a turist is to feel like an idiot. We were walking on Madison Ave. and decided to stop at this restaurant for a quick lunch. The Maitre suggested us some options out of the menu. One of them was the Risotto with Black truffles. We ordered it, thinking that this option would follow reasonably the other menu options.
The food was OK. But then we received the bill... and they charged exactly USD 200 for the Risotto! Unbelievable! Forget about this restaurant. For this price you will be much better served at restaurants such as Per Se or Daniel, and will not feel as an idiot.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Tourists beware!!! Nello's is a trap of epic proportions!!!!


I eat in NYC restaurants all the time and know that the prices can be high. Nello's is not high; it is a rip-off trap. You're lured in because the place has the atmosphere of a non-pretentious cafe. There is NOTHING about Nello's that screams $$$$$. We never even questioned the waiter about the cost of the specials because the atmosphere was so ""ordinary"". Anyway, how much can a small lobster salad and a dish of 3 raviolis be at lunch time?


How about $50.00 for the tiny dish of pasta and $90.00 EACH for the lobster salad (smaller than your fist). Not to mention $10.00 a piece for a 5 oz. coke, $22.00 for a bottle of water and $12.00 for a cup of coffee...FOR LUNCH!! 


To make matters worse, the food was mediocre at best. I mean, who puts cilantro (loads) in a LOBSTER salad? How are you supposed to taste the 3 measly pieces of lobster that in the dish with all that cilantro? At $30.00 per piece, I want to taste the lobster.


AVOID NELLO'S LIKE A PLAGUE THAT WILL EAT THROUGH YOU WALLET IN LESS TIME THAN YOU CAN SAY ""Holy $%^$, is that MY bill""!",Bad,Bad,
"We decided on dinner near the hotel before going back to the airport.  It looked clean and nice on the outside.  We knew it would be expensive but we didn't feel like traipsing all over to find another  restaurant.  We spent $350 for two people and that was without drinks.  ( Pellegrino water was $18/bottle and we had two).   The food was good but I have had better and at a more reasonable price.  I had a caesar salad and it was disappointing.  There was no hint of anchovy and the hearts of romaine were bitter and the slice of parm cheese on top was not as high quality as you would expect.  I go to Rome at least once every 6 weeks and eat at pretty high end restaurants.  Even with the euro exchange rate, I get better tasting food at cheaper prices in Rome.
The waiting staff were very professional and accommodating.  And the coat check girl did pounce on your coat upon entering!  Maybe it was a ploy to hold the patrons captive?",Bad,Good,Good

"If you like to dine in a snobbish atmosphere, and pay dearly for it, then Nellos is your place.  Not only was the server rude, he seemed completely disinterested in having to serve our table.  Not to mention the prices!  $150 for the cheapest bottle of wine that would sell at the wine shop for under $20.  Average food and definately not worth the price.  Nice atmosphere though.  Not a place to go to unless you are on an expense account or actually enjoy being treated poorly!!",Bad,Good,Bad
"For Madison Avenue and a small clan of photographers standing outside waiting for a shot of Andrew Lloyd Weber to emerge, I expected our lunch to be more than average.   I was with two good friends, one of them an absolute foodie and the other who had lunch there a few months ago.  I had the lobster raviolis that tasted like they were sitting on the shelf too long waiting for the other courses.  And, although my sole in champagne sauce was very good, the presentation was unimpressive and the sauce was uninteresting.   My friend was also unimpressed with the veal milanese commenting that the bread crumbs were ""soggy"".   The dessert was another disappointment since I didn't expect to bite into a brownie when it was presented as chocolate cake.   Having recently eaten at Del Posto and David Burke & Donatella, Nello did have tough acts to follow but I definitely expected an above average meal.",Bad,Bad,
"We were 6 lady friends stopping in for lunch Dec 1, and met up with horrible service.  We ordered 5 soups and were delivered 4 of them.  The head waiter and his assistant had a fight over our table as to how many soups were ordered.  The fifth soup finally came 30 minutes later.  My chicken noodle soup was too salty, for the $27 it cost.


When we went to leave they could not find my friend's mink vest.  After 40 minutes of searching, it was found at the bottom of the dirty laundry basket.  While the manager tried to explain, the head waiter argued about his missing extra tip,  No compensation was offered. 


Don't go there!!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The food and service were good but certainly not worth nearly the price charged! Worst of all, they did not inform me of the cost of things. I paid $15 for a bottle of still water! When I ordered a lobster salad, ($35 on the menu) the waiter suggested he could make a larger salad that would be more of an entree size, and I said ""Sure!"" When I got the bill, I saw they charged me $100 for the salad! They could have informed me of this little price jump when offering the larger salad! Nice atmosphere, but this place is a huge ripoff.",Bad,Good,

The best ever!,,Good,
I've lived and visited NYC for over 40 years and have eaten at some of the finest restaurants the city has to offer and Nello's is unquestionably the biggest rip-off I've ever experienced in NYC or any other city. I guess if you're a celebrity and being comped  then its ok. But for the rest of us stay far away.,,Bad,
"i'm not sure what most of you folks think, but when you decide to walk into a place like nello on the east side you have to expect the price tag to go with it.  to think otherwise would be like walking into hermes and thinking you are going to pay GAP prices.  


it may not be for everyone, but when a pal and i ducked into nello, we were treated well and enjoyed the food.  there were indeed many pretty people inside, but there were many average folks as well.  i was wearing torn up adidas, cargo shorts, and a t-shirt, and no one gave me the once over or an attitude, nor did i feel out of place.  lunch was $143 and tasted great.  i would definitely go back.",Good,Good,Good
"There's a very simple solution to those on average incomes who are sitting here complaining about the prices... go elsewhere. Manhatten's filled with fast food joints that won't break the budget for those rearing children and on less-than-dazzling salaries.


I personally have no problem with the prices. I can afford to eat at Nello's on a very regular basis and not flinch at the prices. There is nothing wrong with spending good money on splendid food in such a serene atmosphere. The sheer beauty of Nello's is that it's relaxed and comfortable-- it's neither pretensious or arrogant the the restaurants that most of the nouveau rich dine at.


Nello's isn't an experience for those who are going to complain about the prices. After all, how well can you enjoy and appreciate excellent food if you're going to be biting your nails about the cost?",Good,Good,
"We also wandered in here on a Sunday afternoon and were shocked at the prices, but exhausted so decided to stay.  Ordered a bottle of sparkling water and resigned ourselves to spending big bucks for convenience.  Ordered a bottle of wine, but they were out of it, pushed a more expensive $100 bottle, which we tasted and it was off.  Ordered another under $100 bottle and again they were ""out of it"" -- again, they tried to push an over $100 bottle substitution.  Note that prices have gone UP since previous reviews -- a bowl of lobster bisque was $50 at lunch!  After our second wine failure we decided to cut our losses and leave -- asked for the check for the water -- $15!  What a total rip off -- outraegously expensive even for Upper East Side Manhattan.  Be warned!",Bad,Bad,
"We randomly wandered into the restaurant after walking on Madison Avenue and our legs were tired. It was very late afternoon but the place was packed and we initially felt lucky to have been offered the remaining table. That feeling was, of course, short-lived. Had we read any of the reviews prior to a planned visit, we would never have chosen this place. Read the other reviews for yourself. Here's mine.


The restaurant looks just like a casual cafe and we and that was our expectation. That changed when we went through the menu, which had choices of some simple salads for $23 - $27. Soup dishes were $16 - $20, not to mention the pasta section, to which I recall the least expensive item was a seafood spaghetti for $43, which we ordered. Yes, $43 for a spaghetti!


As we are normally willing to spend anything on a good meal, we shrugged off the prices and prepared ourselves for a very nice, sumptious lunch, only to be very shocked and disspointed at what this restaurant had to offer. So plain was the salad of several leaves of romaine I did not know what to make out of it. Then can the spaghetti - it was plain horrible. No better was it than a microwaveable meal you pick up from the forzen section of the supermarket!


We ended up paying over $200 for this sloppy meal for two people, of which was the poorest valued meal we have had. Surely, we have been to much more expensive places but had food and service that were equally befiitting of the price.


No less horrendous was the service. The waiters and waitresses at this place also demonstrate the most misplaced snobbery, as if people come in to ask them for charity meals. Upon leaving and handing over the ticket to retrieve our coat, we were brought somebody else's coats and belongings and they went back and couldn't find ours. We ended up in the cloakroom to dig through piles of coats and then finally locating ours beneath the unorganized pile.


My recommendation is go elsewhere. You won't miss a thing here. There are so many fantastic restauarants in NY one can only wonder how a place like this manages to stay in business.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"My fiance picked this place out of convenience since she works on Madison Avenue.  I am so angry I did not read any reviews before going.  The experience honestly depressed me for days!  The prices are completely outrageous, and the food completely average.  I've lived in New York since 1999 and I have never ever felt more ripped off for any meal or service here.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We cruised in on a Sunday afternoon.  The prices will make you laugh and then go into cardiac arrest.  Now sure it's New York and you expect high prices....goes with the territory.  What you don't expect is prices 30% to 40% higher than the New York prices to begin with, and then coupled with absolutely mediocre food!  The Lobster bisque soup, at lunchtime, was $32 a bowl.  I kid you not.  My wife and I had one item each, no drinks and I believe it was still around $55 bucks to get out of there.  Don't be fooled, it looks like a normal little bistro but it's made to sucker the tourist crowds and those who like to run with, or pose as, Eurotrash wealth sponges.  Never again!!  Spend you bucks at the Palm or Da Silvano...at least you will get excellent quality food and hopefully, pretty nice service.  This place was snooty and phony.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This place is a joke, but the joke is on the unsuspecting customer.  Nello's is a total, and absolute rip off.  i didn't know Nello's reputation, but just happened in.  I was about to leave after seeing some of the outrageous luncheon prices, when the  waiter urged me to try the lobster salad it was the ""special of the day""  Since the other salads were $23 dollars,(expensive, but it was Madison Avenue) or so, I decided to try it.  Heres what arrived:  dumped in the middle of a small plate was the tiniest salad I have ever been served.  It consisted of (counted): two endive leaves, jullienned, an artichoke leave cut in pieces, three slivers of fresh basil, approximately an eighth of a tomato, cubed, and six specks of lobster(none from the tail) with lemon dressing. Three forksful later, I finished this mediocre meal. I also ordered a small bottle of water(panna).  My Bill: $48!  There  was no justifying charging that much for a salad or eight dollars for a bottle of water found on any grocery store shelf.  I have never, ever been served such an insultingly measly dish.   I have dined in the finest restaurants in New york on special occasions. The exquisite Gotham Bar and Grill only charges $15 for a luncheon salad, and each is a work of art both visually and tastewise.  There was no way to know the price beforehand because it was not listed on the menu.  I can only surmise that the waiter, observing me turning away from the laughable prices on the entree page and looking at the salads, quickly offered the ""special"" without indicating that it was almost twice the price of those on the menu, because he wanted to make as much profit as possible, and, of course he would receive twice as much tip.  Don't waste your money.  There are literally hundreds of fine, affordable Italian restaurants in the city and boroughs.  They respect and value their customers.  Nello's, in my experience did not.",Bad,Bad,
"This is listed in the new Michelin guide. Big mistake. Zagat has it pegged. So OVERPRICED for pasta and Italian food it is in it's own catagory. Food is fair, service OK, so many better places to go. Charged us $15 to split a $35 pasta dish. Salads were around $24 and awful. Why is this place full???",Bad,Bad,Good
"And London is supposed to be expensive!  Nello's recommended by Four Seasons Hotel.  Smallish 'family' Italian; front open to busy road. Food perfectly adequate, nothing special; service also adequate.  Made the mistake of picking the Specials, without asking the price.  Two cold soups, two sole off the bone with spinach, bottle of Spring Water, bottle of Chilean White (at $75; the Californian ones were mostly over $100).  Price, with tax and service = $360!!! For that price, two can dine at some of the best restaurants in London - typically with 5 courses & 2 bottles of decent wine.  Disappointing.",Bad,Bad,
"I believe that this franchise even has one or another unit here in Brazil, but it is not so common. There in the US has everywhere, and it is definitely a good choice to eat hamburger. It‚Äôs not the best hamburger in life, but it‚Äôs definitely better than a McDonald‚Äôs.",Good,,

"DO NOT EAT HERE, especially if you are black. This place is run by Hispanics who do not like us nor do they care about the quality of the food they serve us. Not only did they give me old food, they tried to defend the food they gave me and they argued with me before attempting a resolution. I calmly explained to the manager that my food wasn‚Äôt satisfactory and he gave me an attitude and said ‚Äúeverything we do is correct‚Äù. You could tell that both the burgers and the fries were pre-made as they were very oily and tasted old. I have eaten here plenty of times, I know what the food tastes like. He then proceeded to call security (who apologized for coming because they saw I was calm and was clearly right). They gave us our food within 5 minutes and when we reminded them of that, they said that‚Äôs normal because they make food fast. And talk about unprofessional, they tried to gang up on us, even having one of the cooks come from the back to yell that the food was fine. Eventually they decided to make another burger to show us how fast it was, it took 5 minutes for the burger alone and that freshly cooked burger looked nothing like the ones served. They were proven wrong but they still didn‚Äôt apologize and they were still rude. I got tired of being treated this way so I left but I will be calling corporate. I just wanted my money back, but I was told I ate too many bites. The photos are here. Clearly I didn‚Äôt eat this crap",Bad,Bad,Bad

"The burgers hear are good, the fries we ordered had jalapenos on it they were fresh and spicy. 
The service  was good, the waiter was nice and fast.
The only problem I would say was the price for the pop $5 for a soda is a little pricy for me. If you go get a shake it is worth more.",Good,Good,Good

"We always visit Johnny Rockets when in Hollywood, and each time the food and shakes are exactly the same and fantastic. The service is so quick and staff are always polite and friendly.  There is no better place for a quick and tasty burger and shake.",Good,Good,Good
we were looking for a quick bite and this place was fast but the food so greasy even the chili fries and man were they over priced,Bad,,Good
Fantastic spot for brunch/lunch after a long flight. Service was excellent and great food if you are after a burger/ wings/ hotdogs. Lovely Authentic American Diner. Close to all Hollywood attractions and a view of the Hollywood sign from the balcony.,Good,Good,Good
"Fast service, enjoyable burger, philly steak sandwich both served with fries in a traditional American diner.",Good,,Good
"Retro decor for a real taste of ‚Äòold America‚Äô takes you back and feels like you‚Äôre on the set of Happy Days! 
Portions are good and not overfacingly humongous. Staff as everywhere in the States are cheerful and efficient.",Good,Good,Good
We had to ate a burger during our stay in LA and it was a great choice to do it here at Johnny Rockets in Hollywood and Highlands Center. The place is like in a Hollywood movie.,,Good,
I had read reviews about this place so we ate there.  The burgers are at least $10 and then it's an extra $5 for a fries.  The burger was just an average burger and the patty was rather thin.  I would suggest a going somewhere else for a better burger.,Bad,,
"Went for breakfast daily while in LA.  Extra Large portions, great food, great service


Service was friendly and quick, food being delivered in under 10 minutes which was amazing",Good,Good,Good
Good environment in 50s style. Burger good but nothing more. Chips with cheddar not so good. Maybe I happened on a wrong spot but I expected more. Nothing special for me,Good,Good,
"It was our last day in LA, the family decided to visit Johhny Rockets in Hollywood for the diner experience. The food was quite tasty, however very small in size for the price. The service was good to begin with however we all received our sides first which I thought was strange, they then gave us our burgers, at this stage I still hadn't received my shake and asked our waitress to grab them as I could see them sitting up on the shelf. She waited another 5mins before  getting our shakes, I ended up finishing my burger before receiving my drink which I thought was poor. There was a total of 6 or 7 employees with one making all the food and one waitress doing all the work whereas the other 3 or 4 were standing around drinking and chatting looking very unprofessional (explains the delayed service). Average diner.",Good,Good,Good
"Was a nice surprise finding this here as had been to a branch in SF many years previously so bought back some happy memories !  Food was great, portions were large as with most american restaurants.  Service was polite and friendly and they even supplied takeaway cups for my daughter which were a nice momento.  Felt it was a little pricey - but we are in LA !",Good,Good,Good
Small place with really tasty burgers. Service was fast and food was good. Also enjoyed a chocolate malted milkshake.,Good,Good,Good
"We came for a quick bite to eat for a late lunch and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, we all had something different, but I went for the original and for me it is up there with the best burgers, not too big or small. The kids and wifey had shakes and they were superb!",Good,Good,
This throwback to burger hop days has a nice family environment. Food here was good and the staff was very friendly. The original burger reminded me of an In and Out style burger. The food came out quickly and was hot and tasty. I would recommend to anyone who is in Hollywood and looking for a good dining experience.,Good,Good,Good
We went to Hollywood late one night craving something sweet and ended up at Johnny Rockets. I had never been before this night but I had heard many good reviews. It did not disappoint. We got fries and shakes and we were left satisfied and a little leftover of each for the next day!,Good,Good,Good
"The service was really great, all the staff did a dance in the restaurant which was really fun. The food was great, they have lots of options including ‚Äòcreate your own‚Äô which allowed me to build my perfect burger. Would definitely come back!",Good,Good,Good
"Very busy restaurant, not surprising given the location, we got one of the only free tables when we visited.


Service was friendly and quick, food being delivered in under 10 minutes which was amazing considering how busy they were.


The food was also very good, best burgers we have had in a long time.",Good,Good,Good
I enjoyed lunch here.  It was very busy but the service was still prompt.  The food is okay but nothing super.,Good,,Good
"Just walking past the looks of this place from what we had seen on the movies just said come on in.
Service was great, meals large so we ordered kids meals which were great.
A very clean place and friendly staff plus a photo to top our time off here",Good,Good,Good
Visited Jonny Rockets on the first day of our stay in Hollywood. very nice diner and clean. Staff are friendly and fast service. Prices add up quite quick but portion sizes are big! Would return burgers were nice with fresh ingredients.,Good,Good,Good
"I had high expectations of this palce as I‚Äôd eaten in Johnny Rockets elsewhere. Sadly, despite Good from our waitress, this one disappointed. The food was below average.",Bad,Bad,Good
"On your next visit to Hollywood Blvd, step back in time and enjoy a burger, shake and fries in a 50's diner setting. With exceptional food, friendly service, upbeat music and a complimentary family photo to remember your experience, you won't be disappointed - so don't forget to tip the waiter.",Good,Good,Good
"Complete with the classic tunes and retro 50's-esque environment, the burgers, fries, and shakes only compliment the experience that this Johnny Rockets has to offer. When you order your food you see it being cooked before your eyes if you're sitting at the bar or from afar if you're sitting in one of the retro style booths. 


Johnny Rockets menu: Burgers, Sandwiches, Fries, Shakes, Hot-dogs, etc. If you're going to order a main entree, such as a burger, hot-dog, Philly cheese steak, and others - the great thing about that is that they are accommodated with fries.


You really can't go wrong at the Rocket.",Good,Good,
"Stopped for lunch at this restaurant while in Hollywood.  It was busy, but not swamped.  We ordered a soda, a water, a burger, fries, and a chicken sandwich and we were seated at the counter.  It took more than an hour for the food to be delivered.  The wait staff was all over the place, not tending to their stations or their customers.  The meal cost $40 and it was an extremely unsatisfying experience.  I will not return to Johnny Rockets.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Good hamburgers and sallads. The service varies depending on who is serving you but they definitely offer Good. Love the place, remindes me on American movies.",Good,Good,Good
"Had a lovely burger here while staying in LA. Was quick, reasonably priced & good size portions. Liked the ketchup smiley! Had our photos taken by the restaurant photographer, who offered the prints for $10 each initially & when we said no, she said we could have all 3 for $5 so worth holding out if you want them! Only downside was I ordered a milkshake that didn‚Äôt arrive until way after I‚Äôd finished my main & was ready to leave.",Good,Good,Bad
"Burgers here are amazing, service. Not so good but well worth visiting if you‚Äôre looking for the perfect burger.",Good,,Bad
Enjoyed our meal in the diner style of the 50s. The burgers and shakes were delicious and staff were very friendly.,Good,Good,Good
"Having never been to a Johnny Rockets before, we searched this place out in the mall.  Reminds you of a 1950's diner.  We sat at the bar.  There's a jukebox in front of you that you can play for a nickel.  Ordered the Johnny Rockets original burger, and it was delicious, much better than the one I had at Shake Shack earlier in the week.  The ocolate Shake was great, but $7.49?  Had the cheesy tater tots, and wished I hadn't.  $23.00 for a burger, shake, and fries is rather steep, but when on vacation...  If you park at the mall, they will validate your parking ticket.",Good,Good,
"The location is the mall on the corner of Hollywood and Highland so if your checking out the Walk of Fame and getting hungry, it‚Äôs a nice place to grab a quick bite. 


They didn‚Äôt do any singing and dancing as some Johnny Rockets do but they did bring the food to the table. Service was quick & friendly. Food was standard for this fast food joint. I had one of the salads and enjoyed it. 


The only annoying thing was they had someone there hitting you up to get a picture done and then trying to sell you a package. It‚Äôs Hollywood I guess, but I found this quite intrusive.",Good,,Good
"If you're on a nostalgia trip looking at the names and footprints on Hollywood Boulevard, what's better than a snack in a '50s style burger bar?
Staff were friendly and attentive, service was prompt and out two excellent burgers and soft drinks came to $31...good value.
Recommended.",Good,Good,Good
Huge meals but not up to our tastes tonight. Felt that our meals were a little too oily and were just ok. The milkshakes looked amazing and had jealously of the people beside us! Not as good as other Johnny Rockets but fast service and great atmosphere,Bad,Good,Good
The burgers and fries were so fresh and delicious. The staff were great and ensured you had everything you needed for an awesome meal,Good,,Good
"Not a fan of burger restaurants, but the food here was good, as well as the shakes.  Great staff, always smiling.",Good,,Good
Went to Johnny's for my first meal in LA and I can say it started really well. The burger was delicious and the fries with cheese were mind blowing tasteful.,Good,,
"I really enjoyed dining here... the food was great as well as the milkshakes! A bit disappointed that the mini juke box on our table didn't work, but oh well...!


The only thing I didn't like was being hassled to buy photographs. A young girl offered us a free photo, but of course there was a catch when she then started her spiel about buying a set of photographs. We were pretty adamant that we didn't want to purchase any, but she kept lowering the price until we paid a ridiculous price for them.


In hindsight, it's a nice souvenir to have, but we didn't enjoy the experience. To her credit, she was actually quite nice, despite our stubborness!


I still recommend Johnny Rockets for the food and the step back in time!",Good,Bad,
"We went for both lunch and dinner, food was fresh and always tasty.  Best ever milkshakes and I loved the hotdog.  Service was friendly.",Good,,Good
"this is a great venue for that good tasting hamburger and fries 
we  loved the milk shakes well worth going to eat there",Good,,
"Me and me Family were visiting hollywood boulevard and it was raining a lot
We enter the restaurant and the lady didnt host us because we supposed to wait outside, ON THE RAIN
Than explained very uneducated with us
This is sad because we like this franchise
But we will neve come back",,Bad,Bad
"If you are looking for a great diner experience this is the place to come.
Good and friendly service. 
If in the neighbourhood will come back.",Good,Good,Good
we went here and it was very busy the service was great and the food was even better would recommend Johnny Rockets to any one you can eat in or get take away,Good,Good,Good
"They were really busy when I arrived w/ limited staff.  I ordered onion rings and a burger and a soda. My onion rings were cooked by my server, forgot her name, but she was very fast, friendly and efficient. The food is delicious, but it didn't come w/ any sides. It is pricey, but so is everything else in that touristy area.",Good,,Good
"Been here before but won‚Äôt go again. The food is ok but not that fresh. Expensive for what we got!  $50 for two and it was just a burger and a chilli dog. 
However the shakes were fantastic.
Would I recommend it? No! There‚Äôs far better around",Bad,,
"We loved the Burgers and bottomless Cokes.  Fast, very  friendly service.  The place is decked out like a 1950's Diner.  We were disappointed to hear this is the only Johnny Rockets left in LA.",Good,Good,Good
We visited and had bacon cheeseburgers which are quarter pounders- you can double up if you want to but we didn‚Äôt need to - we also shared some cheesy bacon chips which were great and had coke zeros - food was great!!,Good,,
"We visited this restaurant twice during our visit. Both times we went after very busy days and this restaurant is close to our hotel. The first visit was 5 star - waiter was wonderful, service quick, and burgers fresh and made to our liking. Second visit was 1 star - we waited 20 minutes outside the restaurant for seats to become available because the restaurant was very busy. When we got seats at the bar, the waitress took our order and we did not wait too long for the burgers. I asked for mine medium well and it came out like a hockey puck. the bottom layer was charred and very hard. I asked the waitress to just bring me a new patty that was not burnt. She insisted on taking the whole burger and I watched the cook throw both burgers in the trash. There was nothing wrong with the other ingredients. I got upset at the food waste. About ten minutes later 2 new burgers were brought this time the bun was burnt. We ate what we could and just left. This clearly was an off night because we went earlier in the visit and it was really good. However, we spend $38 bucks plus $6 tip on 2 burgers, 1 shared fry, and 2 soft drinks. I feel like this is a lot of money not to get what you want. I am going to have to pass on this restaurant in the future.",,Bad,
"Burgers are to write about, oh so good enjoyed the onion rings too.....can't get over how fast the orders are made, sitting at the bar watching the cooks is awesome, excellent place for lunch....only thing was the girl taking pictures was kind of a pain in the butt. We didn't want the pictures and she would keep coming back to try and sell them again. No thanks usually means NO.",Good,Good,
It's your typical Johnny Rockets but it's in a cool location. After you get your burger and shake you can sit outside and relax and enjoy the view as you watch the Hollywood Blvd shenanigans. It's not usually crowded and it's a good view since it's on the second floor.,Good,Good,
"First time really only wanted a drink but decided to eat as well. Bright, loud & brash 50s style diner. Service a bit slow but OK once started. The burgers are very nice & as I'm on a low carb diet can be done skinny, in other words no bun! The wings were tasty & quite spicy. The fries which arrive first are biggish portions but very nice. Second time I had a salad & a burger as well. Not cheap but then it is the centre of LA in Hollywood.",Good,Good,
"Looking for a piece off the 50's and a great meal. This is the place to go. Friendly staff, fresh food and good prices.
A true Hollywood favorit, we will be back.",Good,Good,Good
We love Johnny Rockets and the Hollywood Blvd did not disappoint.  The burgers and hakes are brilliant. If you are looking for a quick bite to eat then head up to Johnny Rocks and Grab a Shake and Burger.,Good,Good,
"We ate here on our first night in LA we were exhausted after an 11 hour flight and just wanted something quick and this was only a minute from our hotel.
The theeming is fun and the service is fast and friendly.  We orderd a burger each and a portion of fries each, we really only needed one portion of fries as they were so big.  We really enjoyed the burgers they were tasty and hot.",Good,Good,Good
"Very Good and big meals.
There best side dish is sweet potato
The restaurant look likes casual American restaurant and I recommend to everyone who walk on Hollywood to eat there",Good,Good,Good
We have been here before but it was perfect place to sit down for lunch after walking up and down the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  Hollywood in August is hot and crowded so finishing our lunch with milkshakes was a much needed treat,Good,Good,
We ate here for dinner one night. Service was good but we found the burgers to be pretty average and the fries really oily. Wouldn't be rushing back..,,,Good
"Located in the second floor in the shopping complex on Hollywood Blvd you can find the nostalgic restaurant. It catches your attention as soon as you see it. We picked it for breakfast around 9am before things got busy. The ordering aspect of our meal was fast and we got brought our food very quick as well, but the server (Only 1 for an entire restaurant?) did not come back to check on us, and took about 20 mins to get us the bill. It sort of put a bad taste in my mouth, he was too busy talking to someone at the counter to come check on the guests (another table was waiting too), can't be good for your tips. Anyway, decent visit, cool 50s diner vibe, simple menu and good music.",,Good,
"This place was good as was the service.  We got hamburgers, tator tots and french fries.  It was in a mall on the Hollywood Walk of Fame so very convenient!",Good,Good,Good
"Had chili cheese fries, one of the things I love most about America. Friendly staff and Good with the sort of food you would expect.",Good,,Good
"Our 2nd night in Hollywood and we wanted a reasonably priced, tasty feed. so we headed here and certainly weren't disappointed. I had the new A1 burger and yes, it is an A! choice, delicious!",Good,,
This is a family favorite wherever we are visiting. Delicious burgers after long days on our feet sightseeing. Excellent shakes. Service was wonderful!,Good,Good,Good
The shakes here are amazing (not good for the hips! Lol). I brought my family here to experience the old fashioned Diner. Food is always good.,Good,Good,
"It is a great place to eat, it is great for families, it is like eating at an old fashioned diner, this was our first time to Hollywood and this is one of the great memories",Good,Good,
Love this place. Fast food and fast service. The name describes at least half of the business. Thanks!!,Good,Good,Good
"While the decor is reminiscent of traditional American diner, I was in general underwhelmed. Convenient location but noisy. The waitress wanted to sit me at the bar as I was alone, but as an older traveller with a bad back, I was not going to perch on a stool. She didn't seem too happy about my request to sit at a table, especially as the only tables available were set for four.
My chicken salad was good, but the dressing came in a plastic sachet. Once it was served there was no follow up. I had to call the waitress' attention when I wanted something else.",,Bad,Bad
"Have been here before when visiting LA.
Burgers are good which quite a range to choose from.
We had the Rocket single and the Smoke house.
Both really good, not too large and quite flavoursome.
Price good. 
Service really good.
If you want something quick and easy with no fuss this is the place.",Good,Good,Good
"A fun little and very traditional American diner set in a shopping centre and overlooking the Hollywood Walk of Fame etc. Take yourself back to the Fifties with a bite of brunch. And get your feet tapping from the table-side juke boxes. Food's fine and fresh, too.",Good,Good,
Cute little diner in the shopping mall of hollywood. Awesome rocking atmosphere and great service. Food was delivered quickly. Milkshakes are amazing!,Good,Good,Good
I tried to route 66 burger and it's delicious. The French fries portion is more than enough for 1 person. I really loved this place with a typical American decoration,Good,Good,
"We ate here twice in our short stay in Hollywood. Both times we had excellent food and service. The menu was quite extensive, a lot to choose from. No alcohol is served here, only soft drink, milkshakes, juice and water. It is set up like an old fashioned diner, and there were jukeboxes on some of the tables, but unfortunately these weren't working at the time.",Good,Good,Good
"Needed a quick bite to satisfy our late night hunger. Known for burgers and shakes, it diner food at it fastest and finest. Tip: Must try the Cheesesteak Loaded Tater-tots and a Strawberry Chocolate shake! Yummy!!!",Good,,
The only reason they don‚Äôt have a 5 is because they don‚Äôt have s bathroom and you have to walk quite a distance to sketch area to use a restroom. Food was great place was clean.,Good,Good,
Our waiter was a very friendly chap but oh dear the food was awful! As a family we ordered three different burgers and each was shockingly greasy and dripped oil.,Bad,,Good
I love the milkshakes here! The burgers are great too. Convenient place to have lunch if you're in the Dolby theatre area.,Good,Good,
Very good burgers and price. The service was very quick and the burgers are massive with everything you need. The fries were loaded as well. Parking is a issue and busy street but the place and staff are every good.,Good,,Good
Service was slow at first since it appeared there was only one server working when we came in. Once he was able to take our order everything went well. The onion rings were great. I would recommend this place.,Good,Good,Good
"Time travel to a 50's soda shop!  Food, music, atmosphere!  This is a chain, there are more than one of these.",Good,Good,
Good burgers fast service and friendly staff. Speaks for itself. Had the loaded chilly fries with my burger and they were great.,Good,Good,Good
"This place is fast, the food is fresh and the staff were very friendly...what more can you ask for! There are burgers and more burgers, with fries on the side, unlimited fries even. There are also cute little table top juke boxes, with some Aussie representation even. It‚Äôs a 50s diner style joint not fine dining.",Good,Good,Good
"Hi guys, 


I normally take longer to write about an experience so I have the time to reflect on it and really be fair with the place I am writing about. This time, I can't wait. 


Because we had a good memory of the place (we went with my wife a couple of years ago). Now we have comeback to Los Angeles with our kids we decided to take them to Johnny Rockets in Hollywood. 


First it was a nightmare to park the car but we finally decided to enter Hollywood & Highland Parking. After entering there we found out that if you go to have lunch or buy something in some selected stores or restaurants they validate your parking ticket and you have to pay only 2 USD for your first two hours. That was good!


We looked for Johnny Rockets and entered to have a nice lunch there. I asked for a club sandwich that was around 11 USD cost and my wife for something I can't even describe. 


Everybody knows what a Club Sandwich is and how it comes, normally 2 to 4 triangules of nice bread, with several nice ingredientes like chicken or turkey with lettuce, tomato, bacon, etc and also comes with Fries.


When they brought me the sandwich I could not be more disappointed. Not triangules of bread, no fries and a very small plate witch mean a very small sandwich for 11 dollars. Taste was ok but was also cooked with a lot of oil or butter which made the sandwich very heavy. I finish it and although it was small I had stomach ache almost immediately. 


Apart from the food with was not acceptable, the place was untidy, a little dirty and also for example our table seats looked bad and the leather in the sit was broken. 


Apart of not enjoying the meal that was not the end of the story. A woman (employee) came in the middle of this ""delicious"" meal and said she would give us a complimentary picture. Ok, I new that there was a catch but my kids insisted and we let her take the pictures. After a while she shows up again with or complimentary pictures and 6 more saying that we could by one for a number of dollars but also 6 per 30 USD. I said not and she said ok you can take the six without a paper frame that look good but not so great for 20. I said no again and she said 15, no again and 10. No again and she finally said all pictures for 5 USD. It was less than a dollar per picture so I said fine. 


Guys, this person was trying to sell me 6 pictures for 20 USD and it ended up seeing them for 5. After paying the 5 I though that is not acceptable to sell them for 20 which is a crazy price. 


As yu can see, the whole experience was not good and also cost us 50 USD without dessert and because my kids do not like soda drinks. 


This place is located in Hollywood, in the place where many movies are suppose to be done and they should have the highest standards and I can tell you I did not see them today at all. 


My recommendation is you should not go at all to this place. 


In the night we went to a Denny's and it was 38 USD having a much better and less precious meal. 


Regards!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Dropped by this place when first visiting Hollywood and had no expectations for the food. The price felt a big high when first glancing the menu but we still ordered a bunch of burgers and fries and wow, where they good! The burgers were simply perfect, all of their components very well executed and in a perfect harmony. This is how a hamburger should be like, great raw materials and all components working well together. We ate at two other of their locations later during our visit and they all held the same high quality, although the prices seemed slightly different in each, Hollywood being the most expensive. The best ‚Äùfast food‚Äù type of burgers this far.",Good,,
This restaurant offers a great atmosphere and the food is very well prepared and ready to go. The staff was friendly and helpful and their service excellent. It is well located in a busy shopping mall and easy within reach of a hunger traveler. The onion rings and hamburger were delicious and the price was reasonable. This restaurant has a relaxed atmosphere.,Good,Good,Good
"It really seems to be in the 50's - 60's in there, and we loved the atmosphere. Kind waiters and waitresses, they made us feel very comfortable.
The burgers were great and big, prices are in the LA average.",Good,Good,Good
I like to get there hamburger and onion rings. My son-in-law liked the chicken salad.  It is a retro place where you can get an 50 style burger.,Good,Good,
"Price Level is a bit higher here in Hollywood but the Burgers are fine, made quick to your taste. Always a safe joice",Good,Good,
"What I would consider a common food in an American cuisine would be burgers and I ate lots of it while being there. The Route 66 burger was what I would have considered one of the best burgers after trying out so many. We also had the chili cheese fries but was relatively boring compared to the burger. Atmosphere was a bit like a fast food chain, but the total bill came up to USD 24 for that one burger and sides so don't expect fast food prices.


Separately, a guy came up to offer free postcard photos - we understood from the waiter that the company leases a small space from Johnny Rockets to do that, so don't be alarmed (as we were, given that it is a touristy place) if approached!",Good,,
We stopped at Johnny Rockets in Hollywood before taking a shuttle back to our hotel. Since we were on a tight schedule they made sure we got our meal very quickly so we wouldn‚Äôt miss our bus. I have to say my burger was very tasty!  I would definitly recommand this place and will go back for sure!,Good,Good,
Holidaying from Australia for 2 months with wife. We loved this place to eat for a quick & cheap meal. Was great to go back in time when life growing up was simpler. The vibe & feeling is awesome listening to all the old music your parents may have listened to growing up in the 50/60's era. Milkshakes are to die for so yummm. As we ate here most nights we tried just about every flavour. Food is huge you really do only need to order 1 meal to share.,Good,Good,Good
"No matter where you go a Johnny Rockets is the place to eat...all meals.  The food is fabulous, the staff is always kind and friendly, the service is fast as well.  Love Johnny Rockets!",Good,Good,Good
"Fun place to take the Kids or Visitors.  Johnny Rockets recreates that 50's dinner vibe with hamburgers, fries, hot dogs, etc. and Milk Shakes.",,Good,
The food was fast and tasted good. The staff where nice and friendly. The only bad thing about it was that it's  expensive for the food I got.,,,Good
Stopped in for an early dinner. The meal for the price was average. My Philly cheese steak was greasy. My son liked the chicken tenders.,Bad,,
"Stopped by for a quick feed before heading to the Observatory.  Ordered shakes, onion rings and fries.  The shakes were okay (the strawberry and banana shake wasn't blended properly and was rather chunky), the fries bland.  The onion rings were the saving grace.",Bad,,
Basically we got an average takeaway meal at a restaurant price. Food was over cooked. Staff gave us a lame reason why we couldn't be seated right away. ( half the tables were empty). Staff seemed disinterested. Probably could lose the photographer. We all have cameras these days and tend to document our own lives. Place needs a big refresh.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"We are LA natives and I've been to many Johnny Rockets. You can always count on Johnny R's for quality food - great burgers, crispy fries, delish real ice cream shakes and friendly service. But the service at this location was seriously the best I've ever had at Johnny R's and one of the best, warmest, friendliest I've had at any diner in recent memory. We were greeted immediately and sat at the counter. The lovely chatty waiter (whose name I'm so sorry I've forgotten, but he was a tall, thin asian man with a wonderful disposition) was kind, funny and checked on us regularly. We never had a moment when a water glass went empty or couldn't get a side of ranch or felt like we were being hurried along. Even when it got busy in there and he was hopping from the register to the counter to the tables. I'm a hospitality professional and honestly, this guy and his team treated us as well as if we were at a fine dining establishment. He started our night off right! I had to take a moment to mention here. Anyone and everyone who wants a casual experience, inexpensive and excellent diner food and topped off with great service, you can't beat this Johnny Rockets. Who would have thought it... There are many casual restaurants in this area, but the next time we're here for a show and want a simple dinner, we will go out of our way to visit here.",Good,Good,Good
We had lunch here and it was lovely I had salad but be warned it was massive. But gorgeous and they packed it up for me to have later. The service was great and food milkshake to die for. Would highly recommend they was always on top of things cleaning all the time lovely atmosphere too.,Good,Good,Good
"This particular diner had the best burger, fries and onion rings we had in California. The service was brilliant, friendly and very professional. After bringing our drinks order, the waiter took our food order. We did not have to wait long for the onion rings, and shortly after the main order. We enjoyed our meal very much and would recommend eating there.  It was not too expensive and so good for families",Good,Good,Good
"It's not the most friendly restaurant, but it's still Johnny Rockets, and although it's very bad for you, their chili cheese fries are the best in combination with The Original burger, love these places. The one at Universal Studios is rated the best if you ask me.",Good,Good,
We really enjoyed this burger and were particularly pleased to find that the fries were sold separately so we could share fries. After 2 weeks of American portions it was good to order less and be able finish a meal and even consider a desert.,Good,Good,
"While discovering Hollywood and LA with how on how off busses, we started the day with breakfast here. Toast with fried eggs between and coffee. Very good. And we also had our lunch here in the form of hamburgers and French fries. All food was very good. Also the service was very good.",Good,,Good
I was recommended to come here by my sister. The service was fast the mushroom burger delicious and the atmosphere was great as well as the service. A lady comes around to take your pics $20 lol. My son enjoyed his kids hot dogs.,Good,Good,Good
"The Johnny Rockets in Hollywood is a good place to stop for a snack or a meal.  Try the milkshakes, they are delicious.",Good,Good,
"Good choice on the menu, staff were all friendly, large portions and the food tasted great. Our son loved his milk shake.",Good,Good,Good
"Olds schools, I have to come again! Great service, good prizes. Cheap, about 10$ per burger.. So delicious!",Good,Good,Good
"Johnny Rockets in Hollywood is a great time. Their burgers, fries and shakes are fantastic.


The atmosphere is fun and relaxing. You can eat at a cute counter or in nice tables. It is a 50's type place and a chain, all look pretty much alike. They are cute with super friendly service and the food is always fresh and super tasty.


If you have kids with you they will love it.",Good,Good,Good
"We were here very late, service still bright and friendly. Great venue ! Best milk shakes ever. Hamburgers delicious .",Good,Good,Good
Great place with quick and friendly service. But please quit the photographer. The waiter was very attentive with refilling our softdrinks.,,Good,Good
"We needed a place to grab a quick dinner after completing a Hollywood tour. We were seated immediately and our waiter was very friendly. He was prompt with taking our order and with refilling our drinks. The food came very quickly and was delicious. We were in and out in less than 30 minutes. Delicious food, friendly and fast service, and decent prices ( more then McDonalds but less then the Hard Rock Cafe downstairs ) We will be back!",Good,Good,Good
That right this JR serves breakfast and it was good for a place that deals with burgers and shakes. The price wasn't bad neither.,Good,,
"And that is pretty much it. The fifties style is touristic enough, but the food is poor and overpriced - we paid $11 for a plain burger with no extras, fries, drinks, anything. They offered to validate our parking ticket, but they did not. It was rushed and very crowded. The jukebox did not work. The service was rushed - clearly they need more hands. The location is all that this place has.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Popped into here for a dining experience whilst visiting the Hollywood area.  Initially very welcoming but then left for a bit too long with the menus. Sadly, didn't have everything that was on offer in them.  Drinks came out with chips and then another wait before the burgers.  I realise it was mid afternoon on a hot day but the waitress wasn't helpful or even friendly which spoiled out visit.  Food ok but overpriced for what it was, seating limited space in the booth, even with our lack of shopping!  The thing that upset me was when I asked the waitress about the restroom she sent me down the mall to coded toilets (without the code). We'd been out all day and as there was no cutlery &I wanted to wash hands before eating.  Gave up in the end.  Save your money-it wasn't that good, try another food outlet.  As for the toilets and the helpful, friendly team - try the D&G gaming across the other side of the mall!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I know that the restaurant is known for its hamburgers and shakes, but you really need to try the cheesesteak.  The roll was toasted and the extras included saut√©ed onions and peppers.  The steak was shaved prime rib.  Fantastic!  The place was decorated like a 1950's diner with a juke box that I'm not sure actually worked.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Our server recommend that our son try one of the milkshakes which was rich and creamy.  The hamburgers were very good.  This was a fun atmosphere.",Good,Good,Good
"The chicken tenders that I had were good and waiting staff were very friendly. The reason for my rating of 3 is due to the persistent photographer. After telling her that I didn't want to buy the photographs that she had taken, she continually came back to our table with a new bartered down price. Being the stubborn person that I am, I didn't back down and buy them from her. I was at a restaurant, not a theme park! 


I think if Johnny Rockets stopped the complimentary photos and just asked diners to share their photos via social media then people will have a more enjoyable meal.",Good,Bad,Good
It was the end of a fantastic day but it made the day slip. I received the wrong milkshake for start and then some random photographer came up to us and took pictures and didn't tell us why although they where nice pictures the burgers where small and bit the best tbh the best but was the milkshake. Overall meh.,Bad,Bad,
"His Johnny Rockets has a long line that goes outside and yet above just above the Chinese Theater. 


I sat at the bar to avoid a wait.


I ordered the Houston burger which had a chipotle sauce. It was a likely spicy.


The burgers are made to order in front of your eyes.


This franchisee does a good job.",Good,Good,Good
"Lovely place to grab a burger had the bacon burger and Philli cheese steak along with the rocket dog served at our table, can't begin to say how sensational the taste of the Philly cheese steak was and the others enjoyed the burger and dog. The restaurant was very clean even though the place was very busy and the staff were exceptionally polite",Good,Good,Good
We enjoyed a variety of burgers here. They were all delicious. Staff were really friendly and helpful and coped well with our ignorance of how the whole system worked.,Good,,Good
"I came with 5 friends to get a burger and a shake. The shake was $7 and the burger was $10 with out fries. The waitress refused to split the check individually because ""It's too much trouble"". She told us to just split our fries and she would do three tickets. After all that trouble she managed to completely screw up the items on each check. She was not friendly and she did not even think to apologize.",,,Bad
"Last year when I tested Johnny rockets it was way more better, but it was not in the same place.  This restaurant did not have sweet potato fries.  The milkshake was good.",,,
A $10.00 burger should have more atmosphere associated with it. The onion rings were bland and the dipping sauce was nothing special. I was disappointed as it did not live up to the hype.,Bad,,
"Stopped here and had a reasonable burger meal with my family. The girl taking the ""free"" photos clearly in league with the waiter. When we didn't buy the originally over priced and unwanted pictures, our parking ticket was not validated meaning our parking cost $7 rather than $2. Sad really as not necessary and a cheap shot.",,Bad,
"Our party of 4--two grandparents and two grandsons--paused for lunch on our tour of Hollywood Blvd.  It was 11:45 a.m. so we beat the rush for lunch on a Saturday in July.  We chose to eat at the counter, because even at that hour, tables were scarce. The food was good, but because of the numbers of diners, it took a while to get our food.  There aren't many restaurants in this location that offer a younger menu, so we think we chose wisely.",Good,Good,
Came to LA and stayed at the Loew hotel with the big shopping mall. I ate here everyday for a week and a half. The food was great Everytime. From regular beef burgers to veggie bean burgers. I loved them all. Fries great too. Only thing I would change is the lady walking around taking pics and offering to sale them to you. I hate stuff like that,Good,Bad,
"We were visiting the area for the first time and weren't sure where to get breakfast.  This restaurant was a nice surprise.  The service was great and the prices were great even though the restaurant is in a high tourist area.  Large portions.  We both got omelets, which came with tater tot like potatoes, and toast.  Good coffee.  Would definitely go again.",Good,Good,Good
"Popped in quite late in evening.. service quite quick and food coming out seemed even quicker.
Food was nice.. menu is average burger joint nothing special.
Average prices.",Good,,Good
"Johnny Rockets still puts out the best American Burger. Best Malts! Best Fries.  They must have the best training, because every store I visit in LA is exactly the same, GREAT! Do not be surprised if there is a line, but the wait is well worth it for sure.",Good,Good,
"We got hungry and it was there calling at us! We had loaded Tatter tots followed by clubs sandwiches. The tots were good, we don't really get these in the UK so it was a it of a novelty. The sandwiches were also ok. Not our usual haunt as it's a bit too mainstream for us but it filled a hole & stoped is from eating each other.",Good,,
Visited Johnny Rockets this afternoon. The Houston Burger was ok and my wife's Bacon and Cheese Fries were fine. Nothing to right home about,,,
"Nice place, service with friendly and food hit the spot. Just didn't like being pushed into having my photo taken that I was told was ""complimentary"" but on her return attempted to sell us photos starting at 10 and then dropping to as low as 2$. Trying to forcefully sell overpriced photos was bad enough but the look she threw us when leaving.. we wont return",Good,Bad,Good
"Wanted to rate this more than average and less than very good. Service friendly and it has an ok atmosphere. Food was served quickly, burgers were tasty, fries were ordinary. Milkshakes are impressive. Prices are expensive but so is everything in the tourist precinct.",Good,,Good
"Lots of places to eat in Hollywood, but we wanted burgers and fries.  We found Johnny Rockets on the second floor of the Mall up from the Chinese Theater.  Retro 50's look inside with REALLY good burgers and honest to gosh milkshakes.  Good and better than usual fast food.",Good,Good,Good
"It's a franchise, yes. But this location was quick to seat, serve and respond. Right off Hollywood Blvd, the menu sports calories that made me opt for the chicken sandwich. Ok, and I had the tater tots - delicious. Would definitely come again. Had a very good waitress.",Good,Good,Good
Was really looking forward to this but the service was terrible. Being British I stupidly asked for black tea which pretty well most places do ok but the water was barely warm. We weren't given water and the food was average. Not what I though a us diner would be,Bad,,Bad
"I have been known to go to this place in the Santa Anita Mall. When we go to the movies.
Generally it is hot, fresh, brown and plenty of it.",Good,Good,
"I have eaten at johnny rockets  before. I hate to complaine that the prices at this location can be termed tourist prices. no combos. they just nickle and dime you here. were I live I can get a cheese burger fries and drink for seven dollars. this place is way too expensive, but a better location than the mcds down the block where the homeless have taken over. never again will I eat here. its a drain on my wallet.",Bad,Good,
"After Dan TDM
Just flew into L.A. and I rushed to the Dolby theater to see my son celebrate his 5th birthday at the Dan TDM show. Though I have no idea what I witnessed, I was hungry so the family came to eat to Johnny Rockets. Family had eaten so I ordered Smoke House Double (With avocado) with onion rings. For the record Cali, heavy Texans don't appreciate you placing the calorie count next to what we order. The burger was fresh and juicy. The onion rings heavily breaded so not a good combo. The waiter was friendly yet I still pondered....what did I just see the last 2 hours. Good at $21. Oh, you'll get a free tourist foto but careful they will try to sell you 3 for $30....yes I fell for it....turn around, extend arm and drop the mic.",Good,Good,Good
Go for house smoke double and chilli fries. They are delicious. Service is ok and the place was clean. A little bit more expensive than Mc Donalds and Burguer King but worth it.,Good,Good,Good
"We just wanted to enjoy our lunch in peace, but first had to deal with the 'official' photographer. We were supposed to receive one free commemorative photo for our visit, but he took many more photos ‚Äì and we soon found out why. He tried to get us to buy a handful of photos plus cardboard frames for the exorbitant price of US$30. When we said no, he reduced the price. We said no again, and he kept trying to haggle. Eventually, just to get rid of him, we paid him US$5 for the photos (with no cardboard frames). It certainly left a sour taste in our mouths about this restaurant, and we are unlikely to come back again because of it.",,Bad,
I love their Burgers... It's huge and tasty...Milkshakes are very good....Where ever you see th Jonny Rockets just get in you won't regret it...,Good,Good,
Great restaurant and very 'amercian' for us Kiwis.  Great place - no alcohol - and cheap eats.   Recommend the root beer float and the chicken sandwiches!,Good,Good,
"We were looking for some food and this place was top rated for the area -- its not.  I ate the worst Philly Cheesesteak of my life there.  Mainly fired onions on a dry bun for over $10.  Fries extra.  Fries were cold.  Bathroom a block away, they gave me the wrong code so I couldn't get in.  This was just a bad, expensive experience.  Over $50 for two people, so three dollar signs, server didn't know any English.  No one really to complain to.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I had the classic cheeseburger, fries and vanilla milkshake. Honestly, the vanilla milkshake felt like it was the one from pulp fiction. The meal cost about $20 with taxes and tip but the food and beverages were phenomenal. Way to go!",Good,Good,
"As you walk in there is a sign saying ""please wait to be seated"". I waited for a minute and a customer told me to sit anywhere. I went to the counter to get a menu and was asked straight away what ild like to order. I advised the lady ""that I would a couple of mins to actually look through the menu first"".
Once ordered:
- they gave me the wrong milk shake, however they did change it for the correct one.
- they gave me cold fries and they replaced them with warm ones.
The food was good once they corrected their mistakes. The Oreo milkshake was amazing.",Good,,
"Visited Johnny Rockets twice during our weeks stay, and it was a great place to go for lunch/dinner and even better that it was only across the road from our hotel! Service was fast and friendly and the food was great.",Good,Good,Good
"Decent little stop off at Hollywood and Highland if the kids need a feed.  Burgers and fries were tasty and reasonably priced for the area.


Server was friendly but the lady posted by the door offering to take 'free' photos then taking them whilst you're eating followed by badgering you to buy them also whilst you're eating was a major annoyance!!! 


Visited during Oscars weekend and was rammed but this could could be why.",Good,Bad,Good
"Great value for money, quick and friendly service and delicious burgers! I had the sliders which were great and came with fries.",Good,,Good
"Service was quick but not personal at all. Food was that of burgers, chips, certainly nice but nothing actually healthy. All the same it was a Good just people watching. Price wise, a bit up there for what you got.",Good,Good,
"A slice of classic Americana, in a tasteful retro dinner setting. A nice selection of burgers (with juicy meat and fresh buns), and some pretty awesome shakes.",Good,Good,
"Located in the Hollywood and Highland Centre, we found Johnny Rockets while looking around the centre.  Decided to go in for lunch as we weren't looking for anything heavy or big.  Walked in and was immediately greeted by staff behind the counter, the restaurant was packed with diners, but we managed to get a table.  Loved the 50's/60's theme of the restaurant and the menu.  Hubby had a chili dog, which he really enjoyed, bit messy but he loved it.  Our 16yr old had a bacon and tomato sandwich, which she enjoyed. 
5 star rating is my husband's recommendation.  I would have given it a less score purely because there was a photographer in the restaurant who came to the table asking to take pictures, we let her and then she pushed for us to buy them - yes we could have declined her taking pictures in the first place, but we don't believe that she should have been there, we were there to eat.  I also noticed a dog entered the premises with some young guys carrying skateboards....they were allowed to sit at a table and order food - the guys didn't appear to be disabled, nor did the dog appear to be a service dog - it wasn't wearing anything that would identify that it was...it was a scruffy little white dog that ate food from the floor....the guys let it sit up on the seat at the table....so for those couple of things, I would have scored them lower...even though I enjoyed the atmosphere, and the food.",Good,,Good
50's retro diner with  a variety of milkshakes available plus burgers and fries. Occasionaly the staff burst into song along with what's being played on the jukebox which adds to that 1950s experience,Good,Good,Good
We stopped in for lunch and it did the job. The wait staff were fast and our food was prepared quick.,Good,,Good
We stopped in for lunch. Burger was good and so were the fries. We ate fast because we had a tour to catch. Our waiter did a good job and our orders arrived fast.,Good,,Good
Quite expensive burgers but a real treat . Could not fault the food or the service . Try to avoid busy eating times as there will be a queue (lunchtime and later P.M) but worth a visit,Good,Good,Good
I can definitely recommend the double cheeseburger and the shakes. Good quality and not as greasy as some people describe. But what do you except with juicy beef patties and double cheese. It will drip.,Good,Good,
I love Johnny Rockets and this one in Hollywood is in a great location - you can watch the world go by. The staff and food was amazing.,Good,Good,Good
"The staff seated us as soon as there was an open table.  This location attracts many tourists, so it was expected there would be a wait.  Once seated, we had an attentive server, and our lunch items were delicious.  Even our most finicky eater ate all of his chicken strips!  If you are visiting Hollywood, this is a good place to have a meal.",Good,Good,Good
"Nice retro looking place in good location with ok food. Service was very fast but lacked sincerity and our waiter went though motions a little bit, no doubt to guarantee his tip. Burger was ok but incredibly greasy.  Chips were good. Average experience - no better, no worse. Much better experience at Mel's diner a short walk away.",,,
The kids loved the food.  The burger was delicious along with the amazing onion rings!  Yummy would come back again,Good,Good,
"Popped in here for breakfast with my partner, we were greeted with a warm welcome upon arrival. The food was very nice, the portion sizes were very generous, and it was very good value for money. Will definitely visit again if we are in the area.",Good,Good,Good
Great friendly photographer took nice shots of our family reunion.  The kids meals are popular as well.,Good,Good,
"We went while on a day trip in LA. After seeing the sign and taking lots of photos came here. 
The food is delicious and reasonable on price. Perfect for all ages and catered for our friend who is vegetarian. 
So authentic and good fun. 
Can't wait to come back!",Good,Good,
It has been a couple decades since I was at a Johnny Rockets and now I remember why. Went to grab some food between AFI events. The service was friendly but slow. It looked like they had just gone thru a rush and the dining room looked like it hadn't been attended to. The brownie dessert tasted like it have been cut with an onion knife. My friends dinner came out after mine. It just seemed very unorganized.  The prices were reasonable and again the service was friendly. But overall there are better places to go for a quick bite to eat in Hollywood.,Bad,Bad,
Always like the burgers here - tasty and Dove juicy patties. Host is efficient but not much sincerity and warmth.,Good,,
"This place is a little bit of nostalgia for us Aussies who used to have it back home.  Food was as expected, fries and shakes are the highlights.  50's diner hamburger experience.  Do it if you are new to the states, you will already know a better burger place if you are a repeat visitor.",Good,Good,
Must-do!  Johnny Rockets are awsome. The service are great and its really pleasant. Good for a romantic visit. The Food is great.,Good,Good,Good
There were not many options around and we were desperate. The food was ok but was only as a last resort.,Good,,
It was the only late night place the kids and I could go to. The kids love it but I have to other Johnny Rockets location with better atmosphere.,Good,Good,
"THE best place for milkshake in LA. If you haven't been go, simple as. Grilled chicken burger was lovely. Staff are great and the place is clean.",Good,Good,Good
"Decent selection of breakfast food, well cooked and served quite quickly. Staff are friendly and cheerful, restaurant is clean and has old style charm. Cup of tea was a tea bag still in it's pack, served with a pot of lukewarm water, little pods of creamer and syrup; terrible.",Good,Good,Good
Great american burger and fries. We tried the cheese and bacon fries. Great taste. The service was friendly  from beginning to end.,Good,,Good
"Lovely 10"" hot dogs but did not feel over-full afterwards.  So much so, had room for ice-cream sundaes which were so good, we had them again in San Francisco!",Good,Good,
"Looking for a late-night bite with a classic feel? Johnny Rockets is a good bet that is open until 1 AM on the weekends. I recommend a malted shake and a burger, but there are other excellent options to choose from such as root beer floats and club sandwiches. Finding an open seat my be your biggest challenge as this is a very popular spot.",Good,Good,
Love the old 50's style diner layout of this place. The hot dogs are the tastiest ever! If you like plain then go for the chicken tenders. But the cheese and bacon fries are melt in the mouth! Would recommend the milkshakes for a smooth and delicious cold drink,Good,Good,
"Service was outstanding, food was ready fairly quick despite a full house.
Food was delicious, shakes are well prepared and the Apple Pie is superb.
Would go back any day of the week",Good,Good,Good
Loved the food especially the ice cream floats. The staff was great. Restaurant was clean. Went at lunch time so the line was long but for me well worth it.,Good,Good,Good
"Happy Days style furniture, polite personnel, but the most important thing...delicious burgers! I tried the smoked burger, it was awesome!!
The fries were good too.
One of the best meals I had during my 7 days spell in LA",Good,Good,Good
"This restaurant was okay, but very average food. We had breakfast since we were in the area. Their breakfast menu was very sparse.",,,
"We came on our last night after climbing the Hollywood Sign and were feeling hungry. 
I had a hotdog and cheesy fries and they were lovely. The fries came separate to the meal which was a little disappointing but was still hot when the main arrived. 
The m&m milkshake was delicious too.
Well priced too.",Good,,
"I was looking forward to show my favourite burger shop in LA and was very dissapointed. This was my third and last visit at this place.
Both burgers we ordered were cold on the top, we tasted only mayo and much fat (which was dropping onto our plates) from the whole thing which they call burger. 
Service wasn't good, the guy refilled a cup, left it for couple of minutes at the bar before we got it. I almost stood up to get it myself. He had only 3 tables alltogether, so he really wasn't busy. 
Fries tasted good but we got them 15 minutes before burgers. 
The guy wasn't even asking how was the food, if we were satisfied. This probably because he has seen how our mood changed from friendly/happy to very dissapointed. I couldn't eat the whole burger, but we made it somehow eatable with a very big portion of ketchup. 
We just wanted to pay after this disaster without any big deal and leave the place. 
When we received our invoice with 38$ on it, we decided to give only 2$ of tip due to bad burgers and unfriendly service, what's still too generous. He explicitly asked for the tip and we clearly said to charge only 40. To our surprise he charged over 43$. After we insisted, he charged the tip back and said in a very rude way that we are here in USA and we should pay a proper tip.
I used to like this place, but I won't come here again.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Decided to try this burger joint as heard that it was good . Busy place , full of life and the staff were kept busy . Burger on bun was tasty and so was the blt . A fast food joint which served fresh cooked food . Friendly staff too",Good,Good,Good
"This isn't the place for a romantic dinner for two. However, we came here for a (large) lunch before going to see a movie at the Chinese Theatre.


Our waiter was very pleasant and the food was good and tasty, although our shared fries and onion rings came out of the kitchen about 10 minutes before our burgers, which wasn't ideal. 


We enjoyed it here, and the 50's diner concept was good fun. I would eat here again.",Good,Good,Good
One of the best diner chains I've been. Food is affordable and has a proper American taste on it. Customer service is good and the place looks clean enough. Be ready for a 15 minutes wait after 8pm.,Good,Good,Good
First place to eat after flight from UK. Because of time difference it seemed like 2am to us. The service was great. The burgers and chips were excellent. A very good start to an American vacation. It is in a centre where it feels very safe.,Good,Good,Good
"Went here after a party for some food. There is a guy who walks around to taking photos and pressures you to take a photo so you can get a ""complimentary"" photo postcard. He wouldn't take no for an answer when he tried to sell them to us. I had to practically yell at him....and then he took the postcard away lol. I had a blt and just when I was finishing the sandwich I noticed a HUGE rot spot on my tomato. Poor wait stuff on top of it. Skip it.",Bad,Bad,Bad
We came here as everyone says how amazing it is. My first bite of the burger was real tasty and juicy I was enjoying it but it went cold really quickly and then it didn't taste so great. Probs won't try it again. Had better burgers.,,,
Had the best shake of my life here. I can't stop raving about it. The burgers and fries were ok... but those shakes!,Good,,
Johnny Rockets never fails to disappoint. The smokehouse burger is super tasty and the bacon cheese fries are really to die for - I've been unable to find bacon cheese fries like this elsewhere. Food came quickly and service was good.,Good,Good,Good
"very popular restaurant, very friendly staff catered for our needs no problems.  food was great and topups on all drinks more than once",Good,Good,Good
The best shakes ever depends on what you get food is great nice retro theme. Private jukebox and get photos taken,Good,Good,
"When you walk into this fine restaurant be prepared to step into the 1960s.  The food, the atmosphere and the juke box make this a must!",Good,Good,
"went with my girl friend and we both had the tastiest burgers ever... quite expensive but I guess it was expeted ,shakes were gorgeous too",Good,,
"Visited Jonny Rockets and restaurant was very dated very costly and very poor.  First we ordered chicken bites and they were raw in the middle and my wife had half eaten one.  My order was the burger which came on soggy fat filled bread.  When I complained it was as if they heard it lots of times before, so I can only say this was is best to be missed and I will call environmental health department as the manager did not seem concerned at all.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Expensive, but this you expect. Burgers really meaty and nice. Club chickensalad overpriced and just nothing special. Staff very friendly. Great 50's feel which I love.",Good,Good,Good
"You can always rely on Johnny Rockets for great milkshakes and this branch didn't let us down.


Food was good. Service not so good.


Usually the milkshakes get brought out quite quickly.  It was disappointing that we had to keep asking for our drinks even after our food arrived.",Good,,Bad
"We had lunch at Johnny Rockets and the kids ate again at Knots Berry Farm.  It was a good place to sit and relax.  It's fairly crowded but we got lucky and got a table quickly.  Compared to the other places we ate in LA, I'd recommend it.",,Good,
"I was very disappointed with my experience at this particular Johnny Rockets.  Not sure what prices are like elsewhere, but I felt this was overpriced for what we got.  Over $10 for a burger that was not that sizable, and was lacking in flavor.  I got the Houston Burger which sounded like it should have had a lot of flavor, but not really.  The burger was small, and didn't even come with fries.  Not impressed at all.


The restaurant itself was small and seemingly understaffed.  Our waiter was good and did his best.",Bad,Bad,Good
"Coming here, thought there burgers would be really good. But was very disappointed. On the other hand their shakes and chili cheese fries were good",,,
i really liked Johnny rockets ...it has superior quality than other fast food chain that provide the same kind of hamburghers..also the service is much better,Good,,Good
"The place was surpisingly the first place we ate at in America and was the best of the 3 weeks (50+ meals) we stayed in the US. The Best was the shakes. This was recommended by our waiter and it did not disappoint. Our second meal (second day) came out wrong and when the waiter check his order book and agreed, was very happy to correct his mistake! They were busy at the time.",Good,Good,Good
This is something you can try.  It is worth the value for money.  Retro setting - causal dining.  Service is not too bad if you get a good server.,Good,Good,
My favorite burger place for the last 5 to 6 years...during my all visits to USA i make sure that i visit Johnny rockets atleast  once ...my favorite bring the chocolate shake and my all time favourite burger the 12th man....and heard the story abt the name from one of the waitress as well...very juicy and tasty burgers i ever had..with Apple wood smoked bacon on.top...makes ur day,Good,Good,Good
It was our first time in Johnny Rockets. We ate here before we went to see a movie at the chinese theatre. It is in a quieter area of the hollywood and highland centre.It was a very cosy american diner. The food arrived quickly and was very good. They have a photographer who comes up and takes photos of you if you want and you can pay for a bigger photo if you want but he offers a free photo anyway.,Good,Good,Good
"We enjoyed dinner here, our waitress was really helpful.  The food was good enough and the atmosphere was pretty cool.  Our waitress even gave us a drink refill to go which was great since it was still quite warm outside.",Good,Good,Good
"Burgers n fries, with a few others thrown in for good measure.
Traditional diner layout inside with good rock n roll playing in the background.",Good,Good,
"This is one of the best places to get a classic burger and fries combination. Of course, the malts are outstanding! I enjoy the fun, yet laid back atmosphere of the restaurant.",Good,Good,
The burgers were tasty but not exceptional.  Rather expensive for what we got.  The drinks were very cold that was a plus.  A free photo postcard was taken by the onsite photographer as a souvenir a nice thought.,,Good,
"We were exploring Hollywood Boulevard and needed some dinner came across this diner in the shopping complex we are burger fans and must say we enjoyed the burgers, onion rings and fries but the best part of the meal was our shake chocolate peanut butter milk shake not a combination I thought we would even try but glad we did, it was awesome! Being a 50's style American burger diner makes the experience all the better.",Good,Good,
Was wondering around the Blvd and was starving. Found this place in the mall. Was kind of weird to pay extra for a side of fries. $9 for a cheeseburger and $4 for fries seems kind of steep. Good quality food though.,Good,,
Have to pay extra for fries and sides. Expensive for what you get. Better options in LA. Food wasn't bad just not good. Disappointed,Bad,,
Good place to eat and this was where I had my first Johnny Rockets meal. Love the burgers and the milk shake. The parking in this area is not very good since it is in the strip and there is a lot of traffic. If you live in the area or are walking in this area then I would recommend without hesitation. If you are driving directly to this location then I would advise going when there is less traffic since finding a place to park was a pain. Overall good place to eat and if parking was better it would be 5 stars.,Good,,
"We found this caf√© while we were just wandering around the shops. The style and d√©cor is what drew us in. It is decked out in the traditional style of the 50's/60's with the red booths and diner style bar stools. Mini juke boxes are on the tables, the staff are dressed in the old style wait staff uniform, there's old fashioned music playing, a truly authentic atmosphere. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive, the menu consists of hamburgers, fries, sodas and shakes and we were happy with what we ordered. As an Aussie it was a great taste of America from the 50's.",Good,Good,Good
We ate here after we walked around the Hollywood walk of fame. The food was very good. We got the tuna sandwich and fries. And our son got a burger. Service was excellent and they even have a photographer who takes your photo for free. But we tipped her anyway. This eating spot is in a perfect location to everything.,Good,Good,Good
"I am a health nut, but when I'm ready to cheat, I go hard! Johnny Rockets is my ""go-hard"" place. I went to the one in Hollywood while travelling on business. I was my first visit to Hollywood, and I was ready to dive in the minute I saw the logo.


I believe I had the Smokehouse Burger with onion rings. Yeah, that sounds like me. Whenever I hear the word ""smokehouse"" I loose it. It is all that you would expect from a burger. Smokey, juicy, tasty, etc. I was altogether a great bacon cheeseburger.


I love the design and decor of the interior. The chairs, the uniforms, the booths all had that 1950's feel. The one I went to even had a juke box on the tables.


It was a great experience.",Good,Good,
"Long arrow facility makes it feel crowded as patrons and staff squeezes by tables. In a shooing center right off Hollywood Blvd, it draws a mealtime crowd. Better alternates nearby.",,Bad,
Stopped by to have a quick breakfast and the food was good. Would have been 5 star but they had no advocado to add to my BELT sandwich :( very American styled breakfast. Enjoyed it nevertheless wasn't too heavy on the stomach for breakfast :),Good,,
"Johnny Rocket's is a classic little fast food place with yummy food and lots of charm. They serve shakes, burgers, sandwiches, etc. My friends and I loved it!",Good,Good,
"Popped in Johnny Rockets to sample a Diner experience & it didn't disappoint. A little on the expensive side, the calorie laden food was very tasty & certainly filled a hole. Drinks were constantly replenished by our lovely hostess (who kept saying ""Awesome""). No toilet facilities though so hard to wash your hands before eating.",Good,Bad,Good
"Everything was great here as expected.  The milkshake was amazing and brought all the boys to the yard.  My burger oozed with gooey, greasy, bacon goodness, and my tater tots, boasted with cheese, bacon bits,and sour cream!  What could possibly go wrong with this meal??? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!   my plates and shake were the envy of all those that passed by and stared.  GO.... GET... YOU... SOME!",Good,Good,
"We wanted to try original American hamburgers, and this place felt like a movie from the past, very nice atmospere, tasty hamburgers. I would have liked to get more information about options, presented in meny preferebly with pictures.",Good,Good,
"I'm not a big hamburger person so this is a turn up for the books, I had a smokehouse burger so yummy and a vanilla shake.
This place has great atmosphere, the old 50's milk bar look",Good,Good,
We went twice whilst in Hollywood for a few days day. We found it by accident looking for a place to eat and it was one of the best burgers and shakes I've had. Went back again fore a delicious shake.the next day. Reminds of the place in Back to the Future. For an Aussie the price (exchange rate) meant it was pricey but what a burger.,Good,Good,
"This looks like an old time Malt Shoppe. We had a breakfast sandwich and Everything Eggs. Portions were big, my eggs easily enough for two people. Good coffee. I will look for Johnny Rockets in the future.",Good,Good,
What can I say..... I loved it! I couldn't believe how fast they served us. Rocket Double for 6 girls....delicious!!!!! The best part was taking our pictures with the milkshakes #classic #remind me to come back to this spot!,Good,Good,Good
The staff are great here the food's great too but the decor is awesome i had been to one along time ago with my dad and loved it as it took him back to his younger days was great to experience it again.,Good,Good,Good
"It was our first night in LA so we don't remember much but this place was open late (about 10.30pm) and it was busy.  We got lots of food, very fast!  Typical burgers & fries, great milkshakes, waiters dressed in 50's style clothes, jukebox was playing, diner style decor, reasonable staff, very attentive waiter.",Good,Good,Good
For me this is classic American style hamburger. Nice interior in 50's to 60's style. Worth to visit!,,Good,
"Stopped in here for lunch during a conference. The decor is very homey; felt like an episode of Happy Days. The staff are welcoming and attentive. Their system for filling orders is on point, very efficient.
I like that the prep area is right behind the bar so you can watch your food being made.
I ordered the chicken burger since I can't eat red meat. The beef burgers looked and smelled amazing though!
The chicken burger was average tasting and nice portion. I was surprised it did not come with any side. No fries, no onion rings, nada.
All in all a simple, decent quality lunch experience.",Good,Good,Good
"We had our picture taken while we were there, but there was no pressure to buy it.  It got a little crowded but not over the top.",,Good,
"Rocket Double, side of fries and onion rings with a Vanilla shake. 
EEMENSE!
Probably the best burger fries rings and shake ever. A little pricey but in a great location in the Highland Centre and no one should ever quibble at paying for quality grub. 
Would definitely go back again.",Good,Good,
Same food as the chains but no singing waiters or staff. Service was slow and food was wrong at first. Would have done better at In and Out burger,,,Bad
"Stopped here while looking around Hollywood. Great place that is nostalgic of '50's malt shops, AND has great products.  We had hand-made shakes that were great and we watched them prepare burgers in front of us that were mouth-watering - unfortunately we had already eaten but were tempted to eat again.",Good,Good,
"This was our first time dining at traditional American fast food shop. The burgers were delicious, the services was excellence and the price was reasonable.",Good,,Good
"Popped in as thought we would get an authentic American burger lunch.


Sat at the counter and the service was dire. Despite sitting under the staff's noses they forgot about us. Forgot to take our order. Lost our order, Forgot our milkshakes, forgot our milkshakes again.


Sadly a poor experience and when we said we weren't impressed with the service the staff looked blank.",,Bad,Bad
Great hamburgers and the service was quick with your food. They are very friendly. Also they take your photos: one is free and four are $20.,Good,Good,Good
"I had read the reviews and wanted to try the hamburgers...we were not disappointed! The hamburgers here are delicious, the best I've ever tasted (even our fussy kids agreed!) Service was excellent and prompt. Highly recommended.",Good,Good,Good
Great hamburgers and loved the ice cream floats. The food portions were more than I expected but I still ate it all üòù it was great.,Good,,
Average breakfast with an above average price. Service was ok. I found the restaurant lacking in cleanliness. Portions were good.,Good,Bad,Good
"Food was awesome, service was quick and it wasn't crowded at all so easy to walk in and grab a booth. Highly recommended for lunch if you're in the area",Good,Good,Good
We ate lunch here and had excellent service and Good.  Very convenient to all shopping and places of interest.,Good,Good,Good
"Really Good, yummy milk shakes, decent food and a great little dance number by the staff. Overall a great little find for lunch.",Good,Good,Good
Wow just amazing food I couldn't believe how delicious my burger was we went back again on our second to last night!! The service here is excellent and your in and out within a short time which was exactly what we needed as we were tired!! Perfect location! Will look forward to having another Johnny Rockets next time we travel.,Good,Good,Good
"I can't imagine visiting USA without eating at Jonny Rockets. This America  style dinner has amazing food, I had Philliy steak and cheese sandwich with chilli cheesey fries. The have a refillable drink too.",Good,,
Loved to meet with friends and clients there for lunch. Great burgers and great service. It is always a great experience and like a little time travel to the past.,Good,Good,Good
"Food was really good, especially the shakes. As well as as our server whom was accurate with our orders and did the smiley ketchup bowl.  I don't know if it was the spring break rush, but the place was not as clean as it should have been.  Floor was sticky and we could see greasy palm prints in the walls and glass.  I'm not extremely picky but this made me a bit uncomfortable.",Good,Bad,Good
"Quaint little 50s style burger joint. Nice and clean, reasonable prices, friendly wait staff. The smiling sauce bowl was a cute touch.",Good,Good,Good
"We popped in here for a bite to eat whilst in Hollywood for the day and it was one of the best burgers I've had. Cooked freshly in front of you in the open kitchen, really friendly staff and a all round good diner experience. We would recommend... you even get a ketchup smiley face served with your fries!",Good,Good,Good
"It is one I had heard of on TV in the UK, and was in the mood for a burger, but did NOT want to go to MCdonalds etc. Plus, they also have sweet potato fries, which I really prefer to regular. 
The service was excellent, friendly, but not too in your face, nor too rushed.
It IS a burger bar, so, don't go in expecting gourmet food or anything, and it is fine, for what it is. Not minblowingly best burgers or anything, but fine. 
A million miles better than McDs etc.",Good,Good,Good
We went here because all others didn't look too appetizing. The restaurant looks like a 50's diner. The ambience is awesome. The waitstaff are Awesome!! The order of Fries is HUGE!! very shareable!,Good,Good,Good
Had the pulled pork fries. Was a large portion size but nothing special. Around the corner is a nice spot to sit and eat overlooking Hollywood Boulevard.,Good,Good,
"This is kind of a fun place to eat. It is a chain of retro 50s looking diners outfitted with red vinyl seats, and jukebox stations. 


My wife and I just wanted something light for lunch so we each split the Onion Rings (made with sourdough) accompanied with Ranch Dressing and Chili Cheese Fries topped with chili, cheddar cheese and chopped onions. All arrived fairly quickly in baskets. Onion Rings were good although it's kind of hard to mess up onion rings. The Chili Cheese Fries were very good with a nice chili and cheese mix. The best part were the milkshakes. They were made the old fashioned way served in a fairly large glass and reserve in a metal container and each covered with a whipped topping. I had the Butterfinger shake while my wife had the Vanilla shake which she said was good. The Butterfinger was good and thick although a bit mild in flavour.


The place was very clean, and fun looking and we had a very bubbly server.",Good,Good,Good
We only ordered burgers and beers.  The meat was cooked to perfection and the service was exceptional!  A bit pricey but worth it!!!,Good,,Good
"Very clean, staff happy, polite and keen to engage with the diner/s.
Excellent value for money and a great place to take the family.  Good vibe.  Memories of Happy Days.",Good,Good,Good
"I do not usually dine alone, but was waiting for my son to get off work. I decided to sit at the counter at Johnny Rockets, and I am glad I did. The staff is great and very friendly. The food was good, not great, but very good.",Good,,Good
"The food is really good. The burgers are really tasty, but I really loved the milkshakes especially the oreo one.",Good,,
"Had Good, fun atmosphere, Good (with a lot of smiles), came back to check on us often for satisfaction, refills, etc. Well managed place in a popular location.",Good,Good,Good
"We ate here one evening because we were staying nearby. Located at the Hollywood and Highland Center, Jonnie Rockets is a retro American diner chain. Surprisingly, the food was incredibly tasty and well priced. Our waiter was friendly and made recommendations from the menu. Service was always with a smile. I ate a delicious hot dog and sweet chilli fries, my husband ate a burger and we both enjoyed different versions of Oreo shakes. I will definitely revisit when we head back to LA.",Good,Good,Good
"Got that old school diner feel about it. We went in early afternoon and was not very busy which meant our food came out really quick. The burger was amazing! Could not find a single fault with it. Was a little bit pricey for a burger and fries, restrooms were a bit of a walk away from the restaurant.",Good,Good,Good
"For a quick meal while you do the tourist thing, this is a fun place to eat.  My burger was very good and the service was quick while the place was packed.",Good,Good,Good
The food was really good here. Great service our waitress was very helpful. Love the added smiley face of sauce its cute. The food was really really good. We did not wait long at all and it was very busy. The waitress was constantly topping up our refillable drinks didn't have to ask once. The peanut butter milkshake was amazing!!,Good,,Good
"Needed to eat between tours. Great service, food, & atmosphere. Only negative, felt like they wanted us out after we ate. Felt rushed. We wanted to check out info in stores in area. We left and sat by escalators.",Good,Good,Good
"I have been to a few Johnny Rockets in the US, and they have always been good. Love the burgers and shakes.",Good,,
"Great to experience the 50's.  From food to the uniforms, this was a walk back in time.  Generous serves and well presented.",Good,Good,Good
"We have heard so much about this retro place so we decided to try it out for ourselves. We had their original American Burgers with Chips. I had a burger with egg and hubby had burger with bacon &.eggs. Both were delicious and the chips were crunchy. The place was clean, the staff were very friendly and attentive. The only draw back with this place is that they have all these little juke box machines on the tables but they don't work. They were only for decorations! That was a bit disappointing as we were looking forward to putting some quarters in it to play some 50s or 60s music. Maybe they could get some juke boxes that actually work & that will live up the place a bit !",Good,Good,Good
Great Diner to take the whole family. Awesome food and 1950's nostalgia. Chili Cheese Fries and a Cherry Coke! Pretty sure we saw Johnny Depp in the corner booth!,Good,Good,
"I love Johnny rockets, even though the burger competition in California is insane specially with in n out and umami, and all these other great burger places, Johnny Rockets still stands strong, at least in my opinion.",Good,,
"I just can't be in LA without their salted caramel shake! 
This place is usually very busy but staff is still service minded and polite. I always come back for their ketchup made smiley faces, their smiles and not to mention the food!",Good,Good,Good
"Good burgers, the meat is perfectly cooked, you have to ask for a medium rare, but then they do it very well. Excellent onion rings. The bun is not at the same level. The apple pie if fantastic!",Good,,
This place is amazing. Great food including the old fashion Hot Dog and Burger with all the trimmings. The staff are vibrant and cheerful and you always leave feeling full and refreshed.,Good,Good,Good
Spent time here on our Rose Bowl trip.  Bartender and manager were super fun and friendly.  Only had appetizers but they were all good! Recommend as a place for a few drinks.,Good,Good,Good
Went to Johnny Rockets to experience the retro diner. Quite touristy but otherwise very nice. Staff were friendly and prompt. Burgers came quickly and were nice. Very fond of the onion rings,Good,Good,Good
We had a hamburger and fries and splurged by adding a chocolate milk shake -- it was all yummy!  Service was great too!  Very friendly and helpful.,Good,,Good
This place is amazing. I look for this chain every time I travel the States! Great food including the old fashion Hot Dog and Burger with all the trimmings. The staff are vibrant and cheerful and you always leave feeling full and refreshed.,Good,Good,Good
"Our first trip to LA and while looking around for a good place to have lunch, just decided to try the original American burgers.  Kind of interesting to see the retro dinner d√©cor inside.  Staff were pretty friendly and gave us good recommendations of what to order.",,Good,Good
"I had a coupon for a free birthday burger and showed up at this location to use it.  The manager said that he typically doesn't honour these coupons, but he was willing to make an exception in this case.  He was so welcoming and accommodating, it set the whole tone of our visit.


The burgers were among the best we've had and he even drew happy faces with the ketchup for us.  OK, maybe we're overgrown kids, but I thought it was really cool.  Fantastic milkshakes too.",Good,Good,Good
"In need of a burger we visited Johnny Rockets but were ultimately disappointed. The burgers we OK but no more than that and although the service was reasonable quick and friendly, nothing really stood out to encourage us to re-visit - so we didn't.",,,
We were staying in the Loews hotel round the corner and ate breakfast here everyday for 5 days. Lovely friendly staff. Variety on the menu.Even came back for lunch one day.,Good,Good,Good
"We stopped in for some milkshakes and they were lovely, as were the onion rings, which were a really big portion. The service was good and friendly.The only downside was the guy taking photos and offering a free one,( obviously we knew he was going to try and sell us some and acually were quite pleased to have some pictures of us together), but after printing off six photos of you you are then made to feel guilty for not buying them which is just a bit uncomfortable (could be a British thing!). Like I said we brought them because we liked them but I think it is a bit unnessecary to do that when you are there to eat.",Good,Bad,Good
"Weather you actually remember it or just want to experience it, Johnny Rockets is a great place to eat. The shakes are the best ever that just top off a great meal. You can even get your picture taken. The location is also great in Hollywood.",Good,Good,
"Quite simply the dirtiest food establishment I have visited in a long time, service was poor, food was terrible. Something to be avoided.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"After a gruelling flight from Australia, we checked into our hotel and set off to explore Hollywood Blvd. We were hot and tired by dinner time and saw Johnny Rockets in the Hollywood and Highland complex. We had a Johnny Rockets in Perth, Australia, many years ago and we were keen to try it our again with our sons, 15 and 13. 
We ordered the usual fare, burgers and chicken strips and my husband ordered the chilli fries, which came out smothered in a thick sauce. Well, we ate everything, the burgers were nice and only my husband ate the chilli fries. He mentioned they tasted fatty and ended up eating only three quarters of the serving. We went back to our hotel tired and ready for bed. 
My husband woke up at about 3am pacing the room with an upset stomach. He ended up spending the whole night in the bathroom, vomiting up the fatty chilli fries until there was nothing left.
We had plans for our first full day in LA but sadly, my husband spent the day in bed and in the bathroom while I had to take the boys out. He lost a whole day because of those fries, and we went back to Johnny Rockets to tell the manager. We did not want anything, no free food or vouchers, just to let him know he better check the freshness of his chilli sauce so no other customers experience what my husband went through. He hung his head and pretended to be interested, but really, he could not care less.
We left the restaurant feeling frustrated and very disappointed. We will never set foot in a Johnny Rockets restaurant ever again.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We went in for some fries and a shake in the afternoon and had to wait 15mins for a table even though there were plenty of spare tables as they wanted to give us a large booth were we were happy to take 2 small booths. I didn't like that you were instantly hassled by a photographer to get souvenir photos. We just wanted a snack not a photo.


Our waiter was attentive and refilled our drinks quickly. The shakes and fries were good.",Good,Bad,Good
"Just wanted an afternoon snack, chilli was really runny, hardly any cheese and staff seemed preoccupied.  Restaurant was nearly empty which has never been the case on previous visits.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I like the service and food here, same as other locations but I think service is little better because even they were busy, the waitress is still attentive. The shake is delicious and hamburger is hot(fresh served).",Good,,Good
Never again. Under cooked chips. Staff arguing in front of customers. Food waste and plates piled next to us whilst still eating and then the cheek to ask for a tip!,Bad,,Bad
"Good and value for money with plenty of choice in small restaurant, meals come with a free photo, although they do try to sell you more",Good,,
"The place was nicely decorated with red booth/counter seats and the staffs were dressed in cute uniforms. We ordered The Original and a Route 66 which were very good. The chocolate milkshake was delicious. 


There was a mini jukebox on the table but it wasn't working. Not sure if it's for decorative purpose only. 


There was also a photographer who told us he could take a free photo for us but he came back with 4 photos and he gave us the option to pay for the 3. Otherwise, the free photo was a small one. We felt kind of obliged so the feeling wasn't great. 


Otherwise, this is a great place for burgers and milkshake.",Good,Good,Good
"Great memorabilia and atmosphere in this cute little restaurant. Service excellent...Friendly,  smiling wait staff. Food was good. Shakes were fabulous.",Good,Good,Good
"With only a short time to grab something quick to eat, I chose Johnny Rockets as it looked like a fun place and not much they could do wrong with a burger and fries. How wrong could I be? Fries arrived five minutes before my burger so were cold. The delay to the arrival of my double burger was due to its cremation and two burnt discs in a stodgy bun was what came. Couldn't understand what was the purpose of the waitress who was running around taking pictures of fellow diners. It was hardly the experience of a lifetime!! Had better burgers in a roadside diner.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We have very fond memories of the famous ‚Äòno-one can beat‚Äô original American hamburgers and Johnny Rockets is an all time favourite of ours. This restaurant has a 1950s diner feel to it, complete with black and white checkered floors and neon signs. 
We were thrilled to find a Johnny Rockets in Hollywood and were shown to our seats by our waiter, William. Unfortunately, the jukebox at our booth was broken, so we couldn‚Äôt play the girls a few of our favourite songs. Our order was ready before we‚Äôd had time to blink, but I don‚Äôt remember Johnny Rockets burgers being this bad. The fries, patties and burger buns were burnt, and the lettuce and tomatoes were wilted ‚Äì definitely not how I remember it! The atmosphere was still amazing though, and the waiters and waitresses gave the diners a singing and dancing show every hour. Reviewed by MrsHospitality",Bad,Good,Good
My friend and I were trying to find a place to get breakfast that was affordable and this was the place we came to.  The drinks are pricey but the actual breakfast was ok.  It was the only place we could find that was open that we could find that served breakfast.  So if you want a traditional breakfast instead of eating at your hotel this is the place you should come to.,Good,,
Unique place to relax and grab a bite.  The burgers are good along with the rest of the items on the menu.  Johnny Rockets is a very short distance off Hollywood Blvd.,Good,Good,
"Johnny Rockets is always fun, and the food is always tasty. The staff here is also used to lots of tourists, and to their credit, they are very accommodating with things like snapping pix of the guests and posing with them. Can be a busy place at peak times. Good prices.",Good,,Good
"good theme burger place, nice atmosphere, loved it but thought burgers would be bigger, but very nice, Good nice music",Good,Good,Good
The restaurant and staff were very friendly and happy to take pictures. We both had burger and shakes. There was a generous portion of both. Then a mam with a camera came round the tables and offered to take a free picture on the souvenir photos.,Good,Good,Good
"My best friend and I went here for a late lunch after exploring Hollywood and we loved the food! 


We had a cheeseburger with a side of Chilli cheese fries to share. The cheeseburger was amazing! Exactly what we wanted! 
The Chilli cheesefries were also amazing! We didn't want it to end! 


The staff were so very friendly and helpful, they were checking on us making sure we were happy or if we wanted a refill (free refill!). 


Writing this review makes me want to back now and get another cheeseburger! YUM!",Good,Good,Good
"Part of the Hollywood and Highland development Johnny Rockets is a throw back to a more innocent and greasy time.  Great service, very clean dining room and the food is what youd expect from a 50's diner only it costs 4 x's what it did in the 50's of course.",Good,Good,Good
"We stopped by here in the morning for some breakfast, lets put it this way the portions were big enough to keep us going right until the evening, after a long day of site-seeing.",Good,,
"The Service: Our server, Matthew, is super sweet. Very attentive and friendly. Checked on us a few times. We sat at the bar and saw all the staffs are working hard and very efficiently.


It is a very busy location because it is located at Hollywood & Highland Center on the 2nd floor. 


The Food: 


Vanilla Milkshake - LOVE LOVE LOVE, real ice-cream and milk. Besides the milkshake glass they serve, they also give you any leftover. So it is about 1.5 glasses of milkshake!


Original Burger - Love it when they toast the buns on the grill. Good size of the beef patty. Fresh meat, not frozen. 


The Parking: 2 hours for $2 with restaurant validation",Good,,Good
Just lucked onto this diner but it was great! Really enjoyed the theming throughout the restaurant and staff too and food was great. Felt like I was right back in the 50s!,Good,Good,Good
"When I can go out to eat at a regular restaurant and it be cheaper I have to wonder why a burger joint is more expensive.  I realized that you are spending almost $3 per drink and then the fries are a separate charge, so for 3 of us to eat was almost $40 and milkshakes were not purchased.  Not complaining about the food or service because it was great, but the pricing was a little too much.",,,Good
Great location and great food.  If you want a meal or a snack this is a wonderful place to eat.   The staff is friendly and accommodating. The menu has many things to choose from but I highly recommend a strawberry milkshake. Very Yummy!   The only down side would be that it's pretty small and in the height of the tourist season you might have a wait.  BUT-it's worth it!!,Good,Good,Good
"Love the hamburguers, the french fries and shakes!!! Good prices and services. If you want to eat something yummy while you are in Highland Mall in Hollywood, you have to visit Johnny Rockets.",Good,Good,Good
"It was a very warm Thursday evening in August when we went for a walk up and down Hollywood Blvd.  At about 9:30 or 10 pm, while in the mall looking for a place for a snack, we came across Johnny Rockets.  We were promptly greeted, asked to find our own seat, then were provided menus.   The choices are what you would expect at a diner;  burgers, sodas, shakes, etc.  The food came in due time and was prepared well and tasted good.",Good,,Good
"We stopped by for a quick snack of regular hamburger, hot dog and sweet potato fries.  The hamburger was freshly cooked and the condiments were fresh and delicious.  The sweet potato fries were hot and not greasy.  Service was friendly and attentive.",Good,,Good
"Stopped in for a quick bite & the hamburger, was cooked just right in a timely fashion.  The staff were friendly, quick & the price was right.  You can't go wrong with Johnny Rockets.",Good,Good,Good
"After walking up n down hollywood boulevard n failing to find somewhere quick to eat we decided to go here. However what we got was very overpriced and substandard food, the fries were cold, there was more ice in my drink than Pepsi and the chicken strips has more crusty outside than chicken in them. Cost $35 for 2 drinks, a burger, chicken strips and fries, literally felt like daylight robbery.",Bad,Bad,
"We really liked this burger spot with my family, you'll get your moneys worth for sure! Huge variety on the menu!",Good,Good,
Great old time american diner experience from the food through to the way the wait staff are dressed to the dance act the staff perform. Felt like I was back in the 50s.,Good,Good,Good
"Best milkshake i've ever had in my life. Was taken there by a LA local friend who recommended we go there and he was right best milkshake ever. Only thing that drags down my rating is that there was a guy in the restaurant who told us it was free to take our photo and we didn't really want to do it but he talked us into it because it was free so that was whatever then he comes back with them all printed trying to sell them to us and we kept saying no, we didn't need them. he'd go away then come back with a cheaper price and we just didn't need a copy of a photo we didn't want or like! he kept badgering until he just gave it to us for free even though we didn't want it! that really just annoyed me because we were trying to enjoy our milkshake and hanging out with a friend but had this guy constantly annoying and interrupting us! real turn off to return.",Good,Bad,
This place has the best burgers I have ever eaten. While sitting in the restaurant you feel like you are a part of a movie from 50's. Really nice.,Good,Good,
"The atmosphere here is nice, service is good, but burgers are over priced and nothing special. We've been disappointed at Johnny Rocket's restaurants elsewhere, but tried them again...and were again disappointed. As to the ""50s diner atmosphere""  they try.",Bad,Good,Good
Happened to drop in for a quick bite for lunch.The burgers are the tastiest we've had. Go on an empty stomach as portions are very generous so recommend sharing fries.,Good,,
Went to JR in Hollywood at the Highland centre. Pretty good burgers and nice concept you can build your own burger from scratch. Would come back again,Good,Good,
"We were shown to a table and served quickly.  The food was excellent and I really enjoyed my salted caramel milkshake.
We could have done without the photographer interrupting to take photos and then sell us them.",Good,Bad,Good
"Went to Johnny rockets at universal studios.
Food was pricey and the best I can say was it was ok.
The only stand out item was the milk shakes which the kids loved.
If it's a burger your after Save your money and go somewhere like Wendy's.",,,
"The food here was usual burger fare, with shakes being the highlight. Service was prompt and friendly. Overall, would return if wanting quick and easy burgers.",Good,Good,Good
"Came here for our first proper American-Diner style burger, the staff were absolutely great, very up-beat and accommodating, the fries were cooked perfectly and came out fast! The burger was exactly how the waiter described it. Free refills on fountain drinks is always a plus!",Good,,Good
The American Diner atmosphere at Johnny Rockets sets it apart. Love the extensive selection of Milkshakes. Burgers taste good. Prices on the high side.,Good,Good,
"Reliably good burgers and patty melt.  Fries were generous, onion rings very good. A large gathering of noisy badly behaved extended family, ( adults as well as children) ruined our meal one evening. I felt bad for the waitress. Our other visits were fine.",Good,Bad,
"Our first American 60's styled restaurant 
Absolutely beautiful truly feels like your in the 60's
Great service 
Amazing food 
Huge portions 
Milkshakes are to die for 
Cool thing is you get your ketchup in a plates done in a design 
So cool",Good,Good,Good
Loved the diner look and feel. Excellent food and service. The burger was one of the best I have eaten!,Good,Good,Good
"Having eaten at a few Johnny Rocket restaurants, I was disappointed at the lack of atmosphere at this particular restaurant. It lacked the old style rock and roll. There was no music to be heard and although the decor was setup in the 50's style, it seemed a little dirty and dark inside. This was a lack of spark from the staff.


The food was ordinary as well. There was a lack of freshness it seemed. The fries were a little stale.",Bad,Bad,Bad
The burger alone is not the deal . try the real Johnny Rockets burgers to enjoy. Don't go if you're on a diet as you need to pick the most patty burger coupled with french fries & a soda......,Good,,
Couldn't believe a Johnny Rockets next to my Hotel I have been looking high and Low for it ..Yes I could of Googled it but the Treat  of finding one ..The Burgers and Milkshakes are 1950's era quality Taste smells and The Vision Heaven,Good,Good,
"This place is really a pleasant surprise as a lunch stop in LA. You get a really quick service by the staff and for the food.
The ambiance is nostalgic with reminisces of the typical 1950's dining set up and service. The burgers where very big and tasty, sweet fries where also very good and he bill was more than reasonable compared to some of the other options we'd tried in the area. We love the milkshakes ... thick, creamy and full of ice cream served in the 50's style glass
I really recommend this place for am affordable quality meal.",Good,Good,Good
I love gaining weight at this place.  Fresh burgers and delicious shakes.  When you can't find anything your child likes you can never go wrong with Johnny Rockets.,Good,Good,
"Ran into a problem the other night with our burger - came out 30 minutes later and it was stone cold. The manager fixed it and had a new out to us in 3 minutes. It was delicious!!!! 
Have tried Johnny rockets all over the US - love this place! Just need to serve a hot burger Everytime!",Good,Good,Good
"Great fresh burgers, nice clean & friendly staff.
Great location upstairs in the Hollywood & Highland Centre",Good,Good,Good
"went there twice as we enjoyed our firts visit. The have plenty variet but no Aussie burgers , next time i will bring thr beetroot",Good,Good,
"I loved this diner. Tucked away in a little corner, though still doing rocking business. The milkshakes are the best I've ever had, and I went back a couple of times just for that. The service was great a the food was yummy. Definitely recommend this place for the milkshakes alone",Good,Good,Good
We enjoyed having breakfast here while staying close by in the Loews hotel. Food was great. Only other comment to make is that the waiter made a big point of circling the suggested tip amount and telling us he had done so for our convenience! I know that tipping is normal in the US but I thought that was a bit pushy!!,Good,,Bad
"Very tasty hamburgers and bottomless soft drinks. Can't ask for more than that! They could, however, use some wi-fi there.",Good,,
"She was pretty, and helpful, but a bit towards the foghorn end of the audio spectrum.  Food was simple, reasonably priced, good choice, good quality.",Good,,Good
"Old style diner, great food, great service, prices reasonable.  Inside hollywood and highland centre so handy for hollywood area.",Good,Good,Good
Arrived in La and really felt like a great American burger and wasn't disappointed. Awesome burger and onion rings. Service was fantastic.,Good,,Good
"The hamburgers were delicious and the drinks were great too - fries were the best part though, as they were amazingly crisp.",Good,,
"Apparently full of wannabes waiting to be discovered.
Its a burger joint at the end of the day - a decent enough one but not worth going out of your way for.",,,
2nd time we have been to a Johnny Rockets in the USA - cannot fault the service or food milk shakes are amazing so too are the burgers - could do with more attentive waiting staff some where on a break eating they were causing lots of fuss and noise with working staff.,Good,,Bad
Thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast at this diner.  So we decided to also eat there for dinner and breakfast the next day.  Really friendly and efficient staff.  Good value. Our family group enjoyed the fun and casual feel.,Good,Good,Good
The hamburbers were delicious and we got free refills for our sodas.  The outfit of the staff reminds me of the 50's movies.  There was even someone who took our pictures and gave out a free sample picture.  We ordered 2 big copies for posterity.,Good,Good,
"Whilst visiting LA we stopped here for breakfast. We knew about Johnny Rockets as we eat in one in San Francisco, and loved it, so excited to find this one. Again it was fab as a treat. I had pancakes and bacon, hubby had the works, which appeared to have all sorts on his plate, but he loved it! We both had lovely coffee which was readily refilled. Friendly staff and nice atmosphere completed a thoroughly lovely breakfast.",Good,Good,Good
"Whenever I head to the USA I must stop in for a meal at Johnny Rockets, they simply have the bets shakes in town and I wish they would open in Australia so I could get one of their shakes at any time! The meals are plentiful and you rarely leave hungry, the service is great and the staff certainly do their best to make sure your happy. This was my first time at JR in Universal but the service and meals were the same as other JR that I have eaten at. All in all, make sure you head for JR next time your in town!",Good,,Good
"I loooooooooved the Route 66 Burger, yuuuuuuuuuummmmooooo. Everyone loved the other burgers as well.",Good,Good,
"This place is pricey but the burgers are great. If you visit the U.S then you have to visit a Johnny Rockets in the city your visiting. The shakes are really nice and are made the old fashioned way, like when I was a kid.",Good,Good,
"We had Good here and really Good, burgers were fab. We had the shakes for drinks which were lovely and you even got the remains of the jug from mixing the shake which was like an ice cream dessert. I would go here just to experience the atmosphere.",Good,Good,Good
"Similar food as other locations for this restaurant. Had sandwiches, no fries, 1 soda, and 3 shakes and it was over $50. Shakes came out early and were melting before we could finish them. I hear that is normal timing though. Service was as to be expected when so busy at this location.",Good,,Good
Place with a different look with a nice and fast food. A bit disapointing it did not had wifi though.,Good,Good,
Last time I was in Los Angeles I went Johnnie Rockets in Santa Monica and loved it!!! The Hollywood store was huge let-down - terrible service!,,,Bad
"this brings back memories of the good old days. burgers, fries, and malts. even if you weren't around in the 50's/60's, you'll still enjoy the nostalgia. Good, fun atmosphere. great for parties, dates, kids.",Good,Good,
"We had breakfast with my family. Coffee and eggs were very delicious, prices were acceptable. Service was very quick",Good,Good,Good
"We were looked after immediately upon arrival, by very pleasant and helpful young people.  The music wasn't too loud and the d√©cor was very reminiscent of the 50s.  The food was pretty good but the Milkshakes are the best I've had in years.",Good,Good,Good
"The food was fabulous. We got the burger and the tuna melt. We had to add fires- so my husband got the works. Kids had the kid meal burgers. They also got a shake- the service was good. The waitress was very friendly. My only complaint- everything is basically al-a-cart its was $65.00  3 Adults, and 2 kids to have lunch. So I thought it was a little pricey- but the food was REALLY REALLY good. Great location!!!",Good,Good,
What can I say... Wish I'd have been born in the 50s... The hamburger was great..the chips were great but the strawberry milkshake I had...WOW...Wow.. Absolutely gorgeous.. Loved the glass it came in. The 50s decor was brill... Both the wife and I are rockabillies so this was a dream to visit.... Did not disappoint.,Good,Good,
"Ate lunch here before heading to Jimmy Kimmel show across the street. Each of us had hamburgers which were cooked/prepared to our liking, shared 2 baskets of fries and a basket of onion rings and did I mention Chocolate Milkshakes... so good (wish I had 1 right now). Would definitely go back",Good,Good,
"Fun american decor, makes for a quick and yummy breakfast. Conveniently close to our hotel and the strip.",Good,Good,
"Love the Philly Cheese Steaks and the Chili Cheese Fries here and they always do good milkshakes.


I wish they still used cream on their milkshakes and not ""whipped topping"" though.",Good,,
"we ate here and the food was very average but very expensive.
I got a chilli dog that fell,apart upon picking it up and was about 5 inches long. And for $7.99 I expected a lot more. For a chain store there is little or no value in eating there.",Bad,,
Convenient location in the H&H Center. Enjoyed the variety of ice cream shake options. Food was fairly average. It has a fun atmosphere.,Good,Good,
"Thus is just as you expect- fresh, tasty burgers in a diner setting. Probably a little high priced (they get you on the drinks!), $30 for 2 burgers and 2 cokes, including tax and tip.",Good,,
"From the servers in paper hats, the 50's vibe and the mini juke boxes, we loved every part of this milk bar.  We ordered thickshakes.  Absolutely awesome.",Good,Good,Good
"Nice diner in retro American style. Good quality food and nice service. reasonable prices! They do photos for family and kids if you eat there, you can get them I you want..",Good,Good,Good
"We had a great, casual meal here and both the adults and teenagers left happy!  I chose a patty melt, others had salad, hot dog, original burger and bacon & cheese fries.  All were delicious!  All that for under $50 and great service?  What's not to love?",Good,Good,Good
"Great staff, delicious chicken club sandwich and wonderful milk shakes!
I enjoyed my few times I've been eatin there while my stay in Hollywood. I definitely recommend and will go back as soon as I am back in L.A.",Good,Good,Good
"Been there a few times, never disappointed. Chicken club Sandwich and milk shakes are just escellent!
Staff is veery nice and sympathetic. I'd go again and again.",Good,Good,Good
"First time at Johnny Rockets was an awesome experience. I had a very tasty Smoke House Double burger with cheese fries. The shakes like years ago. Fantastic atmosphere, you seem to be in the 50's and the staff is very friendly. I recommend it.",Good,Good,Good
"Went to Johnny Rockets for breakfast   I ordered the French toast and it was REALLY good!!!!  Waitress was very friendly and very attentive!!!! Only complaint is, they have NO restroom for their customers!!!!!  So therefore, we couldn't even wash our hands before we ate!!!!!",Good,Bad,Good
Great burgers and milk shakes. The cheesy fries were also delicious. Probably best to book an appointment with your coronary care professional after a meal here! Why is food that tastes this good always bad for you???,Good,,
"Great burgers and a delicious milk shake. This is Johnny Rockets, so no surprises there. Good as usual but no dancing waiters while we were there. Don't look for any healthy eating here. It's a plain old cholesterol fest. Enjoy!!",Good,,Good
"After a long day in the studios, can recomment this JR. Staff was very friendly, food was good and the prices match!",Good,,Good
"I love Johnny Rockets. I usually hate chains. JR gives good value for your money, service is friendly and burgers come quick and taste good. Still a good burger isn't that hard to find anymore, a good milk shake is. I just slurped an Orange Dreamsicle and it was to die for. Check it out!",Good,,Good
"Firstly the theme of the diner is great, really takes you back and added to the experience of our visit. 
The food was good and the milkshakes even better - you have to try one or share one like we did.
The service was average, the staff were not overly attentive and service took a while.
Overall a Good and we would return to a Johnny Rockets again :)",Good,Good,
"Always wanted to try Johnny Rockets Burgers, we were not disappointed.
My wife for the first time actually ate the complete burger / fries & coke.


Look forward to eating there again when we return.",Good,Good,
"Very friendly staff, but did not like that the grown ups got the food fist and the kids got there's last. By the time they got there food the rest of the group was finish. They also give you a complementary picture but its only a hook to sale you other pictures for $15 each or 2 for $20",,,
"Set up like a 50's diner, it was fun and busy. The food tasted okay but the fries were cold. Milkshakes were yummy and had a good range of flavors. Could have done without the person asking if we wanted photos taken as I was there to eat",Good,,
"I am not a big fan of hamburgers, but I tried Johnny Rockets because my friends insisted so much.
It's true that the menu is different from regular hamburger restaurantes. 


I have ordered a chilli burger and had a nice taste, but was a little bit soak.",,,
"Great Service, Best Hamburger in L.A.. As we walked in, we were greeted a ""Hello"" by several staff. Ordered a speciality Hamburger & half n half onion rings & fries. AND. Coke Float. Service was fast, Coke Float was best I've ever had, one tall glass full with another same size tall glass to keep topping up...awesome ! Half n Half arrived with a sauce dip..Yum ! Then the best smelling Hamburger , the taste was everything you could dream of in a Hamburger....definitely the BEST Hamburger in L.A.  ... Atmosphere and ambience was pretty cool too !",Good,Good,Good
We visited Johnny Rockets at Universal Studios after a long day in the Universal Studios Attraction Park. It was very reasonably priced and the service and food quality were excellent. I can really recommend this place,Good,,Good
Good and great atmosphere and music. Its and old fashion dinner with counter and stools.  Brings back memories of the old soda shop.,Good,Good,
It was the average hamburger place.  It had an atmosphere of an old time soda shop and the root beer float I got was very good but the hamburger was just another hamburger!,,Good,
"Just love the chocolate milkshakes. Thick, creamy and full of ice cream... Served in the 50's style glass in keeping with the retro decor of the restaurants.  Individual red juke boxes at every table.  The staff aren't always friendly......",Good,Good,Bad
"Gotta love Johnny Rockets for the milkshakes alone! The burgers are good old cholesterol filled heart attack inducing burgers and they're great! Really good value for money, friendly staff and the place feels a bit quirky, definately worth a visit",Good,Good,Good
"Livery burgers, I chose the veg ""Streamliner"" and wow it was yummy, my wife and daughter had the Rout 66 and loved them. nice retro 50's decor and the staff were superb, they are a credit to this burger bar.",Good,Good,
"Always have amazing quick food here, but the service is always hit and miss, always being forced to tip even when you have a really bad waiter, I'll tip if I feel like I've had a great experience, it's privilege not a mandatory requirement, that's my only disappointment.",Good,,Bad
"Food good, service good, fun place to eat with music and sports television just before entering Universal amusement park.  Post card picture for memento was a very nice touch.",Good,Good,Good
"My family of 5 ate here for dinner and everything was great. Very attentive wait staff, good location, and Good. Milkshakes were especially good!",Good,Good,Good
"The food was good, but the shakes were better! Service a little slow, but ok. Reasonably priced considering its location.",Good,Good,Bad
"We loved the burgers and service so much, we had to visit a second time! The table top Juke Box was a hit!!",Good,Good,Good
This is a really nice place to have a quick bite. The service was good and the food was excellent. They just need to invest a bit more on there tables. They look like if they are really for the 50 n 60 lol..... Other than that food is good.,Good,Bad,Good
Great shakes and a 50's feel. Can be updated a little though. Shakes are jumbo in size with some really nice flavors.,Good,Bad,
Great place to experience an American burger and milkshake. The service was nice and quick + it is in the shopping mall next to the Lowes Hollywood hotel,Good,Good,Good
Try the bacon cheddar single! I've tried many bacon burgers in town and this is the best. Fast service. Big Hamburger. 50 years typical american place. I love it.,Good,Good,Good
"I say Experience because this place is like stepping back in time...Burgers Shakes and in a diner served by dancing staff!


Really cool diner place to grab a lunch and order an amazing shake...good idea letting you keep the remainder of the shake to pour in your glass when you want!


Burgers were pretty spectatular and some huge one's on the mention to give you a challenge to eat!


If your in Hollywood & Highland you gotta check this place out!",Good,Good,Good
"Not bad burgers in a typical burger joint setting, but the fries were a disappointment. Teenagers ordered and then learned bacon cheese fries were not what they expected. Too heavy. 
As part of a hollywood boulevard tourist experience we could have done worse - with a little more research we could probably have done better",,Bad,
"Went to Universal Studios,  instead of eating in the park, decided to eat at Johnny Rockets at the Citywalk.  Where to begin..... Our server Jerry, WAS GREAT!!! This man was on it.  Never an empty cup. Food was not so good...  Had the grilled chicken salad, mostly iceberg lettuce, chicken tasted freezer burned, and the honey mustard dressing was watery.  My party of 4, each ordered a different type of frie, as their burgers don't come with them, all the fries were room temperature and stale/freezer burned, as if they had been under a heat lamp for some time.  One order was the bacon cheese fries, they were soo stale we sent them back for fresh ones. The burgers were ok.  Nothing special about them.
Overall if you enjoy frozen food at high prices, this is the place for you. Will not be returning.",Bad,,Good
Always reliable with Good and a nice atmosphere. This time we did the one at citywalk universal studios and got the added bonus of a free picture!,Good,Good,
"Small choice of menu. Ended up ordering cheesy fries with a Blt. Simple enough. Quality of food was bad however I could have ploughed through.. Until I tasted the cheese in the fries. I don't know what processed rubbish it was but swear it was made out of plastic. I was with 3 friends all found the processed, plastic taste revolting. 
To make the evening worse, we were the only people in the restaurant with a handful of staff. Our waitress came over and my friends paid cash while I requested to pay by card to which she happily replied she'd sort it right away. As we were the on,y people in the restaurant I had expected quick service however 25 minutes later I looked over to find her sitting on a restaurant table snap chatting on her phone. She finally sorted my card out after persistently asking although due to her lack of care and attention she actually charged me too little. Due to my Bad of the restaurant I didn't point this out. Would not return.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We visited both the Johnny Rockets in Santa Monica where we sat at the bar and also at the Hollywood/ Highland Johnny Rockets where we sat in a booth. Its a 1950's diner with old school outfits worn by the staff and rock and roll music.  You get a really quick service by the staff to take your order and for the food. Both times I had the #12 as it is the original cheeseburger from the day they opened. It is a delicious cheeseburger with lettuce white onion, pickles, mayonnaise & their signature chili ketchup. At the Santa Monica JR we also had unlimited fries too which was great- not sure they they didnt have this at the Hollywood/ Highland branch. Both time we really enjoyed our food.",Good,Good,Good
"Management waited on us at the bar, quick, excellent experience! Had sweet potato fries and an original burger. Delicious!",Good,Good,Good
"Went looking for somewhere to have lunch and stumbled across Johnny Rockets.  Looked like a throw back to the typical 1950's dining set up and service.  For a change, we decided to sit up at the counter, as opposed to sitting at a table or booth.  The entire cooking experience is laid out for all to see is the open plan kitchen and prep area, which is great.  The service from entry to exit was fantastic and the food was incredible.  We opted for different variations of fully loaded buns and sandwiches, all of which were unbelievably tasty.  To round off the great experience, the bill was more than reasonable compared to some of the other options we'd tried in the area.",Good,Good,Good
"Having been to the USA many times before, I am surprised that we never chose to dine at Johnny Rockets, so it was a really pleasant surprise to find that having chosen here as a lunch stop in Hollywood we had a great meal. I went for the Philly cheesesteak - it was absolutely scrum my - wish I was eating another one now in fact........it was so good. Although the restaurant was busy(another good indicator) the manager was efficiently managing best use of staff and tables and in a very pleasant manner(as were all of his staff) food came out hot, fresh and very tasty. Ambience is nostalgic with reminisces of 50's/60's fun times era- really good music.
A definite place to return to.",Good,Good,Good
We came here for breakfast and ordered the breakfast sandwich and pancakes. The sandwich was finger licking good. i chose a song on the table's tiny jukebox and it came on! It was a lovely touch. We rock and rolled whilst seated!,Good,Good,
Went for the diner experience but were disappointed.  Place didn't feel clean and the staff were friendly but disinterested.  Average food.,,Bad,Bad
the place was nice and like happydays but if you wanted a chicken burger they wanted to charge $1.50 more.... ?????,Bad,Good,
"This time, I would like to share my experience in dining at Johnny Rockets which was located in the 3rd fl. of Hollywood & Highland Center shopping mall & entertainment complex in Hollywood Blvd., nearby Mann's Chinese Theatre, a famous spot in Hollywood Blvd. It all started when we visited the area and as it got dark, we decided to dine in at Johnny Rockets which was located in the 3rd fl.


When we got there, the place was almost fully packed where we saw only 1~2 empty tables. At first, we were seated in a smaller table but after waiting for few minutes, a larger table was available so while we were waiting for the table to be cleaned up, we started placing our order. We both ordered two different burgers as I preferred to have medium rare beef in my burger while my wife preferred the beef to be well done in hers. Plus, we ordered a glass of strawberry milkshake as we knew we could not finish our meals if we ordered two glasses of milkshakes.


Within 15 minutes, our burgers and milkshake were served and we both didn't waste any time and started eating them. For me, it was a burger I am dying for. Personally, I am not really a burger's lover but it is extremely difficult for me to refuse an offer especially for such delicious burgers prepared by Johnny Rockets as they offer fine quality burgers. Their burger's quality is not easy to be matched and although they are quite pricey but it's really worth paying it.


Another good quality chain burger's restaurants that falls within similar price range, would be Mos Burger, an international chain restaurants originated from Japan. But make no mistake, based on my personal experience, these chain restaurants are not successfully maintain their food quality overseas. For instance, Johnny Rocket burger's quality in Bali was way off compare to original one in US and so does Mos Burger. Their burgers' quality in one of their Singapore's outlet was also way different than the one in Japan several years ago.


Therefore, based on my last experience in dining at Johnny Rockets in their Hollywood Blvd.'s outlet, I would really recommend this place to every one who is looking for fine quality burgers in Hollywood area.",Good,Good,
"The staff was very friendly.
The burgers where very tasty and big, the Sweet fries where also very good.
It is more expensive than other fast food places but we had a very good meal.",Good,,Good
It's taste very good . Would recommend I tried the original johnny rocket burger . Bread is soft and taste good .,Good,,
"Okay for guys, eggs won't be poached but overall Denny's style food in a Hollywood mall. Coffe was good, service OK and the 50s style is fun.",Good,Good,Good
Wanted a good burger and fries and was not disappointed.  Service was quick.  Typical diner food.  Topped off the meal with strawberry and banana milk shake.  Yummy.,Good,,Good
"The only big negative is the occasional line and lack of seating. JR's is a retro style American diner, with fresh, made to order burgers and fries. My favorite items are the chili fries and malts. If you love American style food, JR's will not disappoint your stomach.",Good,,
"We stopped in for lunch as we toured the Peterson Museum, and had the best burger of our US trip. Tasty, fresh, filling, great sides in a clean and retro environment",Good,Good,Good
"The food was tasty and service was so-so, but the overly loud jukebox-like music and costly food made us decide never to go back there.",Good,Bad,
"Fantastic service from the minute we stepped inside. Friendly & fun place to have a meal. Completely themed, including music & staff uniform. Would recommend to everyone",Good,Good,Good
"We visited Johnny Rockets - the original hamburger - at 6060 Wiltshire Blvd, LA, (not the address listed on Hollywood Blvd) it has part of an old car stuck up high up on the wall outside,  50s style restaurant.  the one on Wiltshire is great, so busy which is a good sign the food is good, and the staff are great.  Service very quick despite the fact they are so busy, very friendly, and of course the food excellent.  A must eat place specially after a visit to Petersen Car Museum as you can walk from one to the other from inside the restaurant.",Good,Good,Good
You enter the place and you like it immediately. Nice 50's dinner vibe with nice music. The problem is the overpriced food. It is merely a burger filled with loads of sauces and the french fries are purchased separately! The people working there were very nice and accommodating.,Bad,Good,Good
"Sandwiches and fries done 50's diner style. Great food, excellent service. Try the sweet potato fries - yum!",Good,,Good
"We ate here one evening as were tired and weren't in the mood to go somewhere far from our hotel. As it is called Eddie Rockets at home in Ireland I knew what to expect. Food was good, though a bit on the greasy side. Staff were not the friendliest and that reflected in our tip to them!",,,
"We visited your universal studios sports restaurant Middle March 2014 for dinner. We travelled from Australia with 3 kids ages 5, 3 and 10mths old. Our trip of a lifetime was perfect until we entered your business. We ordered shakes, chicken salad, hot dogs and burgers. That night myself, my 5yr old son and my 10mth old daughter(who is breast fed, so whatever I eat affects her) were all violently ill with gastro/vomiting. We had burgers. It was horrendous and I've never felt so sick, then to think my two babies went through this. I advise do not order from this restaurant. The next day we planned Hollywood walk of fame and Beverly Hills etc
However, we couldn't get out of bed and this being our last day in LA. This place ruined our trip. Someone needs to be accountable for food safety and the health of people. Disgusting Johnny Rockets, your manager should be ashamed!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
Our waiter was fantastic! Prompt service and super friendly. The food was hot and fresh and it was 10:30 at night. This one is at Hollywood and Highland and the views to Hollywood Blvd (outside the restaurant) are awesome.,Good,Good,Good
"We try to avoid chains while on vacations, but Johnny Rocket's is always a treat for us.  This location was no different than other JR.  Good burgers and shakes in a 50's theme diner.  If you are looking for friendly service and a good old fashioned burger and fries without standing at a counter, this is the place.",Good,Good,Good
"This restaurant attached to the Petersen Automotive Museum offers a modern version of an old fashioned diner. I would definitely suggest their malts. Great staff, very friendly as well as quick service.",Good,Good,Good
"This Johnny Rockets wasn't the best one I've ever been to, but it was still good. They have good fries.",Good,,
We were seated promptly and our waitress gave us a lot of attention and quick service.  Food was fresh and tasty.,Good,,Good
Quick service chocolate milkshake awesome.Loved the 50's music and the burgers and fries.To be healthy I ordered the garden salad that was great tasting.Great location will go to Johnny Rocket again,Good,Good,
"The proper place for a hangout with your friends for a reasonable price.


The burgers at Johnny Rockets were one of the best I had in CA for that amount of money",Good,Good,
Stumbled upon Johnny Rockets after making a wrong turn on our way to Hollywood. Decided to have lunch there and we all had a great experience. Unlimited fries with any burger. Big shakes. Great food. Great atmosphere. Very good prices.,Good,Good,
I was feeling a little peckish so called in to order a serve of sweet potato fries to go. Well I got enough to feed a mob!  Lucky I am staying close by so will reheat some tomorrow.,Good,,
"Had the best chilli fries here!! Completey smothered in cheese!! Service was great and heaps cheap to eat. The burgers taste fresh and the milkshakes were awesome. Bad for anyone on a diet but totally worth every calorie!!!
At one point the staff came out from behind the counter and started singing and dancing, very entertaining.",Good,Good,Good
"A fabulous retro diner-style restaurant with fun decor and an excellent menu.  The hamburgers, chips and milkshakes are all to-die-for and the price is very reasonable.  Would definitely go here again.",Good,Good,
"We went there for the typical ""American diner ambiance"" and we weren't disappointed. Although we were surprised by the early closing hour, service was still good and we weren't rushed out and had time to enjoy our meal.
Their milkshakes are delicious, and so are the burgers!
I didn't know it was a franchise until I saw other ones throughout our stay, but at least now I know it's worth it!",Good,Good,Good
"Its old style American milk bar food. Burgers are great. Really cute and probably more for tourists, but we loved it.",Good,Good,
"Meals were cheap nothing to write home about, did the job well tho. In and out service. Don't expect miracles here",Good,,Good
"If you wanna try the best burgers ever and have them in an original american burger restaurant this is the place. The burgers are so juicy and fresh, the shakes are fantastic and don't forget the chili cheese fries. 
If you are a foreigner and haven't been brought up on burgers you must try this.",Good,,
"Hopefully you workout if you wanna eat here and suffer no consequences. Saying that it isn't like that eating here then and again. The menu for milkshakes is as follows (1000 callories for most of them): Strawberry banana, Banana and chocolate (ask for oreo added!) Chocolate Madness, Black FOrrest (choc and cherries).... an as for the burgers.... lots of choice too in single and double layer. These are the remnants of old school type diners from Back to the Future part 1 almost. You can almost picture ordering a chocolate milk from someone called Louis and it instantly being slided across the bar. Every time I come out to the states I visit once or twice. I wouldn;t eat here every day for the sake of my own arteries but I love how great it all tastes. Even now have sweet potatoe fries too.",Good,,
Loved Johnny Rockets sitting outside and people watching. Food good especially shakes! Kids wanted burgers after Mom and Dad enjoyed a few more Gourmet choices earlier in trip.,Good,Good,
"Every time we go to Hollywood, we stop off for a hamburger and Malt at Johnny Rockets. The decor is old school fun, the hamburgers and fabulous, and the malts are out of this world! Did I mention the service was great too???",Good,Good,Good
Nice little diner that is straight out of the '50s. Good and milkshakes and really quick and friendly service.,Good,Good,Good
"We went here last night (9/12/13) we ordered route 66, sweet potato fries, the original, and single smoke house. The single smoke house is the highlight! The route 66 was awesome but it's kindda messy to eat.


Our server Angela was really kind, the kindest so far :D
I came from Sydney where the tips is not compulsory, and the costumer service in the restaurant often be sucks, so I do give her a thumbs up for her CS and we don't mind at all to give about 20% tips for it!",Good,,Good
"As far as chain restaurants go, Johnny Rockets is pretty good. They make a great veggie burger called The Streamliner which I had twice and their milkshakes are flavorful and silky. Attentive waitstaff help keep this busy restaurant on an even keel. If you are in the Hollywood & Highland Complex, this is a great mid priced option.",Good,Good,Good
"Service was great, attentive and not over the top. I was scared off eating what I wanted after seeing the calorie count on the menu. The waiter informed us that they legally had to do it! Food was quick and tasted like typical burger and fries. Shake was delicious! I'm not a big burger fan but wanted the USA experience. What we got was a decent sized meat at a reasonable price with a great atmosphere.",Good,Good,Good
First time in a Johnny Rockets.  Honestly the best burgers we have ever eaten. Amazing thick shakes as well. Couldn't eat all of the burger and fries. Was very well priced and will be eating at them again. All staff are in cool old school uniforms.,Good,Good,Good
"Great Burgers, Shakes and Onion Rings. My favourite eat on the GO place in LA. Clean restuarant with cfurte touch of mini jukeboxes on the table.",Good,Good,
"Was surprised how nice the Burgers were here, but the Shakes were the nicest I have had, so thick and yummy, would return for those alone!  The service was good and reasonably quick, very friendly.  Naturally there were TVs showing whatever the Game of the Day was, by the end of my trip, may just have figured out Grid Iron.",Good,Good,Good
"This diners nice, clean and the staff are friendly. Its ok if you wanted somewhere to have a quick breakfast or lunch, but we went to Kitchen 24 instead.",Good,Good,Good
We enjoyed a delicious lunch here. Old fashioned service with a smile. Food came fast and it was good. Our server was super friendly.,Good,,Good
"If you are looking for some nice and big juicy burgers then Johnny Rockets would definitely be the place to eat at. The restaurant is set up like the burger joints from the 50s and 60s, and the atmosphere is very nice. Plus I want to add that Johnny Rockets in my opinion has the best burgers out of all the burger places known to man.",Good,Good,
This place is redoncoulous there is nothing like it in Australia food was amazing and the price is very reasonable and I loved the old diner feel reminded me of grease hehe,Good,Good,
I make it a point to go to Johnny Rockets at least a couple times when I visit Hollywood. The wait staff is friendly and I like the food there .,Good,,Good
"If you want a real american milkshake experience this place gives it.  We had a milkshake each and a chocolate brownie desert - couldn't finish it all - really wanted to but simply couldn't.  We were there about 10pm and so saw some interesting sights - lots of young females coming in for a drunken burger feast, made us giggle.",Good,Good,
"Visited the one in Santa Maria and had a great dinner after a nice walk in the square.


The whole resturant was so welcoming. You could fee the happy vibes.",Good,Good,
This place was really cool. The waiters are very friendly and fun. The burgers tasted scrumptious and the cheese and bacon fries is a must. The decore is very old school diner but nice.,Good,Good,Good
"We had never been to a Johnny Rockets before and tried the one on Melrose in Hollywood. We were very surprised by the great service, this is not just a regular fast food joint. The atmosphere was great and we felt very comfortable. The food was also great, much better than regular fast food. Definitely try the chocolate shake, one of the best I have ever had.",Good,Good,Good
"Found this off the beaten track, but was enjoyable for lunch. Menu reasonable, food and drink good and service was great. would recommend if you want a snack and not a proper meal.",Good,,Good
Johnny Rockets is a place to go for that old school burger diner feel and food. If your gonna dine with this type of food go all the way and get the chilli cheese fries with your burger and float. A splurge type place for good fatty food.,Good,Good,
"Great beef Burgers and Milk Shakes , nice and friendly service
located on the first floor of the MALL",Good,,Good
"Looking for a cheap meal with an amazing burger? Then stop at Johnny Rockets across from the Loews hotel. Service was a little slow, but food was good and price point was right for lunch. Try the meatless burger; it won't disappoint!",Good,,Bad
"Great easy food here. Our melts were awesome and so fresh.


Service was quick and friendly. Was our first quick meal when we arrived in USA.


Good casual restaurant at great prices too.",Good,Good,Good
"Burgers were good, pickles were GREAT!  Tables could have been a little cleaner, I was so glad I had a Lysol wipe with me!",Good,Bad,
We ate breakfast in several of their restirants in LA. Food and service was great and the breakfast set you up for the day,Good,,Good
"By far it was one of the best burgers eaten at a restaurant like this.  Order of fries was way more than enough.  The were plenty of toppings to choose from, burgers were cooked just right, and juicy.  Don't forget to stop there if you ever down in Hollywood",Good,,
"The Retro furniture and style of the restaurant made it fun. the Service was good, the waiters not all young so you got good old fashioned help. The food came out quickly but they didn't rush you out the door when finished even though people were waiting for tables..  they had a bench for those waiting to be seated which was a good idea having seen how busy it was.  Felt like I was on the set of ""Happy Days""..keep up the service Johnny Rockey!",Good,Good,Good
We came in with a group of 12 told them we had 45 minutes before our tour and they got our order and we had our food with plenty of time to sit and chat - GREAT service and Good!!!!,Good,,Good
The Burgers were HUGE! Our server was so PLEASANT and FUN!!!  The ambiance is total fast food 50's. The malts were kind of on the small side. French fries okay (big basket of em!) and the onion rings were wonderful! I know I will eat at a Johnny Rocket's again. Fun to eat at that location!,Good,Good,Good
"I love Jonhny's milk shake. For me that's the best place to go for after a hot day to get a milk shake. Also, they have good hamburgers and salads. Very friendly place to go. I recommend.",Good,Good,Good
"Yummy, freash, tasty and cheap :) would recommend. It was very fast to. Service was great. Loved the look of the old school kitchen.",Good,Good,Good
"Yet another burger joint but nice food and staff. 50's theme , think of Happy days. Not badly priced.",Good,Good,Good
"I think that this restaurant is probably more enjoyable to the youngsters (I am 50+). The waiter was friendly & efficient, the food portions huge - but not much to write home about. Pretty average burgers & fries restaurant - even to my young adult children.",,,Good
"The restaurant is decked out as an old style diner from the 50's... lots of chrome and red and white livery.  I kept expecting Sandy and Danny to pop out of the woodwork, it was very authentic!   We loved it.  The food was typical ""All - American"",  it arrived fresh, hot and fast.
The beverages were typically Americano as well and my friend enjoyed a Root beer, another had a malt shake and I had a coke-float and revisited my youth!  
The mini-jukeboxes on the table are supposed to sort the music playing - you can choose a tune for a quarter from the 'juke box' tune list however in the time we were there we didn't hear any of the songs we had paid for and chosen...however the tunes playing were enjoyable and hopefully later diners enjoyed our choices !   That was the only thing wrong (and it really wasn't a problem!!!! <<<just saying)  Our server Jerred  was great, couldn't have asked for a better service actually.  He was attentive and seems to intuitively know when the drinks were down, or napkins were needed etc.  
Johnny Rockets is the Americano experience you would like if you are a ""Grease""  movie fan or 50's freak... Elvis, Dion and the Belmonts and Frankie Valley featured on the playlist... it's great for a catch-up with friends or a longer visit",Good,Good,Good
Service was ok but the burgers dripped so much oil  i needed to hold it above the plate to drain and left me feeling ill afterwards,Bad,,Good
waited for service and no one helped us.  Multiple servers walked by and looked at our table noticing nothing was there but never asked to help us... so we just got up and left.,,Bad,Bad
"Had been to Johnny Rockets at home so knew what to atmosphere and food was like, fun, enjoyable and love the burgers.  Our waiter must have a off day.  It was like he would forget about us which thankfully it was after we had our meal.  Took us forever to get our check.",Good,Good,Bad
"If you love onion rings, step right up.  If you want your kids to party in the ketchup, cheese, grease, park them here.  If you think you can safely find something healthy-ish on the menu, choose a PF Changs or CPK instead.  If you want inexpensive, get yourself a coupon and enjoy yourself.",Good,Good,
"We stopped here during our lunchtime visit whilst on a city tour. We had the burgers here which were beautiful and cooked to perfection. The service is friendly and quick. Would recommend the peanut butter and chocolate milkshake here, just over a 1000 calories, if you can't indulge on holiday, when an you eh! 


Great value for money this restaurant in the heart of hollywood",Good,Good,Good
"Visited during our vacation from UK. The service, atmosphere and food were all excellent and great value too. We had a great time and it was great to see serving staff earning their gratuity rather than just expecting it! Definitely recommended.",Good,Good,Good
"The old style diner atmosphere appeals to us and this diner did not disappoint. The service was fast and efficient, the food was well cooked and presented and tasted great. The air conditioning was set to ""icy cold"" so it was freezing in there. Some people may like this but it felt too cold for us and we were glad to get out into the heat. There are no toilets in the restaurant, customers have to walk out of the diner and round the corner to the facilities in the mall. (I did think they were joking at first). The food makes this place worth a visit just wear a pullover and use the loo before you go in.",Good,Good,Good
We had lunch at Johnny Rocket's.  We loved the look of the old school american diner.  We were not too thrilled on the meals though.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong meals for each of us.  It was disappointing.,Bad,Good,
"Burgers and french fries were quite good, but what we liked the most was the atmosphere (old style decoration and music) and very friendly service.",Good,Good,Good
"The awesome ambience will set u back probably in the 80s? When we entered, no one greeted us. Probably because we were asians? (who knows).. when we took our seats.. the waiter came up later than we anticipated.. the staffs didnt smile at all.. and there werent even alot of customers! anyway, the food was really nice.. huge portion though.. shakes were out of this world!",Good,Good,Bad
"We just ate here and it was so bad! The server was rude for the beginning, didn't refill our drinks, the food was really below par! The onion rings were in-edible. I'd never eat here again. Such a shame.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I love the veggie burger, and the half/half fries and onion rings are super yummy. The place is just simple oldies diner fun, must go",Good,Good,
"Amazingly great , probably lethal burgers. Fast and friendly service. No barriers on carbs and fat here.",Good,,Good
"Took a 'pit-stop' here for lunch whilst on a LA Insider Tour. Staff were friendly, surroundings were authentic, food was plentiful and delicious!",Good,Good,Good
Good consistent food prepared well and fast. It's always good to have staff that are good at their job and are nice.,Good,,Good
Food was average to good but the theme made a fun  place to lunch. Drinks and shakes like you got years ago.,Good,Good,
"Especially if you need something quick, I ate here twice over a few days as I was on a schedule. First I had breakfast at counter. I told the counter man I was in a rush and he had my coffee poured and my egg sandwich in place in a few minutes. The next day I went in for lunch, sat in a booth and had a delicious burger. The meat tasted like quality meat.",Good,,Good
"What a surprise! After 3 weeks travelling on very ordinary, tasteless food, this was a great change. The burgers actually tasted like their individual ingredients rather than being buried in a bland sauce. The burgers here taste like burgers did before the other fast food people took over.",Good,,
We went to Johnny Rockets at the Dolby Theatre area and it had just reopened. The servers were fast and friendly. The food is as aspected and prices are great. It is a fun spot to be at for kids too.,Good,Good,Good
"been to many similar places to this in england but it was good fun actually going into a proper 'american diner' had a burger and a shake which is kind of obligatory! had to take it away as we had to catch our tour bus, the staff were super helpful and friendly when we asked to change the order and the food was so so good! lovely lay out just what i expected, cute little juke boxes playing 50 tunes for 5c. loved it, reccomend, quite cheap!",Good,Good,Good
"great food! i love eating here because it is 50's. This place is fairly cheap and kid-friendly. If you come here, get the milkshakes. They are the best milkshakes ever! Vibe and service are good, and staff is quick.",Good,Good,Good
"We used to have lunch in the Johnny Rockets on the Highland center, it was perfectly located, the service is great, everything is so tasty and it is really cheap!!",Good,Good,Good
Stopped here for breakfast and the staff was so welcoming and amazing.   The restaurant was exceptionally clean and so 50s and the food was great.,Good,Good,Good
"Ok, so you've got to try this at least once.


The food is definitely NOT fine dining, but the experience is American Diner all the way.


This is a great location at the Hollywood & Highland Shopping Centre. We had breakfast here - scrambled eggs, pancakes, drip-filter coffee and OJ for the kids.


Food is as expected, prices are very cheap and you get big servings. The waitress was lovely and very attentive. 


I loved the atmosphere with the old-style counters, booths and pictures on the walls.  Well worth a visit.",Good,Good,Good
"I went with a friend after a movie and we had a fun time.  It's not to different from all the other Johnny Rockets, there's a nice view onto the street looking out at El Capitan Theatre.  The food is good and the service is great.  It's not overly expensive and it's always a fun choice.",Good,Good,Good
"We had dinner here one night. Food was good and arrived quickly.   Friendly service.  Fun to go here just say ""been there, done that""",Good,Good,Good
"This was our first meal when we arrived in LA. I know it is a chain and for those in the US probably a more upmarket version of McDonalds! However ‚Äì being from the UK it has that American Diner feel, with great food ‚Äì giant burgers and great sandwiches. Probably ideal for fussy eaters or a quick meal without spending too much money. I have found the burgers here nicer than some burger restaurants charging a lot more money!",Good,Good,
"Fast service with a smile. Reasonably priced with a great atmosphere. Great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Plenty to do in the surrounding area because it is in the heart of Hollywood, at the Highland Center.",Good,Good,Good
Very clean. Plenty of memorabilia from the old days (50's-60s) adds to an entertaining and pleasant atmosphere. Prices are good.,Good,Good,
Our flight was delayed so we arrived late to our hotel. We went in search for a quick dinner as it was late. Johnny Rockets was open and was a perfect start to our first night in LA. Enjoyed the 50s feel and the burgers were good.,Good,Good,
"Well done. 
Tasty food and a feel good 1950s diner restaurant. 
50s music and great table service. 
Milkshakes and root beer float was great too. 
Yum.",Good,Good,Good
My travel friend is addicted to this place - I'm not but I did enjoy my Philly Cheese Steak enough to entice me back a second time.  Worth going at least once to one of the chains,Good,,
No surprise. Fair value for money. The food is very fat. We can recommend the very tasty milk shakes. Boys enjoyed it.,Good,,
There is a range of burgers to chhoose from and the prices are affordable. The service is great and there is a good vibe to the place. Conveniently located in the mall at Hollywood.,Good,Good,Good
We ate here twice - it was cheap and cheerful and the service was friendly.  Take a jacket as the aircon was very cold - too cold for me.,Good,Bad,Good
"If you like your burgers and you love the idea of sitting in a proper booth, with juke box and pvc seating, then don't miss JR!",Good,Good,
"Really enjoyed my first visit into Jonny Rockets Diner, we was out for the day on Hollywood Boulevard and had taken a Star Line bus tour of the city and when we got back to the Chinese Theatre to snap away the Hollywood Walk Of Fame we went inside the shopping mall to get a little rest from the hot sun and to grab a refreshing drink, as we only wanted a light bite we stumbled upon Johnny Rockets and the menu appealed to all of us in the party just a small sandwich of some kind. We was overwhelmed at the warm friendly greeting from the staff inside and was seated straight away it was fairly busy and they explained that meals might take about 20-30 mins but we wasn't in a rush, we was happy to wait and gave us time to have a rest and take the weight off our feet but to our suprise the food came quite quick. All the meals came freshly cooked and no waste at all even though they were a larger portion than what we thought they were going to be. I had the Chicken Grilled Sandwich and ever mouth full was delightful and so tasty, sometimes the chicken can be processed at some places but this most definatley was not 100% pure chicken breast, other members of my family had the Philly Cheese Steak and they said this was the best beef sandwich they had tasted in a long time. The prices are very reasonable and what was exceptional about the visit you get a little jukebox on the table and can select your own music but need small change which the servers are happy to sort out for you. I highly recoommend this place",Good,Good,Good
"Had a late lunch at this place as we were staying nearby.  The deco was fun and has that 50s' atmosphere. Service is good, no complaint.  Food wise, although I sort of expected it to be a bit heavy for my taste, I was still shocked after the first bite and drink. But my five year old son loved it!  I felt that both the shakes and the burgers could give someone a heart attack.  The sweet patato fries are OK. 


Don't think I will go to another Johnny Rockets, it's just not my type of food.",Bad,Good,Good
"Standard Johnny Rockets, not bad, not great.  Just what you would expect.  


We had burgers, chilli cheese fries and they tasted the same as they do in PA, NY and anywhere else we visit a Johnny Rockets.  


I am not a fan of the ice cream they use for their shakes and desserts, but the burgers were great and the kids love the singing",,Good,
"I Love Johnny rocket! their Philly cheese steak sandwich is the BEST and also LOVE their malt milkshake, O and also LOVE THEIR CHEESE FRIES!!",Good,,
"First visit toJohnny Rockets for a brunch fantastic, could not move afterwards, but good value for money, great retro decor and excellent and friendly service.",Good,Good,Good
The staff was really friendly. The food arrived fast and was good. The staff was also really quick on refilling your glass once you drank it. I recommend this to everyone!,Good,,Good
"Basic fare - hamburgers, sandwiches, shakes based on 50""s style decor and theme. Food decent. Served very quickly. Super friendly staff and love the table side jukeboxes.",Good,Good,Good
Great food great atmosphere! Friendly service! I recommend it to everybody and I will be back for sure,Good,Good,Good
"The food was great, the servers were awesome! I'd recommend it to everybody and I will be back for sure!",Good,,Good
Just Ok. Limited menu compared to Johnny Rockets in NY-no mozzarella sticks. Food was average. Service was good. Very small inside. Clean.,,Good,Good
"Liked the juke box and the individual juke box choices on the tables! Pop music of this era plays in the background while you are eating.
The only thing I didn't like was the music was too loud and the air conditioning was ice cold a few times.",,,
"Sorry guys, but this place is dirty, the tables are greasy and the staff walks with stained aprons. The food is not bad, the milk shakes are really good, but it has to be cleaner!",Good,Bad,Bad
"The day we were there they had a bunch of people working in the kitchen, someone that appeared to be the manager looking around and one poor guy waiting all the tables.  He could not keep up at all.  The food is typical of a greasy spoon so if you are into that then go for it.  There wasn't one healthy thing on the menu and we only went here as it was the closest thing open to where we were.",Bad,,Bad
We went to the very first Johnny Rockets on Melrose Ave...it was awesome and the burgers and fries were the best ever!!!,Good,Good,
"I love Johnny Rockets! 
As a rockabilly gal we had to go in and it was fab,amazing decor and atmosphere. Even for non rockabilly fans,they will love it! 
Me and my boyfriend felt like we were back in the 50s with simple food,the shakes are amazing and really great value food,and the best chilli ive ever tasted!",Good,Good,
Yum!!! The orignal burget was delicious along with a chocolate shake. Service was great!,Good,,Good
"The atmosphere here is really awesome.  Gets you in the mood for burgers and shakes!


The menu was quite good as well.  Took a bit of time to figure out what my husband and I wanted, because there were so many things we wanted to try.  I got The Houston, and it was awesome!  Enough jalapenos to keep it spicy through out.  I usually get bored with burgers, so seeing this on the menu made my night.


Things were a bit on pricey side versus what we got.  The burgers were great, but for like $7.50 for my burger, all I got was a burger.  They don't offer fries with them, which was a disappointment.  It can easily add up here if you like fries with your burgers.  We just made the best of it and ordered a couple of sides (chili fries, and a bowl of chili) to make up the fact the burgers came without fries.  Still, the sides were a bit pricey for what we got, but the food was good so I guess it worked out in the end.",Good,Good,
"We popped in here for a quick bite after missing lunch and received great service.  Lots of choice on the menu for meat lovers and vegetarians.  I can't compare because it's my first but I had the Philly Cheese Steak and loved it.  So much so, it's what I ordered when I visited Melrose (which is the original Johnny Rockets).  


The 50's style decor was a lovely touch and enjoyed grabbing a bite to eat here.  There are alot of burger places to eat and not living in America, it can be over-facing with so many places to choose to eat.  This is a reliable name I now trust when I return.",Good,Good,Good
"Great location, food of a high standard with excellent service and vale for money.",Good,,Good
"After a short wait in line, we were seated and our order was taken. I ordered the original and it was just too blah and over cooked for me, even after adding extra ketchup and salt! When the server asked if everything was alright I said ""no not really"". I was quickly offered a replacement which I declined. He then took the unfinished burger away. A surprise was learning that they only serve Pepsi products... but in Coca Cola glasses!! I would think that would be frowned upon by BOTH of these brand giants! When the bill came, it was a nice surprise to see that my burger had been deducted from the bill. I do appreciate that! 


We were also treated to a little R-E-S-P-E-C-T from the servers! Nice dance moves guys!",Bad,,Good
"Decor was quite good (but not great) but the burgers were awful. We were expecting the king of burgers, and what we got was the joker. I ordered lemonade and it was undrinkable. The fries were very average. They even got our order wrong. I don't know if all their stores are the same, but this one was below average and the worst food we had in our entire trip. Even Denny's left this place for dead. There is so much Good all around here, I'd avoid it all together.",Bad,,Bad
Being vegetarian can be a challenge in the USA...but Johnny Rockets have a soy meat veggie burger called the Streamliner that is delicious! And the '50's atmosphere is great! Recommended!,Good,Good,
"I love Johnny Rockets, but service at all of them is not so hot.",Good,,Bad
"We ate at the Johnny Rockets in the Hollywood Highland Mall and in the Venetian in Las Vegas. Both times we loved the Streamliner Burger which was a soy burger with the sensational dill pickles, Heinz American Mustard, lettuce and fried onions, and fries...I had an Orange Dreamsicle which admittedly could have been more orangey but anyway, overall I loved the atmosphere of the one in the Hollywood Highland Mall, and the one in the food court at the Venetian didn't disappoint either.",Good,Good,
"It was busy when we went, so we were seated at the counter.  It was interesting to watch the cook and assembly stations, that were open for us to see.  


The food was good and enough!!!!  What you would wish for in a themed chain restaurant.",Good,Good,
"This was a fun place to have a burger, throw back to the 50's diner.",,Good,
"Neat little restaurant.  Location was good, but kind of small.  Booths were crowded.  Staff was friendly, but food was average and over priced.  They make a big deal about dispensing straws and making faces in dishes with ketchup.  Not a requirement to visit twice.",Bad,,
"Super crowded the day we were there, but the service folks did a good job under the circumstances.  It's definitely an experience vs. great food - the food was OK, but not great.",,Good,Good
"We at the Johnny Rockets in the Union Bank Plaza in Downtown LA for lunch recently, we must of have gotten there prior to the crowd becuase it did get very busy.  The food is quick and very good for a burger place, the prices are ok and the service was very nice.  The resturant was clean and everything was well maintained.",Good,Good,Good
"If you want to feel like you have stepped back in time to the days when life was simpler, this is the place to be. Good simple food at  a reasonable price, prompt and friendly service.",Good,Good,Good
We ate at the Hollywood Johnny Rockets at least once a day while we stayed there.  Extremely yummy affordable food with very Good.,Good,,Good
Dont order the tea. ..water luke warm and liptons.. Portions are huge.....,,,
Long line that is outside and they seat you from the line. They dont let you wait inside for a seat. FooD Is better At TheiR UnIVersaL CitYWalK LocATioN:).,Good,Good,Bad
"Long line to get in, long wait to get served, average Johnny Rockets meals... There are definitely better JR else where in LA.",,Bad,Bad
"Johnny Rockets was always clean and fresh with delicious burgers.  We found the staff friendly and at the Santa Monica shop they even did a dance for us, which was very entertaining - thanks guys!",Good,Good,Good
"Very friendly staff,,food tasty and great value here in august and loved it",Good,Good,Good
"Very poor service!  The food that we ordered was wrong - wings so spicy they burned your lips - our 10 year old couldn't eat them.  There was a puddle of water in the bottom of my salad bowl.  When we told our server, he just shrugged his shoulders and walked away.  When we were about to pay, another server did discount our bill.  We didn't go back!",,Bad,Bad
"As chains go, this isn't bad.  Been to Johnny Rockets a couple of times, once in Vegas & then LA.  They do decent burgers & lots of other diner classics at reasonable prices.  I loved the Route 66 burger, but be careful, it's a messy one !  For a more authentic diner feel try Mel's.",Good,Bad,
Just had dinner at Johnny Rockets. Service was fantastic. Food was great. Strongly recommended.,Good,Good,Good
"My first experience of a Johnny Rockets. The 'store' front itself seemed a little on the dirty/run down side of things, but the food was great for a burger chain. 
My mother ordered the sliders and I had a bacon & cheese burger. 
Not much to say about a fast food chain other than yes or no but this place was pretty good, and I do like a good hamburger!",Good,Bad,
"We visited Johnny Rockets on our 2nd day in America and loved it. The food was great, simple burgers, hotdogs, onion rings, fries, milkshakes. And it was very inexpensive and was great value! Loved the 50s style diner theme also!",Good,Good,
"Cookie cutter burger, dogs, and fries for the upscale masses",Good,,
"I like this restaurant cause it has a sign that says""christina eats here""",,Good,
good boca burgers,Good,,
Why pretend I dont love and orginal with everything on it?,Good,,
you can't beat the simplicity of this place.  It's easy and delicious.,Good,Good,
"Burgers, fries, malts or shakes. Always good to me!",Good,,
"Terrible food and drinks, nice servers. We stopped for lunch while waiting for a room. Seated quickly. Ordered a drink with dark rum and they got the cheapest bottle of Myers rum- truly awful drink. Wife had chicken finger starter, 2 bad tasting filets that looked and tasted like they came from the freezer of a gas station and for 24 bucks!!. Chewy calamari and we left at that. Terrible from start to finish",Bad,,Good
"We ate here on our last morning, very good breakfast and not that expensive compared with others. 
Great food, big portions, too big really and service was very good, coffee pot was never empty and good overall atmosphere.",Good,Good,Good
We visited on the first morning of our stay. We hadn't booked a table but we were seated within 10 mins. I asked how many pancakes were in a full stack and how many in a short stack. The waiter told us it was 3 in a full and 2 in a short. I went for the full and WOW. I forgot how big US pancakes were. I couldn't finish my pancakes so my hubby had to help me out. My hubby had the burrito and he said it was lovely.  I had a fruit smoothie and my hubbybhad a tea. Would recommend to anyone. The whole meal cost us ¬£68.,Good,,Good
"Bad and the hostess was totally lost and she was only talking with their other colleges, she was no sure what Si was doing and did not take care for the customer and we desire to go to another place",,Bad,Bad
"Food was good, great variety on menu for everyone in the family.  I got the chicken parm suggested by Saul!  He was one of the best servers we've ever had and my son took his recommendation on the Cuban and really liked it.  Despite being off the lobby of Ceasars palace,  we got in relatively quickly.  Great ambience and excellent service !",Good,Good,Good
"This is inside Caesars Palace. We came here for brunch. They have both counter/bar service and table service. We had to wait in line for a while to get our table because it was extremely busy. The ambiance of this place felt very inviting which is why we insisted on waiting. The food isn‚Äôt the best. Their breakfast fried potatoes were probably the best thing on our dishes. The pancakes look delicious, but unfortunately aren‚Äôt good at all. We were being helped by two servers. Both were very attentive and friendly.",,Good,Good
"Delicious dinner. All of our meals were fabulous. The tacos poke bowl and wings were on point! Service was excellent as well. Alex was very attentive! He was on top of the water and our drinks, we aren‚Äôt used to this heat. Highly recommend!",Good,Good,Good
"Had an awful experience at Caf√© Americano in Caesars Palace. The service was terrible. We were ignored for 15 minutes before we had to find someone to get the waiter to take our order. After taking the order, he disappeared again and ignored us. When we asked for the bill, he dropped it on the table and never returned. We had to wait another 20-30 minutes to pay by credit card. He even watched me punch in the machine and demanded a tip. Completely disrespectful and disappointing. The food wasn't good either. Not recommend this place!!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
Great portions and very tasty! Good variety and good quick service. Kids meals were a great size even for an 8 and 11 year old!,Good,,Good
These things are so delicious! We tried them the last time we were in Vegas and had to come back for them. The drinks are great as well. I loved my passion fruit mojito. Go early in the afternoon and grab a seat at the bar to avoid the crowds.,Good,,
"Really great breakfast, with lots of choices and all with high quality ingredients cooked very well. Emily looked after us most mornings a she is a star and credit to the cafe. Highly recommend.  Tip outside terrace is very nice with warmth in the shade. Inside is very nice but air con is too cold for us.  Great place üëç",Good,,Good
"Very good drinks,  John is a magician with the margaritas and the old fashioned, and easy on the eyes, my husband and I were impressed!",Good,,Good
"For a nice enjoyable sit down breakfast within Caesars Palace out favor go to place is Cafe Americano for the American breakfast of eggs, potatos, bacon or sausage,  sour dough bread and excellent coffee.",Good,Good,
"Bit pricey. Food was consistent. Excellent crispy fried potatoes and enjoyed the strawberry jam the most. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday mornings we were blessed with Danielle. Her wonderful customer service helped us to overlook the prices. Danielle was attentive, hardworking, efficient, and very kind. I would go back to Cafe Americano just to see Danielle. Thank you David for moving us to Danielle‚Äôs area. Your willingness to quickly clean a space and your smile also added to our experience. Megan and Ada helped to quickly seat us and never had to wait in line for very long.",Good,Good,Good
"Cliff was AMAZING. Hands down the best experience I‚Äôve ever had with someone in the service industry. He is personable, funny, and professional. Thanks for the coffee!",,Good,Good
The food was amazing! It was large enough to share . It has a nice bar area as well and inside and outside seating. Customer service was great as well.,Good,Good,Good
"I had a side salad and a chicken la brasa bowl. Both were very good in unexpected ways. The wait staff and manager staff were fantastic. I had a glass of wine that I didn't like  and the manager took care of it. I did eat an early dinner so it wasn't busy, food and drinks were delivered very quickly.",Good,Good,Good
Saul was a great waiter. We highly recommend coming here. Will definitely come back. Thanks Saul for an awesome time!!!,,Good,Good
The food was absolutely on point environment great and staff was very friendly. Answered the right questions and asked the right questions.,Good,Good,Good
"Bar tender junior waited on four other people after I sat down it was 4 different people I sat there for 14 mins waiting and he never came to take my order worst service ever
Plus he walked by me three time never looked at me to see what I wanted to order",,,Bad
Alex was amazing and very attentive and even gave us great recommendations for food and stuff to do on our trip. I would recommend them!,Good,,Good
We had a great experience at Cafe Americano. Our order was missed somehow and we waited for an hour until the manager Edwin came to our rescue. He made sure we were well take care for and checked up on us. The customer service is pretty good and staff is friendly,,Good,Good
"Not sure what we did wrong to not experience any of the positive food reviews that preceded us at Stanton but this may be the hands down worst steakhouse we have ever dined at.


I‚Äôll start with the positive: the restaurant decor is very inviting and beautiful. That is about where the positives end. 


Pay attention to the reviews that comment on slow and inaccurate service because there is a very high probability, that is what you will experience.  The restaurant was empty when we dined here (not a good sign for a Friday night) and yet, it still took a very long time to get our drinks and orders.  Our waiter seemed frazzled every time he came to our table even though he only had two tables to service.


For the rest of this review, keep in mind that this is a SUPER EXPENSIVE restaurant by any steakhouse standard where the steaks are each roughly $100+ and apps can be anywhere from $18 - $30+.


We started with an order of blue point oysters but they wouldn‚Äôt allow us to order a quantity different than increments of a half dozen.  It didn‚Äôt really work for the number of people in our party eating oysters but whatever - we ordered more than we wanted but it got me thinking - what type of high end steakhouse does this?  We asked to split the oysters between two ends of the table where the oyster-eating patrons were sitting.  Couldn‚Äôt pull this off either. Oysters came out with a dozen on one end of the table and a half dozen on the other??..  Was it too difficult for the chef to count out nine oysters on each plate?


No problem - we move on from the oyster debacle.  Most of us in our party ordered steak for an entree but one of our friends ordered scallops (mind you it was $90 for three tiny scallops - she went home hungry).  None of the steaks were cooked properly and the waiter got all of our side dishes wrong.  Should have seen this one coming also as he kept visually counting the seats in our party before each person ordered which is completely fine but it didn‚Äôt seem to serve him well because he botched the whole order.  Remember - this restaurant was empty and our waiter had two tables he was serving.  No apology for bringing us dishes we didn‚Äôt order and no offer to bring us what we actually did order.


My steak was so grizzled and tough, I couldn‚Äôt cut it with the dull steak knife they gave me.  Note to high end steakhouses who wish to charge $150+ per plate - please don‚Äôt serve a steak with a dull steak knife!  None of our party could cut their steaks.  I tried multiple angles to cut this thing and no go.  I also never got my side dish of shoe string truffle fries so I ended up returning the $110 steak and going home hungry.


Needless to say, you can do MUCH BETTER THAN THIS EMPTY WANNABE HIGH END STEAKHOUSE.  Places like Outback and Ruth‚Äôs Chris‚Äôs come to mind as far superior discount fare and for really high end restaurants, pretty much any other place will do.  Don‚Äôt waste your time or money at this place.",Bad,Good,Bad
My husband and I were looking for a place to eat and were happy we found Cafe Americano! Saul had a great personality was a great server! He made great recommendations and the food was hot fresh and tasty. We got the Cuban and Fish and Chips. We plan to come back while we‚Äôre in Vegas!,Good,Good,Good
"VIDA  ESTILO Hospitality Group


ABUSIVE EXPERIENCE
I am requesting a full refund for a spoiled dinner experience when your manager called security agents to kick us out of the restaurant. 


HIGHLY OFFENSIVE and AGGRESSIVE response from your manager only because we claimed for a credit card receipt‚Ä¶ which is our legal right.",,Bad,Bad
"Saul was amazing..he took very good of us. We had a friend that had a seafood allergy and Saul fight over the manager from the kitchen to make sure everything was okay. We were also able to talk to the bartender name Tate, and he was able to explain to us the drinks


Saul was very interactive and compliments. He provided us with things on the menu that he enjoy, you also made us laugh. Would definitely recommend coming back just to see him.",,Good,Good
He was amazing!! Saul was a great server and greeter can‚Äôt wait to come back and have another great time with great ppl!! TY,,Good,Good
"Too bad i was not able to eat here, kitchen service was horrendous, people came in after me and were seated and fed, waited over 1/2 hour never got food. Feel sorry for the wait person she was very apologetic and not responsible for how the kitchen works -- the manager on the other hand needs to learn customer service.",,Bad,Bad
Our first visit to Stanton Social and it was impressive. We reserved the ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù table for our grandkids 21st birthday celebration. The service was nothing short of stellar. There were 8 of us and I heard not a single complaint.,,Good,Good
"Saul was super sweet as he waited on us!! Definitely a warm inviting character! 


The environment of the Cafe is reeeaaallly groovy. Playing our favorite millennial tunes while enjoying spacious dining area with an option for outdoor dining in warmer months. Food was great!",Good,Good,Good
"I am very torn about our visit to Stanton Social Prime.  The thing to understand going in is that the price is very high.  This is a great place for a business dinner, especially with an expense account.


The Good:  Love the room it has a unique and fun feel.  Definitely has an ""Instagram"" feel to it.  When I first came in, I thought it would be loud, it did not turn out that way.  The food was excellent.  Really enjoyed everything that we ate.  We made the decision to only share apps and sides since they sounded the best.  Yellowtail crudo, soup dumplings, meatballs, and potato puree all excellent.  I would skip the cheesesteak sliders and brussel sprouts, both lacked flavor.  


Not as good:  The price was very high for everything.  This was especially true for the drinks.  The concept that they have for the cocktails is interesting, but at $22-$25, cocktails were just not good enough.  Food is also expensive, but probably more worth it.  


A note on service:  Possibly an off night, but our waiter felt like he was kind of annoyed that we were there, or perhaps that we ordered more tapas style, but just did not want to help us much.  Additionally, the host stand is outside the restaurant, so when we arrived for our reservation, we had to wait 10 minutes.  This involved us basically standing awkwardly in the casino waiting to be sat.",,Good,Bad
"Good! Stand outs from dinner included the shrimp cocktail and the yellow tail al pastor for appetizers, pretty in pink steak for entrees, brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes for sides and the chocolate peanut butter cake for dessert. Beef carpaccio was so so. We ordered the strawberry milk shake dessert which was fun to cut into, but the chocolate cake was better. If you‚Äôre looking for a quiet dinner, pass on this place as it‚Äôs very loud due to music inside. It‚Äôs a great place for groups because apps and sides are large enough to share.",Good,Bad,
Excellent customer service. Ricardo was an outstanding server! He was personable and attentive and was genuinely interested in making sure we were happy with our breakfast. Shout out to Scott the floor manager. He was outstanding as well!,,,Good
"We both ordered the chopped salad. It was a little pricey for a salad, but on par for the area. The salad was good and quite filling.",Good,,
"Stopped here for a bite before checking in as we were a little early. The food was ok, had wings, a salad and pizza, it was just ok not bad but nothing to get excited about. As with just about every restaurant we tried, around the strip and downtown. the servers seem very unhappy and like they are doing you a favor by waiting on you to eat average food at outrageous prices.",Good,,Bad
"What would have normally been a fine lunch experience turned into a top notch dining experience thanks to my server, Fernando! Yes, the food was delicious and my blueberry martini was divine, but it was his outstanding, personable service that brought me here to leave this review. Outstanding servers elevate any dining experience and Fernando raises the bar to another level entirely! Thank you!",Good,Good,Good
"I stayed 4 days at Caesar's Palace and I dined at the Stanton Social Prime bar 3 out of the 4 nights.  First night-- Seared Scallops and Loaded Potato Puree (yummy). Second Night--Pretty in Pink Filet and Lobster Mac & Cheese (bartenders Jacob and Anthony did not steer me wrong...both items were absolutely wonderful).  Third night --The Movie Theater Sundae (sooo good-- recommended by female bartender...sorry,  I forgot your name).  Every night I also had The Lady Elettaria (a lemon drop like cocktail with boba pearls...refreshing and delightful)!


I'll be back to Stanton Social Prime.",Good,Good,Good
Delicious food. I tried the poke bowl and was satisfied with the dish. The Saul was great!  He made nice recommendations and took good care of us.,Good,,Good

The bar staff rocked‚Ä¶..
Kristina & Chantel took excellent care of me. Good & menu options.",Good,Good,Good
What a treat! American standards done perfectly. Great cocktails and tasty food. Our server Fernando took terrific care of us and Patrick backed him up to make sure our experience was perfect.,Good,Good,Good
"Interesting mix of small plates and main dishes. Everything was delicious.  Several steak options.  Not many main dishes for non-meat eaters, but many of the small plates were vegetarian.  Interesting twists on classic cocktails.  Lots of things were smoked, which are dramatic.  Service inside was wonderful (front desk staff were a little unfriendly).",Good,,Good
"I wish I had found this place before I had to leave.  My wife and I were roaming around the hotel and came across this place that had a huge line out the door.  We figured it must be good and it was.  The line was very quick, so don't turn around and leave.  The food and service were both excellent and the prices were very reasonable.  Great atmosphere and I can't say enough about this place.  Just go!",Good,Good,Good
"The food is excellent at this restaurant. The service left a little to be desired, our server was quite opininated on how we should order our food. If we are paying for a premium for a burger please let us order it as we desire. Server was slow on the bill and struggled to perform a basic room charge for our bill. I didnt like how the server hovered over me when filling out the room charge bill.",Good,,Bad
"My waiter Alex went way above and beyond during my visit, getting the kitchen to make a side for me that I really wanted, being incredibly attentive but not intrusive, and generally making my experience truly 5 stars. He is a very professional and personable guy that added to the experience in a very positive way and really went above and beyond. I'll be back!


the food was far better than I expected at a reasonable price. I couldn't be happier.",Good,Good,Good
"I had the pleasure of dining here three times while in town for CES.  Each time, the staff was incredibly friendly and efficient.  From greeting to water, drink refills, checking in etc, was terrific.  Today my server was Eric and he was awesome. 
P.S. Great food, too!",Good,Good,Good
Saul took very good care of us and food was delicious!  Food came out in a very timely manner. All staff were very friendly and we will be back!,Good,Good,Good
"We had an early New Year's Eve dinner at Stantons. From the very first, it was a great experience. The decor, while a little, too masculine for my taste, was beautiful. Our waiter Carlos was very attentive. He was knowledgeable describing items on the menu and answering questions. He seemed to appear when you needed him, but we never felt rushed. Because it was New Year's Eve, there was a choice between a New Year's Eve menu or the regular menu. The selections made it difficult to choose!   We Shared the onion soup dumplings, which were amazing! Highly recommended. Also sampled the pierogies, crab cake corndogs and the sea bass. We would happily have all of them again, but also want to try several other items on the menu. In addition, cocktails were delicious. The wine list offered great choices, both by the glass and by the bottle.  To top it off, even the music in the background added to the experience. I would highly recommend Stanton social prime for an all-around excellent dining experience.",Good,Good,Good
"Each time we're in Vegas Cafe Americano never disappoints! Yeh, it's a bit pricey,  but hey that's Vegas Baby!!


Food is always great and the service is outstanding.",Good,Good,Good
"Went there for breakfast. Server was Raul. Ordered short stack pancakes and the American breakfast. Asked for jam which never came. Eggs over easy had runny whites, and when we complained, were given a lesson on egg cooking and Raul insisted that eggs over easy ALWAYS had runny whites. Not true. Ate them anyway as we were hungry and there was no option offered.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Foods are amazing I recommended pasta and shrimps, good place and decoration,  big thanks to Charles very professional and nice person, love Las Vegas ! See u soon",Good,Good,Good
Sat at the bar on Friday night for dinner and drinks. The quinoa bowl is always a go to healthy option for me and my friend and I both continue to like the pizzas. This place is typically busy and is always enjoyable.,Good,Good,
"Sat at the bar for dinner without a reservation on a Thursday night. Drinks and dinner were a delight. Our bartender was fun ,  she made our drinks perfectly. Friday and Saturday were limited reservation times, 8pm and later were the only options. Lucky to sneak a seat. The mushrooms üçÑ though!",Good,Good,Good
Amazing service. Ricardo was immediately available with coffee refills.  Great energy and vibe with music and people,,Good,Good

So. Good. Everything we tried was amazing. Way to go Saul! Good atmosphere and the flavors were fantastic. We will be back.,Good,Good,Good
Waiter Rene always does a great job!  He is very detailed and precise with taking orders and very attentive during the meal.  His energy and communication skills are a great benefit to Cafe Americano.,Good,,Good
"Compared to other places on the strip, for the price, This was basic at best. Food was just ok. Prices for this quality (so,so) is outrageous. 
Drink prices are absurd. Go to elsewhere.",Bad,,
"Oily horrible food ,unfriendly staff , made us wait 40 min in line to an empty restaurant that look like u will be seated in any minute  ,instead of telling us they will let us in only 40 min later when they staff shift will change ???


What a way to run a restaurant üò±, the look warm oily food only arrived 40 min later as well , avoid !!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Good variety of food and drinks to choose from. I ordered the ceviche sliders and quesabirria flautas. Both were delicious, especially the flautas! I wish I can order them all the time. Highly recommend eating at the bar like I did because the line for dining room seating was long. My bartender was great! She immediately gave me a menu and was attentive. However, she had to run back to the kitchen to get everyone‚Äôs food pretty frequently. Hopefully the bar is able to get food runners or more bartenders to cover!",Good,,Good
Service was by far the most lacking I have experienced in any restaurant.  There over an hour and not even the water glass filled. Restaurant was empty while other places couldn't get a reservation because they were busy. Guess time will put this place out of business based on service and seeing lack of folks going there.  Only reason ended up there because couldn't get reservation elsewhere due to my late planning.  Will not be returning.  Too many other places to go,,Bad,Bad
"This is really a great restaurant in the middle of the Las Vegas strip.  The food is really great, overload of carbs and protein - super nice & delicious. Everything in the menu looks good, but it‚Äôs a late breakfast due to regularly long lines of customers.  


The service is ok, but you have to understand the number of tables to serve.  Turnaround serving time is acceptable.  I wonder during peak hours.  


This Resto must be making tons of money each day!",Good,,Good
"We always stay at Paris and have been eating at the Cafe Americano there for 15 years now. This was the first time to eat at the Caesars Palace location. This location supercedes the Paris location in food quality, selection, service and decor! WOW! We will now walk across the street from Paris to eat here at Caesars Palace. Our server Alex was EXCEPTIONAL! He was very professional, kind, knowledgeable and patient.  We only ate a few apps and so the suggested tip at the bottom of the receipt was ridiculous.  His service was well beyond the $9.46 that was suggested and we made sure to let him know that and tipped him well beyond the suggested amount. The atmosphere was incredible. We asked the host if we could sit somewhere that wasn't right next to another table and she was very accommodating. If you ask at Paris they seem to get upset and tell you most of the sections in the restaurant where are closed. I don't understand the EXTREME differences between the two locations but like I said, we will walk across the street from Paris to Caesars to eat at this Cafe Americano location from now on! Hopefully we can sit in Alex's sections well.",Good,Good,Good
"Amazing wings, the bar staff are so friendly, particularly Zo, really made us feel welcome. There was a random girl called Lina that was very rude but don‚Äôt really know what her purpose was!?",Good,,Good

"Jose G our waiter was amazing and it made us come back everyday for breakfast - he was great looked after us so well, it was a bit of peace outside of the chaos of Caesers (Adel weekend)  Jose G was very knowledgeable and so happy it made our day!  Food is good the pancakes are amazing!",Good,Good,Good
"Third time coming here. Better call Saul. His service was excellent. Drinks were always full, food was great.",Good,,Good
"This place is rapidly becoming a hot spot in Las Vegas, so be sure to book in advanced.


Overall, Stanton is another high-end, pricey, casino restaurant. Unlike others, Stanton aims at secluding you from the world with no windows nor ‚Äúterraces‚Äù. Although the place is beautifully and elegantly decorated, at times you might get a hint of claustrophobia. 


The menu is varied but limited, with focus on steaks. The tomahawk is doubtlessly the center piece of the menu, and as everything at Stanton, is presented with Instagram and social media in mind. The food is not exceptional, there are better options, even nearby options, for steaks, pasta, and seafood; even for desserts!!! 


The milkshake-shaped dessert you‚Äôve probably already seen on social media is more appealing to the eye than to the palate. The ‚Äúthing‚Äù is no cupcake, no ice cream, no cookie, no mouse, and no chocolate, but rather a weird mix of all those things. The flavor is extremely sweet with hints of raspberry, and the various textures are unappealing and unpleasant; and is plenty enough for 2 or 3 persons. If you don‚Äôt have your Instagram feed in mind, you better go with another dessert.


The cocktail menu, on the other hand, is exceptional!!! Although the cocktails hint at traditional mixology, they have a creative and modern twist that make them quite enjoyable, and again, worth your Instagram feed. Thumbs up for the Rancho Gloria and the Strawberry Rhode.


Finally, regarding service, it is quite agreeable. From the looks of the place, you would expect service to be a bit pretentious, but it is actually quite the opposite. The waiter and the busboy were very friendly and patient with the taking of the photographs, which surely is not something new to them.


Would I recommend this place??? Well, be true to yourself about what you‚Äôre looking for, an exceptional meal, or an Instagram worth picture.",,Good,Good
"Limited menu. There is not a wide variety of selections for a 24-hour facility. Not a lot of ""traditional American dishes."" The buffet hands down is be a better bang for the buck.",Bad,,
"Good stuff first‚Ä¶This is a tasty and adventurous menu.  Our party of 4 ordered the Carpaccio, French Onion Soup Dumplings, Wagyu Filet, Chicken Parmigiana, and Movie Theater Popcorn Sunday plus drinks and shared all this between the 4 of us since we had a large lunch.  All were perfection.  Now the bad stuff‚Ä¶from our first bottle of still water to the first and second round of drinks and appetizer plates, all these were still on our table by the time we were ready to pay for our check.  We went sometimes 10-15 minutes between times our server stopped by our table.  And lastly, this place is LOUD.  I cannot understate how loud it is.  Be ready for great food and food presentations, but know that you‚Äôll be leaning in and around dishes/cups a lot to talk across the table, and you‚Äôll have to move your own dishes around  to get your next course.",Good,Bad,Bad
"We were really interested in several appetizers and desserts and were worried they wouldn't allow us to order them with no mains but they were really accommodating. We had to have the infamous onion soup dumplings but there were several other apps we wanted too. We loved the ""al pastor"" yellowtail crudo, and would definitely order it again. The soup dumplings were good but the amount of cheese on top is very filling. The crab cake corn dogs were delicious but fairly heavy. The pierogi are to die for in my opinion. My husband did order a main but I was stuffed full from the apps. He had the scallops which were cooked perfectly and the dish as a whole was amazing. I knew I wanted the movie theater sundae before we even went in. It was huge! We saw pieces of cake being served around us and they were enormous too. The sundae was delicious, salty, sweet, crunchy, soft. I would definitely order it again but between the two of us, I don't even think we made a very big dent in it. Overall this restaurant was very good and we will return. The servers were pretty fabulous too. Every staff member we interacted with was very personable and really helped us enjoy our experience.",Good,Good,Good
"I love a good steakhouse and this did not disappoint!


Easy to make a reservation online. The interior is cozy and swanky.


Excellent service. We started at the bar with a cocktail before moving to our table. Unique cocktails with great presentation.


The menu has all the classic with a fun twist and unique items- we had to try most :)


We started with the crab cake corn dogs. Think crab cakes in corn dog batter and fried like a corn dog- yum!


Next we had the french onion soup dumplings- great presentation and taste. Would def order again.


For the main course I had the petite sirloin which was delicious and cooked to perfection. I did order a sauce on the side but the steak was so good, I didn't end up not touching the sauce.


Sides we shared family style. the patatas bravas, cooked in duck fat and so tasty.


The maple brussel sprouts were good!


And the crispy eggplant- yum!


We made sure to save room for dessert. The movie theatre sundae. Which was a sundae served in a popcorn looking bag and topped with popcorn! It. was. delicious!


Can't wait to return, and order all the same things.",Good,Good,Good
We randomly picked this location for a fast dinner and to watch the football game and it was the best end to our day! Saul was so personable and gave us great recommendations for food! We each got one of the entrees he recommended plus a drink! It was a nice atmosphere and perfect for people watching! I would 10/10 recommend!,Good,Good,Good
"I enjoyed one of the best dinners I've ever had here!! The decor was luxe and rich with dim lighting and lots of velvet. The service was impeccable, our waitress was attentive and offered suggestions on the menu which were all outstanding. The menu is innovative and I wish I could have tried at least 4 or 5 more dishes. The french onion dumplings were OUTSTANDING, and the Strawberry 'Milkshake' was one of the most creative desserts I've ever enjoyed. The cocktails were incredible as well, and worth the price. Highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Vegas!!",Good,Good,Good
"We had a wonderful experience when we were at the Paris hotel.  The service was terrific and we wanted to specifically recognize Sandy, the Manager as well as Mr. Beltran that took care of me and my colleagues.  The food was good, but the sincere care that we received from the staff was memorable.  I did run into a hiccup where I asked for my receipt to be emailed. When I realized that I didn't receive it, I came back the next day where they took care of us quickly :) Thank you Sandy and Mr. Beltran!",Good,Good,Good
This is a great spot for Mexican American cuisine. Affordable and excellent staff. Absolutely would visit again. Ask for Saul!,Good,Good,Good
"LATE NIGHT REVIEW.  Came here late Sunday night/Monday morning‚Äîmust have been right when Omnia nightclub let out because there were lots of drunk people at the bar causing loud commotion.  We got seated near the bar but had to ask to be moved to the opposite side of the restaurant since the drunk people were so inconsiderately loud‚Äîand management did nothing about it.


Food was meh.  The Crispy Chicken Tenders was not good‚Äînot that crispy and overall tasted like food I could get at a gas station.  The Carne Asada Breakfast Burrito was just okay, the house potato side was good though.  This place is open 24/7 so that‚Äôs a huge plus if you‚Äôre hungry, but don‚Äôt expect much.

"My wife and I have an upcoming Caesars Seven Stars trip and we always make the dinner reservations for each night ahead of time. We had one for Stanton Social. Out of the blue we get a ""Reservation Cancelled"" notice....no reason given....no explanation given....no alternate times given....just CANCELLED! This is not a good sign for this restaurant nor is it a good way to run a business. There's definitely a lack of communication with this group. Based on some reviews and this sudden notice, maybe it's a sign. We've moved on. Vegas has waaaaayyyyy too many choices for dining to treat a customer in this fashion. We're truly disappointed.",,Bad,Bad

"HORRIBLE!!! Very busy and understaffed and i understand that...Took about 40 minutes to sit us even though it was mostly empty. Took another 15 minutes to get a drink and when i ordered the server said they were out of that item. I asked her to give me 2 more minutes to find something else, she finally came back 15 minutes later and was in a hurry and wanted me to order fast and i tried but she was obviously annoyed. After my order i waited patiently for a drink refill, my wife tried to get her attention for a refill and the server just waved her hand as if to say don't bother me right now...She did not say anything but waved her hand NO!!! Needless to say, i left a 5-dollar bill and walked out with no food and almost 90 minutes in this place. Short staffed should not replace human decency and we dine out several times a week and this was by far the worse experience we have ever had.",,Bad,Bad

"Food was ok.  My sister and I (both seniors) wanted a small dinner prior to a show at Caesars Palace.  I had the poke bowl and brioche bread ($29.52 including the tip) and my sister had fries and calamari.  Her dinner was overpriced.  We were a bit early for the dinner crowd so we did not have to wait to be seated.  The service (Fernando) was excellent...however the atmosphere was a disaster.  The music, which was meant to supply background ambiance, was too loud and inappropriate for dining.  We commented on the noise level but nothing was done about it.  I have written many reviews and maybe 2 or 3 of them were to share a negative experience.  Perhaps this is what is needed to have management address the noisy ""music"".  The location is excellent and well placed for the type of meal we wanted.  Just attend to a few dining details...check your prices and your sound selection and level.",,Bad,Good
Stopped by for a quick bite before check in. Great food amazing service! Highly recommend stopping in!,Good,,Good
"My girlfriend and I had an excellent time here at cafe Americano. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. Ricardo was an excellent waiter, attentive and made us laugh. Scott, the floor manager was also very kind. Food was good, although they were out of flautas, they made it up to us with complimentary mimoas.  I would recommend this place 100%.",Good,Good,Good
Ricardo was an amazing server! So friendly and prompt! The food was delicious. Scott the floor manager was friendly and attentive. Great lunch!,Good,Good,Good
"Food was meh but ultra expensive.  $89 filet. ???  House red wine was $25/glass but it was a 5 oz pour of a $36 bottle of wine.  A $25 old fashioned should be a wow.  Nothing special here.  Won't return as there's much better options - Heritage, Primal, One to name three off the top of my head.  Very overpriced for what it is.",Bad,,
"While staying at Caesars Palace, decided to try Caf√© Americano. It is located right off the hotel lobby. They are open 24 HRS. 


Restaurant to quite large. To the left is the bar and to the right is tables and booths. They also have outdoor seating. 


Upon entering, I was immediately seated. I came at a quiet time. It took some time for the waitress to arrive. The menu has an extensive list of items ‚Äì burgers, sliders, sandwiches, nachos, salads, etc‚Ä¶ Basically normal food at a restaurant. Within 10 minutes of placing my order, I was served. The food that I ordered was good, but found the meat was undercooked. The meat should have been cooked a little more. But I must say, it was flavorful and the sides were excellent. 


It is very pricey for just having something simple. $24 for the lunch, $6 for a soda. I can tell you that it is less expensive than other restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip. I will go back and try a different item on the menu.",Good,Good,
Excellent food and top flight service - a great addition to the first rate dining scene that bespeaks Caesars - while just off the casino floor it is quiet and tranquil - you wouldn‚Äôt know you‚Äôre in a casino,Good,Good,Good
"I had dinner with my friends last night at Stanton Social Prime. We were so excited to try it. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and the service was great, but unfortunately it was some of the worst food I‚Äôve ever eaten. The French onion soup dumplings were just ok at best. The chicken parmigiana was inedible - tough, cold, and just tasted bad. The lobster mac and cheese was also awful. The butter mashed potatoes however were good. They are definitely on the expensive side and the food in no way justifies the price they charge.",Bad,Good,Good
"Open 24hrs, so it's very convenient.  Daughter and I both got Denver omelettes.  It was okay,  but the country potatoes was really nicely seasoned. Wife got the chimichurri skirt steak. She thought it was bland, but I sampled a piece and thought it was fine.  Nephew enjoyed his half stack of pancakes. Four entrees,  1 bloody mary and 1 orange juice came out to just under $160. Very pricy, but its Vegas. Our server didn't seem to want to be at work. Then again he was much nicer to the table next to us. Was it because we had kids with us? Or because we are Asian? Or maybe something else...who knows.",Good,,Bad

"The folks that work at Cafe Americano deserve a raise!  We always go to the bar for breakfast and a nightcap.  The bar employees are friendly and accommodating. Always a smile and a desire to provide the best service.  We see the same people working behind the bar year after year and they work so well together, other restaurants should stop by and take a lesson on customer service from these folks.  My wife and I can't say enough good about the food, service and drinks at the 24 hour restaurant.   BTW, the portions are so large you should plan on splitting.",Good,Good,Good
"Excellent for meals while at Caesars 
Richardo  is an excellent waiter. Also the bar is also a great place to grab a drink and many excellent staff in the bar aswell Anthony Tate and Patrick will look after you well",Good,Good,Good
We were staying at Nobu Hotel within Caesar‚Äôs Palace and wound up having dinner and breakfast here. The menu has a great selection and the prices are very reasonable compared to other similar restaurants in the area. My husband absolutely loved the pork chop recommended by our waiter. Service was friendly and prompt and the restaurant is open 24 hours. I would have been happy eating here for every meal during our stay. Highly recommend.,Good,Good,Good
"Great music, amazing food, and our server Emilee was INCREDIBLE. So sweet and brought me out sauces I never thought of. She went out of her way to bring me sauces with no dairy when I didn‚Äôt even ask! Will definitely come back",Good,Good,Good
"We were here on vacation & we ate here multiple times! The service was quick & the waitstaff were super nice & accommodating to our every need!  Every single time!  So much so we ask to speak to the manager to rave about the great employees. The teamwork they displayed was great, I realize how hard it is to get & keep employees, so this group is/was special. Thank you to Chantel, Kristina & Jose, love how you work together with a smile on your faces!",,Good,Good
Dave was absolutely amazing!!! Great customer service and best late night wing ever!!!  He really took care for me as far as making sure i got exactly what i needed.,Good,Good,Good
"Hands down the worst meal since being to Vegas for work. 20+ min to pour Prosecco in a glass. 35+ min to get food, and it was sitting for awhile. We tried to cancel but the food magically arrived. My friend‚Äôs pasta was cold and the cheese congealed, my rigatoni cheese was burned like sitting by a heat lamp too long. I wasn‚Äôt even hungry at that point. My friend cancelled her order when her shrimp linguini has 4 shrimp for a $12 up charge. I paid and even tipped because I‚Äôm a fool. I am so upset with myself for allowing this establishment to do this. They didn‚Äôt even apologize to me because I didn‚Äôt raise hell like my friend. Didn‚Äôt even make an effort to make it right. Disgusted.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Amazing service‚Ä¶ bloody Mary‚Äôs to die for great start to a big day in vegas.. great place to visit in the sun.. Mikey is great sever he‚Äôs the boy,Good,Good,Good
"First visit to Caesars and we were well looked after by Mikey at the bar. He made some beer recommendations and let me have a sample before making my choice.


The guys put the UK football on the bar screens and made us feel very welcome.


Thanks for the great service and we will be back.",Good,Good,Good
"Service got off to a slow start ( outside bar, seams to have been a language barrier), food wasn‚Äôt the greatest, veggies were old and past the point of acceptable. I would however recommend the Strawberry Lemonade Mock-tail it was the most enjoyable portion of my overall experience",Good,Bad,Bad
"My husband and I spent our 11th anniversary at Stanton Social and they made us feel so special. When we arrived, our server, Sabrina, congratulated us on our anniversary and gave us complimentary champagne. The food was phenomenal, and Sabrina was amazing the whole evening. At the end of our meal, she brought us a complimentary slice of cake. The whole evening was unforgettable and made me feel so special. Thank you to Sabrina and the whole staff at Stanton Social for making us feel so amazing on our anniversary.",Good,Good,Good
Sol was a fanastic server! Recommended the best meals and took great care of us. Ask for him when you go!,Good,,Good
It was a very good dinner the food was great! The service was very good and the vibe of the restaurant was nice!!,Good,Good,Good
We stop by this restaurant in Caesars Palace this afternoon. Our Server was very personable. He shared his top 4 picks on the menu. We order 2 of the 4 dishes and they were phenomenal!!! The first was the Cuban and second was the Brisket Dip. Both dishes were to die for! The ambiance in the restaurant was awesome as well. Would advise stopping in if you are ever in Las Vegas. You will not be disappointed!!,Good,Good,Good
"We stopped in for dinner our last night in Vegas, our server Saul came over to the table and wow what a difference he made in our experience there. He gave us recommendations and he was not wrong! So impressed by the food and his attitude made our night! We ate at many high end restaurants there at Caesars and this restaurant was the best! Pork Chops and Ribs were awesome! Ask for Saul!",Good,Good,Good
"First, let me qualify myself for this review, I have been in the gourmet business for over 30 years. I have eaten at some of the most famous restaurants in the country. Though I really liked most of them, it was usually the quality of the food that I enjoyed.
The Stanton Social Prime Restaurant is different. The offerings are all new creations of someone the best plates you can find.
One of the best aspects of this restaurant is the idea that most, if not all, the items are designed to be shared. They will split everything from their shrimp cocktail to a steak.
We started with some oysters which came with 3 sauces. The best one was their proprietary ""slushy"" tart sauce. Delicious and if gave the oysters a whole new perspective. Then they brought us a bread and butter plate when the butter was covered with a bell of warm smoke. That made the bread and butter far better than any I have ever had at any other restaurant.
Following came the talk of the restaurant,  a crab cake corn dog! I first thought it was something else, but they showed up looking just like traditional corn dogs. They were delicious. A greater way to serve crabcakes. 
For our main course, we split the filet and the scallops. The scallops came on a bed of the best orzo I have ever had. My wife and I fought over it. Amazing!!
After that we tried our friends' pierogies. Never had pierogies as got as those.
All of a sudden, we looked up, and the founder, owner, and chef, Chris Santos, came up to our table to see how we were doing. Chris said the restaurant had only been open for a week, and he wanted to stay and make certain things were going well.
Chris thanked us for our patronage and then sent us a huge slice of Key Lime pie.
The food is some of the most innovative and best tasting I have ever had.
The ambiance is phenomenal, the waiters treat you like they were there solely for you.
You just can't do better then this....",Good,Good,Good
Staying at Paris hotel we went for dinner ! Long line to be seated ! Waited abt 10 minutes ! Sat outside restaurant in casino area ! Menu lots of choices even vegan ! Server not that helpful or friendly ! To me over rated and expensive would not visit again,,Bad,Bad
Our server Cliff is basically the best. Great food recommendations and some of the menu tips. Will definitely be back!,Good,Good,Good
"Food is soooo great, like everything else in Las Vegas it obscenely expensive but unlike the rest of Vegas this is actually worth it.  Even just for Charles the floor manager.  He is a wonderful human.",Good,,Good
We stayed at Paris and it was so amazing. The boys both have a nut allergy and Cafe Americano took it very seriously. Both boys had Belgium waffles and they were delicious. We came back later for a late night snack. We loved how it's open 24/7.,Good,Good,Good
First morning In Vegas and came here for breakfast. Service was really good and the breakfast was too. Was pricey but worth it.,Good,,Good
Great service. Food was on point! Wait was a little long but it was bad timing on our part. Our server Danielle was awesome!,Good,,Good
"This is my GO TO restaurant whenever I‚Äôm in Las Vegas‚Ä¶ Everything about this restaurant is GREAT! It‚Äôs opened 24 hours and they have a very nice selection of food‚Ä¶ /The atmosphere , service and quality of food is also GREAT!
  THIS RESTAURANT / CAFE IS EXCELLENT!",Good,Good,Good
"Breakfast my first day was great. Nice staff, friendly. Good. Today bar tender was a complete jerk to me. I waited 20 minutes while talking to other customers while he ignored me. I asked nicely if I could order some fries to go and he acted super angry and aggressive. I finally didn‚Äôt  order anything and went to my room. Crummy experience and really bizarre behavior from the bar tender. Would not go again. Also super over priced.",,Bad,
"My wife and I visited Las  Vegas over the Christmas holiday.  We stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Palace from 24 Dec through the 28th.  


From our first morning meal through several lunches and dinners, the food was consistently well prepared, presented, and delicious every time.   The portion sizes were pleasantly appropriate and easily shareable, if needed, while offering great value for the price.  Even the coffee was superior to what most restaurants offer such that we skipped the Starbucks and went right to Cafe Americano!


While this restaurant wouldn‚Äôt be considered one of the ‚Äòspecialty‚Äô ones located with in the Caesar‚Äôs Palace resort, in our view, it deserves to stand with the others as a very high quality eatery for your consideration.  


Additionally, every one of the wait staff members greeted, and treated, us as if we were the most important customer in the restaurant.  


My wife, who is a picky eater, was extremely impressed by the quality of all her meal choices.  From my view, Cafe Americano deserves the highest praise, and your consideration, as a great place to eat while staying in, and around, the middle of the Strip.",Good,Good,Good
"Attended Conference at Caesar‚Äôs Palace in Las Vegas. Frequented Cafe Americano for suppers on two nights. Food was delicious. Our server, Alex, was attentive and helpful with suggestions. Also accommodated us to split entrees, which are very generous.",Good,Good,Good
"Excellent waitstaff! Alex was my waiter tonight, he made sure I was well taken care of. Thank you Alex. My food was cooked to order and tasted amazing.",Good,Good,Good
"Had brunch there (in Caesar's).  Chose the bagel platter which had plenty of smoked salmon, four mini-bagels, and other accompaniments.   If not super hungry, may want to split and get some additional side such as fruit.",Good,,
"soup was good, the cheese on the quesadilla was cold. The apple Chris was cold not hot. Very disappointing in Cesar palace going back to the Venetian.",Bad,Bad,
Saul was amazing and recommended the best food. His service was 10/10 and was always there before we needed anything.,Good,Good,Good
"Last weekend we stayed at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. We were definitely ready for an early breakfast so we called for room service (which we were told was available when we checked in). Nope - no room service. Try 2, we went down to the front desk at Caesars and asked for a breakfast option and they pointed us to Caffe Americano as the only option in their entire property - including the food hall.


We decided to give it a try and were met with a very frosty hostess who was not excited about seating anyone who did not have the Diamond Status. There were four of us - a couple in front of us and my husband and myself - waiting a LONG time to just get seated. Then our two tables might as well have been on Mars since it took a long while to get menus, water, etc.


When we did place our order and receive our food, it was good but not great, and absolutely not worth what we paid. 


Considering that Caesars is a ""brand"" and that the Caffe Americano sign still says 24/7 - which it is definitely not - I think they could and should want to do better. I honestly wish I would have just stuck with the granola bar in my travel bag.",,Bad,Bad
"Regardless of where we stay, we always make our way to Cafe Americano.  Fabulous eggs benedict, pancakes, omelets  fresh orange juice and Good!",Good,Good,Good
"Odd name it starts with: ‚ÄúCafe‚Äù.  You expect something a little quieter than the bustle of the casino floor.  Instead some DJ is pumping unknown songs at high volume over your meal.  Then everyone starts having to talk louder until you need earplugs.  it‚Äôs 75 decibels in this ‚Äúcafe‚Äù.  Impossible to control children who thinks it‚Äôs circus.  Food?  OK for takeout as we asked for it go in order to talk!


If you still go, the ONLY option recommended is their outdoor section if it‚Äôs open. Music free from the mayhem inside.",Good,Bad,
"Had breakfast here‚Ä¶food and coffee comes out hot and fresh. Tried the crab omelette with potatoes and a pancake. Pancake was lite, fluffy, and did I mention HOT!! Great final breakfast to wrap up our Vegas visit. This place is located in the Paris hotel. The decor was beautiful like eating at a cute sidewalk cafe but indoors away from traffic and birds.",Good,Good,
Saul was great! We had to wait a bit for our food but he kept checking on us. It was worth the wait!,Good,,Good
"Had dinner, and right off the bat the service was absolutely amazing. Our server was Saul and he took care of everything quickly, easily, with an excellent attitude and witty banter! The food was delicious, had the fish tacos and the nachos, fish was perfectly cooked and fluffy, nachos was flavorful and wonderful!",Good,,Good
"Amazing service, wonderful atmosphere, great music selection. Our server/waiter Saul is awesome. Never was a dull moment. Very very professional,very straight forward with what is his personal favorite. They were hitting very impressed. So ask for him when you visit. He earned his tip for sure",,Good,Good
"We recently attended a conference in Caesar‚Äôs Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada and decided to try Cafe Americano for breakfast. We were really disappointed at not only the service but especially the food. I ordered steak and eggs cooked over medium, plus coffee and my friend ordered the breakfast sandwich with Bloody Mary. When the food arrived, it looked fine at first glance, however, when I started to slice my steak, it was rubbery  and chewy which means that it was overcooked.  I ordered medium well because that is the perfect way I like my steak cooked, however, the cook decided to cook it well done. When I started eating the eggs, it was still runny and seems that my over medium was actually cooked OVER RUNNY with the whites still runny all over my plate. I was waiting for the server to come back to tell him what happened to our orders but he never showed back up to even ask how was our food or if we needed more coffee or anything. The server never even ask us for any refills. He came back when we almost were done eating and brought up the Check. I said something about how my food was over cooked for the steak and undercooked for the eggs. I also complained about the coffee not getting a refill and my companion complained about the Bloody Mary not tasting any better. All in all, I would give this place a grade of F for failing on customer service 101, Customer satisfaction 101, and being a server. He never even came back to check on us and our situation. I will never eat in this restaurant again when in Vegas, and I WILL NOT recommend this restaurant.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This restaurant is open 24 hours.  The prices are typical Vegas prices. The menu has several breakfast dishes, several entrees, sandwiches, salads, and pizzas.  The pizzas are amazing, and everything else was very good.  The service was friendly, quick, and competent.",Good,Good,Good
"Our server, Saul was so pleasant and helpful with the menu, he made our dinner very enjoyable. Such a great personality! The manager,Charles ensured everything was perfect. Fabulous Manhattan! Great food. We‚Äôll be back.",Good,Good,Good
Saul from Cafe Americano was the best! Attention to detail and suggestions of food item were spot on!,Good,,Good
"Great Service! Very attentive and the food was Amazing !!
Love it and will for sure be coming back for dessert!
Would for sure recommend",Good,Good,Good
Friendly server and a tasty sandwich in an informal setting. A good spot to wait out my room availability.,Good,Good,Good
"Alex at cafe Americana! And the fried chicken OMG!  They talk about Vegas food, but this was over the top and  the sweet potatoes with the Colby cheese was amazing.  The fried chicken was crunchy with a honey flavor but not overpowering.  It was perfect! And the price, they could have changed twice the amount and I would have gladly paid it after eating it.  It was just delicious!.  The wives shared a ginormous piece of unbelievable chocolate cake.  I had a little, it was super moist and you could tell they didn‚Äôt cut any corners making it.  And Jimmy had the crab bisque which was more crab than bisque and a crab omelette for his entree and he was raving.  Again the omelette was more crab than omelette.  The Cafe Americano is an amazing value for what you get for the price!  I highly recommend it.  We made a reservation and didn‚Äôt have to wait at all.  And Jon at the bar was a super cool bartender.  My phone was out of juice and he charged it for me while I had a drink.  Good place, down to earth, all around great staff!, they are working hard and I‚Äôm really happy I ate there!  You need to try it!",Good,Good,Good
"Staying in the Paris walk past a few times, today stoped for breakfast. Unlike other places I‚Äôve eaten where the poached eggs are serve swimming in water and overcooked or more Likely  kept warm. The eggs are cooked fresh and yolks are perfect. Pity it‚Äôs our last day tomorrow.",Good,,
"Do yourself a favor if you‚Äôre staying at Caesars Palace and have some breakfast here (In all honesty we had lunch our first day here too - which was also amazing)!  First start off with a flight of mimosas - my SO also enjoyed a Bellini.  I loved the pomegranate raspberry mimosa.  For breakfast, I enjoyed the Bacon Egg and Avocado sandwich(es) - it‚Äôs delicious and HUGE!  My SO enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros which was served on a crispy not soft tortilla.  The service with Rene was impeccable- friendly and fast!


Lunch was delish too‚Ä¶I enjoyed the turkey sandwich and my SO enjoyed the steak and cheese - both FANTASTIC!


Make sure to dine here!",Good,,Good
Alex was great. Friendly and fast service before the show. Drinks were delicious. Atmosphere was fun.,Good,Good,Good
My wife and I had breakfast here August 30th. We always have a great time here....the food and service are consistent. The breakfast burrito was fantastic! We'll be back.,Good,Good,
Skip this one. After seated waited so long and a server finally asked if we had been helped because the. Hostess seated us in a closed station. Once order taken drink came our wrong and another long wait. Bread pudding not good but the ice and whipped cream were. Bacon was crispy. Good orange juicy. Smoky because right at edge of casino and open air to it. I would skip this one.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"Scrumptious shrimp tacos here as well as avocado toast, carne asada tacos, and a bbq shrimp appetizer served with toast points (the bbq sauce is exquisite). Ask for the jalape√±o cream sauce for tacos - it is delectable.


 I had eaten here in the past and it was always good and dependable.  Drinks are good here as is the food and service.  Definitely a must stop at least once on a Vegas spree!",Good,,Good
A 4% RRF has been added to your total bill.  Another ridiculous way to suck money out of your pocket.. Why is this even a charge?,,Bad,
"I remember visiting the Cafe many years ago with family, and had fond memories.   So my wife & I revisited on our recent trip for an early morning breakfast.
Unfortunately, like memories, service fades over time‚Ä¶


We ordered two All American breakfasts, with one extra egg each, hers poached with bacon and mine over MEDIUM with sausage.


When breakfast arrived, both orders had bacon‚Ä¶.   I was flexible enough that although annoyed, I would eat the substitution.   However, when I cut in to my egg whites, they immediately ran all across my plate.  I assume that is even less than over EASY.


Since I was reduced to essentially just eating the three yolks, I did finish my meal before my wife, and with my napkin over the remaining liquid egg whites, the server came and took my plate.


My wife was still eating, and was talking to me.   A moment later the server came by, and without asking if she had finished, just came and scooped up her plate, to end the meal.


To top it all off, I felt a bit off later in the afternoon, which I attributed to the undercooked eggs.


As a last point, when we got home, I was watching reviews of things to watch out for in Las Vegas and realized that I didn‚Äôt check to see if the bill included the bogus RFF charge that some reviewers indicate is added to bills at this location.


Sadly, I won‚Äôt be taking a stroll down this memory lane any time again.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We were starving after our flight and Saul was charming, fast to take our order and very easy to communicate with. Food was great too. We‚Äôll be back!",Good,Good,Good

When in Vegas we stay at Caesars and always have breakfast at Cafe Americano. Pleasant atmosphere. Great food and huge portions at a reasonable price. Always awesome service regardless of the server.

You won‚Äôt be sorry.,Good,Good,Good

"I was in Las Vegas for three days and ate at the AMERICANO cafe for breakfast 3 times. The food was very tasty, abundant and unforgettably delicious. With the warm friendly nature of Jennifer on one occasion and Isaiah on another, they enhanced our dining experience very much. I was very pleased to see the manager ( Oscar ) going from table to table inquiring about the status of their meal. That was a very warm gesture indicating the utmost concern of every patron. With any future trip to Las Vegas, I will make it a point to dine at the AMERICANO cafe and ask for the excellent service of Jennifer and Isaiah. When you want a great meal with superb service, where ever you are in Las Vegas, the AMERICANO cafe is the place you should be!",Good,Good,Good

"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but i just felt like i needed to. My family and I just flew in and we‚Äôre exhausted. My dad was sick and needed food and to go to bed. The hostess, Roxy or Roxanna I feel bad i just don‚Äôt remember, but she was super sweet and quoted us 10 minutes. She actually sat us in less than 5. We were so happy and grateful. Our server, Viri was so sweet and had great recommendations. She was super patient with my dad that was overly grouchy. We had the rib-eye, some guava type shrimp, wings, calamari, bacon and avocado sandwich, crab soup and pancakes. It was all delish. There was so much bacon in that sandwich we had to pull it apart and pass it around the table. The food came out quickly ( my dad did warned that he needed it out quickly, I was so embarrassed). The manager, Ingrid came by a few times. She was cool and funny. She asked what was going on with the bacon? I hope she didn‚Äôt think we were drunk. We told her the story and we all laughed. By this time my dad got a second wind. We left and decided to come back for breakfast. Ingrid said she would not be there but breakfast was awesome! We were so happy with everything. What started out as a bad landing at the airport turned out to be a great meal and great service and lots of laughs.",Good,Good,Good

Great service. Great location. I just really wish I don‚Äôt have to put 100 characters in the review. Thank you.,,Good,Good
Avocado toast is great. Highly recommend the build your own. Will is a great server. Get there early because it gets packed later.,Good,Good,Good
"Slow service and way overpriced. Too worried about filling the restaurant than offering a food level of service to customers.


The restaurant is located inside Caesar‚Äôs Palace which is also a complete disappointment so that says it all.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had a quick bite here before our show. We ordered the carne asada nachos. They were decent, an average portion. Our waiter was very chatty and entertaining.",Good,,Good
I decided to try Cafe Americano because I wanted a sit down breakfast and didn't want to leave the hotel. It was actually good. The chicken and waffles was surprisingly good. My only complaint is the coffee. It was just ok. My server (I think his name was Renee) was very attentive.,Good,,Good
"I accidentally stopped by the Cafe Americano bar. I was waiting for my friends to arrive at our meeting point. I decided to have a drink. And beat idea I decided to make. Yandy the bartender there was amazing. Great service, knowledgeable about not only drinks but the food menu there. He was so friendly and all the staff received every customer with a nice welcome and a smile. Anytime you are at the Ceasar palace don‚Äôt forget to stop at the Cafe American and ask for Yandy!",,Good,Good
"Very nice lunch!  Great street tacos and chopped salad.  It was 
a nice option to order a half size salad. Good too!",Good,,Good
"Breakfast was very good, my favorite meals, lunch and dinner options not bad, salads were very good and a good selection of sandwiches and other meals. I love sitting at the bar because the staff was very friendly",Good,Good,Good
"This was our go to place at Ceasers Palace. Food was a little better than average in quantity and quality.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  Wish they had little more selection at dinner menu. Breakfast was best selection, really loved the granola with fruit bowl.",Good,Good,Good
"Went for breakfast - we both ordered a veggie omelet not realizing that it was a ""build your own"" type thing. Needless to say, our waiter didn't bother to ask what veggies we wanted but took it upon himself to add every single veggie available. Our total cost for 2 Denny's type omelets was $66.00!!!!!!!!!! Add onto that 2 black coffees $11.00 and one smoothie $12.00 - our BREAKFAST bill totaled with tax $96.46!!!! FOR BREAKFAST! Buyer beware! Our fault for not looking closely at the menu and assuming that ""Veggie omelet"" was a thing like a ""Denver omelet"" but out waiter could have clarified what veggies we wanted.  Save your money and walk across the street to Hash House a Go Go!!!! WAY better food, for WAY less money and you get SO MUCH food there!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"You have to eat and this was close. We were waiting for our room and tried it. Food was very good, the little guy giving water and coffee was terrific.  The waiter had too many tables",Good,,
"Not a lot of variety, not much in the way of vegetarian. I think I had pizza ( really am not sure)...one of us had a burger and fries, a salad was involved. Anyway, it was nothing special. Overpriced but it is Las Vegas so not a surprise.",Bad,,
"It took forever to be sat because the hostess clearly had no clue what she was doing and was very rude.  They had a party of 8 waiting to be sat but they had no tables for a party of 8 available so we all had to wait even though they had almost over 10 tables available for 2 to 4.  When I asked she ignored me.   Once we were finally sat it took forever to be greeted over 10 minutes.  Out glasses where empty most the time.  
The meal was way over priced but food was ok.  My eggs on the eggs benedict were way over cooked.  The fries were not as good as fast food fries.  Avoid this place at all cost.",,Bad,Bad
"We were staying at Caesars so we stopped quick as we were headed out the for the day. We felt the hostesses were unwelcoming, but it was somewhat busy. My son wanted pancakes, and I ordered the waffle. I expect food in Vegas to be expensive, but a $20+ waffle shouldn‚Äôt taste like dry cardboard or be served with cheap syrup.  My son‚Äôs pancakes were slightly better, but not much. Our server, Cliff, stopped to take our order and once to give us the check but nothing in between and seemed irritated and rushed. The only positive here was Sergio B, who very kindly brought my coffee, made sure I had everything I wanted to go in it, and offered to bring me another cup in a to-go cup before we left. 5 stars for Sergio B, 1 for everything else.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We ate there twice. The food was excellent! The fish & chips my wife had was amazing. The two servers, Fernando and Juan, were terrific!",Good,,Good
"Sis and I visited for dinner and ate at the outdoor bar. I had the fish and chips and sis had the mahi mahi. Mu F&C were the best I had ever had. It was hot and crispy and the fish was flaky. I would definitely have it again! I had the 'merican Mary and sis had the Mezcal Mary. Both were really tasty, but the 'merican was my favorite. Very smoky and savory. If the weather is suitable, I would highly recommend sitting outside as it is in an excellent position to people watch as it is right next to the main entrance.",Good,Good,
"very tasty, stuff is very friendly.
very loud, works 24/7, bar is always open
not many tables for a big company",Good,Bad,Good
"I had craving for food after a concert and decided to drop by here. I was here before and it was good.
This visit was very disappointing. I had the bisque soup which was good. This chicken was so salty I could only eat a couple. It was a very long wait to be seated too. Service was long. Of course when they ran your bill they show you where to click the tip which the lowest was 18%. I would have given less except the server was nice and it‚Äôs not really his fault the food was awful.
Skip this place. Better options there/",Bad,Bad,Bad
Big portions and tasty food. I only ate here one morning of my stay at the Paris hotel because of the high prices.,Good,,
"Great food, nice atmosphere, Rene our server was a joy, friendly (not fake). We highly recommend it. When looking for a place come here",Good,Good,Good
"Visited on Oct. 12 at 11:12 am.  2 people for breakfast - 2 omelets (1 egg white = $27.00 and one regular = $25.00), 2 coffees = $11.00, 2 Pico de Gallos (very small = $4.00).  Bill was $72.61 and then with tip = $86.00.  What a rip off!  The omelets were okay - nothing special; coffee was fine ($5.50 per cup and it was just a regular tasting coffee), pico de Gallo was so bland, we asked for Chulpa to give it some zip.  The only thing of any help was our waiters Gustavo B.  He was very nice and we gave him 20% tip for his attentive.  I was so disappointed with the food.  Next morning we walked to Denny‚Äôs and had a wonderful meal.  The omelets were better, potatoes were cooked and the toast was warm.  The cost of our meal was just $ 32.54 with Chris as our server and with a 20% tip, our bill was lldn",Bad,Bad,Good
"I loved their Burrata & Avocado CapreSse, it has a different twist than other places. My husband and I shared a turkey focaccia, and we loved it too even though it was huge.
My husband also had as starter the crab soup and he loved it. 
We had dinner 2 times there, and had the same (minus the focaccia the second time) while on our stay at the Paris Hotel.",Good,,
We ate at location inside Caesars Palace. Had appetizers since we didn‚Äôt have a lot of time.  Wings with sauce on the side were excellent.  Also had New Orleans shrimp.  Sauce was good but shrimp were a tad over cooked.  I dipped it he wings in the sauce and it was amazing.,Good,,
"We are here our first night at the Paris. 
Food was bad. Had to spit out my fish taco. 
Caesar salad was fine. Were able to be seated quickly which was great. Would not eat dinner here again unless we were desperate.",Bad,,Good
"This is more of a warning then a review, on June 30th we had breakfast at the American Cafe in Caesars. We stay at Caesars often and have eaten any the American before.  This time I decided to pay with points the meal for 2 was $86.xx I had a celebration dinner for $100 and a 186.00 dollars in comps . I ask the waiter to use $80.00 of the points and put the remaining amount on my cc so I could tip with my card. He brought back my recipe all handled as I requested. Several hrs later I checked my point balance and $160 was missing. Apparently the American charged double points. No one told me this was the case so I spent with a $20.00 tip $186.xx for a breakfast for two.",Bad,,Bad
"Fantastic food! The menu is extensive and has an excellent variety of offerings. The fish and chips are the best I've ever had. My husband loved the Cuban. Fast, friendly service in a clean environment with a casual but fun atmosphere.",Good,Good,Good
"Great spot for a quick coffee, snack or a drink. Quite noisy, but no other concerns. The drinks are excellent and the service is also. A little bit of a wait, but not a major concern",Good,,Good
"Cafe Americano is open 24 hours a day and is located right at the entrance of Caesar‚Äôs Palace with an outdoor bar and seating option as well as indoors, making it a very convenient option for any meal or situation. My wife and I arrived a little early and had to wait a couple of hours until check-in so we grabbed lunch here and we‚Äôre satisfied with the service and quality. The prices are expensive but not for Las Vegas standards. Anyone complaining about the prices here is in for a rude awakening.",Good,Good,Good
$30 for a chicken wing appetizer? Nachos over $35? This cafe has very poor quality food with ridiculous prices. The prices should be lower until the food quality improves.,Bad,,
Great food & great service! Camilo A. is the best! We were new to Miami and he gave great advice! Highly recommend!,Good,,Good
"Terrible experience waiting for a to go order. Standing by wondering if I have been completely forgotten, which is what it seems.",,Bad,Bad
"They changed ownership and this restaurant is not part of Paris. So first off you don't get points or can pay with rewards. But most shocking was the price of Breakfast.  $23 for your basic breakfast was shocking especially when Hexx and Mon Ami Gambi was charging half the price. Not only was the pricing shocking the service was horrible. As a resident of Vegas, we go to the strip every so often and know prices are more than local places. But this is shameful.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We sat at the outside section on a warm afternoon in April of 2021.  There was a very large screen showing a soccer match and I guess I watched my first soccer game - and enjoyed it!


We had one appetizer order of  Cheese and Avocado Quesadillas, which were surprisingly good, and three tasty brews.


Total with tip: $62 (which is pretty expensive, I think) but we enjoyed sitting in the outside area on a beautiful day so because of that - - worth it!",Good,Good,
"We stopped here for lunch mainly due to proximity when we got hungry walking the Strip. The food was good, portions were good, and the staff was friendly and efficient. There was a bit of a wait to get a table. Prices can best be described as ridiculous ($25 for a burger or sandwich).


From a COVID safety perspective there is some risk. Many people waiting were not wearing masks. The tables were separated, but still a bit close together. Some were right next to the line.",Good,Bad,Good
"Mainly eaten breakfast there. Great omelette. 
Excellent bread choices. Hashed brown potatoes a little salty for my taste. Great coffee!",Good,,
"staff was underwhelming, seems like they all dislike their jobs. Food was OUTRAGEOUS. A breakfast bill of $95.00 for three people. We ordered one omelette, two orders of pancakes, one order of sausage and 2 cups of coffee. Yes, that's it! Food was not prepared to our specifications. All I wanted was an english muffin toasted well and it was barely toasted at all and the omelette was so overcooked, it was like rubber. NEVER AGAIN...",Bad,Bad,Bad
Celebrating my grand daughter birthday we sat at the bar with Chantal. She was funny charming and professional. Gave us helpful directions.,,,Good
"We stopped for dinner and were seated immediately.   The menu is not huge but had just a bit of everything including a vegan quinoa bowl, seafood and steak.


Edgar provided outstanding service and was quick and attentive.   I thought the prices were high and the music was so loud that conversation was difficult",,Bad,Good
"I have actually been to Paris several times and never was treated as poorly as Jennifer S.  Not sure what was going on, but the soup I tried (she crab) was very good.",Good,,Bad
"The service was just ok and the food was Mediocre for the outrageous prices that they charge, Also the food did not have that great of flavor. we Expected a lot more flavor and service for the prices they are charging we will not be back.",Bad,Bad,
I wanted a patio seat given the pandemic precautions and the weather was perfect for that. Easy access to the cafe right off Caesar‚Äôs registration lobby. Nice interior portion of restaurant but equally welcoming outdoor seating with bar and large screen TVs playing sports. Sunny and warm. Menu was tasty. Got a Bloody Mary and Cuban sandwich. Nice variety of lunch and good breakfast items. A little pricey but you get a good view of the Caesar‚Äôs outdoor plaza and sidewalk.,Good,Good,
"Okay, first things first, food was AMAZING! I ordered the Cuban and it was incredible. I was a bit out of at first simply because it seemed like a small portion, and in a pretty sizeable dude, so my first thought was, ""that's it?"" But seriously, it was perfect. 


Everything was cooked just right. Bread was toasty but soft. The different meats were crispy and tender. Even the fries were amazing. 


Been here twice so far during our short stay, but it's highly recommended!",Good,,
"open 24 hours..pretty pricey but consider where it is.. inside Caesars..yea..bring your wallet..$26.00 for 2 pancakes, 2 ham slices,2 pieces of toast and potatoes..$8.00 for coffee..$13.00 for VIRGIN bloody mary..$7.00 for a coke..",,Good,
"Plenty breakfast favorites to choose from. The most tasty were the potatoes, turkey sausage and pancakes. The mimosa wasn‚Äôt bad either. The prices are a little high but most eateries are.",Good,,
"Had shrimp appetizer and branzino.  Shrimp was too sweet and tails not well trimmed of shells.  Cloyingly sweet sauce and shrimp were not jumbo.


Branzino was a disaster.  It smelled fishy and not fresh.  Vegs were a lump of corn, peppers with seeds not cleaned out and potato chunks.  Greasy.  Too much oil everywhere.  Not a clean dish.  Could only eat a little as fish smell was pungent.  Then gave up.  Wait staff was efficient , but could not care less as to the customer‚Äôs needs.  Not well trained.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This place looked good however I was very disappointed with their breakfast.  I had a Bacon, cheddar, tomato omelet with home fries and toast.  Omelet tasted over cooked and not seasoned.  Home fries were ok.  Toast was just grocery store bread.  


Service was good and the place was very clean and people were spaced out nicely.",Bad,Good,Good
"Just checked into Caesar's and we decided to have lunch here at Cafe Americano. We were greeted and seated quickly. Juan was our server and gave us great service! I had the fish and chips, it was very good! My wife had the chicken sandwich which was also very good! Not very busy on this Monday, covid and all. Atmosphere was great! A bit pricey but hey, this is Caesar's!",Good,Good,Good
food was excellent--service great--higher priced than expected. It had a line waiting the social distanceing was well done,Good,Good,Good
"Pretty busy but Kristina my server, was right by my side in a moment. 5 steps off the front desk of the caesars palace check in and offers a complete menu. Fruit as fresh and crisp, coffee dark and hot, clean as a whistle. Easy in and easy out. Food to go if you are in a hurry.",Good,,Good
"Love this place. Great food, fantastic service. What can I say when I stay in Vegas this is where I eat Breakfast.",Good,Good,Good
"Good place to eat if you enjoy over priced food, rude waiters, noise and very average meals. Wife‚Äôs steak was loaded with fat ad chewy for $50. I, mistakenly, ordered breakfast eggs and sausage. Disaster. Cold potatoes. Poorly cooked eggs. Cold toast. Nevermore sayith the raven.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The morning staff at the bar are all amazing very friendly and give great service. Always going above and beyond, thank you nice to see that customer service is still professional.",,,Good
"We had breakfast here, nothing very exciting and we thought it was overpriced. Over 60 dollars for 2, small fresh orange was 8 dollars! Staff friendly and service good.",Bad,,Good
"My wife and I don't gamble or drink so we go to Vegas to escape Minnesota winter, east and shop.  We ate here on 02-19-2020 and the only part of the meal that was acceptable was the fries.  My buyer was cold and overcooked the cheese was not even melted or soft.  My wife food was so underprepared she had to send it back.  We brought both issues to our servers attention and she did not even apologize or make any offer to remedy the situation.  I asked to speak to a manager but after waiting ten minutes neither a manager or our server ever returned.  we left our money on the table and vowed to never return.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Extremely over priced, service was poor on all 3 visits, there was never a wait, which is why we were there on 3 separate occasions.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Real basic breakfast in a clean setting. Service was good. Home fries were terrible. Tasteless and soggy.,Bad,,Good
"As Senior citizens paying $25.00 each for breakfast was just too much.   But no worries as we will never stay at Caesars  Palace again.  Not after being told how  much we had had to bet each hand at machine poker to get a free drink, and the bar tender keep upping it.  They want to squeeze every quarter out of you.  I have only stayed at Caesars  but time to try a new one",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We stopped in for dinner before a show and although our choices were simple salads, pizza and spaghetti and meatballs, the service was outstanding and the drinks were well prepared.",Good,Bad,Good
"I find that a lot of the mid-range restaurants on The Strip lack real concern and care about the customer. Terraza is a welcome exception to that.


We were seated by a host that allowed us to take time to find the table with the ideal combination of overhead heat and noise (not too much of either). We were then greeted by a server who was so enthusiastic that I wanted to hire him for my new startup. This was a followed up by a manager that checked multiple times to see how we were doing. Awesome!


The food was great! I had a chicken taco and then the greek bowl with chicken. My wife had a fish taco and the garbanzo bowl. She asked for a bed of lettuce (not standard) and they came though in spades.


I highly recommend this place for a great dining experience on the Strip.",Good,Good,Good
This restaurant is very convenient and reasonably priced.  Even though it is attached to the lobby of Caesar's Palace it is NOT part of the hotel.,Good,Good,
"We were looking for a convenient place to eat breakfast and ended up at Cafe Americano. We were seated promptly and our server was reasonably timely. We ended up splitting a meal so as not to pay the $26 price tag. We ordered the Huevos Rancheros. They were good but, overall, the experience was unremarkable. The place was packed and we didn't get the feeling that anyone appreciated our business. In all likelihood, would not choose to eat here again.",Good,Bad,Good
"Ate at Cafe Americano the morning of Super Bowl Sunday. We were quickly seated out our table but it took a while for us to place our drink order. It seemed like a gentleman who was manager had to come take our drink order plus our food order. 


Took a good bit for our cocktails to arrive. Took even longer for our food. Only saw our waitress really a few times and she never really gave us a chance to order another round of drinks. 


One of our group, did order another drink with the manager. He must have got busy and forgot. He later returned and apologized, putting his drink on the house. 


Another server brought our checks. He offered to split our checks and got irritated when we told him that would be great.  Honestly, do not know if they were overwhelmed setting up for the Super Bowl but I felt like it took way too long for breakfast food.",,,Bad
"If you are looking for a great breakfast in Las Vegas, then Cafe Americano is the perfect spot.  Fantastic menu with all your early morning favorites.  I had the pancakes and they were perfect.  The service was great and it's a wonderful spot for people watching while you enjoy your morning meal.",Good,Good,Good
"Way, way, way overpriced super market sandwich food. No tables for late night dining. Good luck sitting at the bar with the drunks.",Bad,Bad,
"Happy hour! I‚Äôm not a nachos fan. My wife likes them. I ordered nachos. Thats what you do if you are married and want to stay married. I was eyeing some additional ‚Äúhappy hour‚Äù items but our server warned us that the nacho plate would be huge and more than enough for two. Good man. He was right. Did his recommendation reduce company profit in this situation? Perhaps. Did his honesty endear us to Cafe Americano? Absolutely! I have to admit, the nachos were not bad. I visit Vegas on a regular basis. I have my go to spots for food. I‚Äôve added Cafe Americano to that list.",Good,,Good
I had a quick bite before the Absinthe show at Caesars.I had two tacos which were surprisingly good! And affordable too! As this is an outside bar and the evening was cool my tacos were a little cold but still good!,Good,,
"Very good for breakfast, but high priced like everything else in Caesars.  The surprise is the dinner menu which is much more reasonable and the food is very good.  An added bonus is the breakfast items available on the dinner/late night menu.  The only negative, which probably keeps the prices down, is the ambiance of the outside section of the bar being the lobby bar where loud drunk people hang out.  This is not an issue if you are seated away from the bar, but if you are seated at a quiet table in the bar area it's definitely a distraction.",Good,,
"We had breakfast twice, and supper once.  Our breakfasts were fine, a little pricy, but fine. Our supper was awesome, we split a BLT and our waiter was so awesome, he put half on each plate with our own little basket of fries and ketchup, instead of just bringing us a extra plate.  That was very thoughtful and appreciated.  His name was Fernando and he was just super.  This was our last meal before heading home the next day, so a great end to the vacation.",Good,Good,Good
"This restaurant is inside of Caesars Palace and is a very good place to eat for breakfast.  If you are not a big eater, it is enuff to split for 2",Good,Good,
A little diner in Caesars.  It seems like a little dinner with a good menu.  I did breakfast and it was clean and hearty.  Very nice eats. You can get in and out very quickly.,Good,,Good
"I tried the restaurant for breakfast and sat at the bar. The menu offers your more traditional options. The service was attentive and pleasant. The decor is on the more attractive side. 


The eggs Benedict were good with the home style potatoes. The Benedict was standard. The potatoes were very good and stood out!!


The portion was mid sized. The prices were on par for Vegas and it was a good start to the day.",Good,Good,Good
"The food was OK, the service is OK too.  But very slow. 
This place is good for the breakfast.  Good is open 24 hours.",Good,Good,
Sit inside the restaurant at the Bar when Eddie and Chantel are working .... appreciate the AMAZING bar experience! Great drinks and an authentic atmosphere. We could seriously go anywhere and we choose to come back here. It will always be a stop on our Vegas day! You won‚Äôt be disappointed! We also met Jose (manager) and enjoyed our visit with him. Love seeing a great team atmosphere from the bar - unusual in today‚Äôs environment! Can‚Äôt wait to come back!!!,,Good,Good
"This was the best option for a sit-down, full-service breakfast at Caesar's Palace. Frittata and avocado toast dishes were excellent! Service was very good also!",Good,Good,Good
"Had a great breakfast here Christmas day morning g.  Very friendly waiter.  Service was prompt but not rushed.  Breakfast came quickly.  Food portions big, food well presented, and hot.  Located just off the main lobby.  Has a nice bar area as well.",Good,Good,Good
Everything on the menu is great.  The tops vieja nachos are amazing and enough for four people to share. The coffee is so good. You won't be disappointed.,Good,,
"Our server, Saul, was awesome! He recommended the pork nachos-said they were the best in Las Vegas- and they did not disappoint. Pizza was great, too. Highly recommend.",Good,,Good
"let‚Äôs start with the good. This place is good for a quick bite to eat, has a nice outside setting, and has a large projector screen which is perfect for watching any sort of major sporting event that might be going on that you care to watch. Our waitress was super kind and attentive, and our food didn‚Äôt take that long to be made, but we only ordered individual tacos to be honest. Now for the not so good. The hostess/host was not very good at hosting, in the sense that he kept walking away from the stand leaving potential customers to wonder if they should just seat themselves in the restaurant or continue to wait, we continued to wait for a few minutes until until the bartender noticed us, the motioned at something behind a wall and then suddenly the host magically reappeared, and he didn‚Äôt seem to be disappearing from his stand for work related purposes, but rather to mess around on his cell phone (as we were dining we could see him go off to the side behind a wall and take out his phone). Myself and my husband were only interested in a small bite to eat so we each ordered single tacos. One of my tacos was the shrimp ceviche taco, which turned out to be just crudely diced up shrimps from a shrimp cocktail and some tomatoes and peppers, this was not a true ceviche by any stretch of the imagination. My husband didn‚Äôt care too much for the tacos he ordered either and they were so lack luster that he couldn‚Äôt even remember what he had ordered from this place a few days later (and no, alcohol did not play a part in lack of memory recall). The food wasn‚Äôt bad tasting (more like just ‚Äúblah‚Äù), but not something I would seek out either, there are so many more options for quick bites on the Vegas strip that I wouldn‚Äôt waste your time here.",Bad,Good,
Like an old style diner. One entre can feed two folks. Excellent service and the food was good. I need more characters to make this review work.,Good,Good,Good
"dined here for breakfast, waiter couldn't get our order right even after repeating 4 times, the other waiter understood. Had eggs and later on vomited as I dont think eggs were cooked enough and the bacon was really strong. Wouldnt have breakfast here again at all",Bad,Bad,Bad
"It was mid morning but that should not matter for a 24/7 restaurant, we were seated promptly (2 of us) however we did not get to order drinks for a few minutes then it would take another 3-5 minutes to get the drinks (I know that doesn't sound like long but when your thirsty its forever).


We ordered when he brought drinks back, a large group was seated next to us and after a 20 min wait the large group received their food and we still had not.


We finally found our waiter and he went to check on it, 5 minutes later we received our food some warm and some of it cold, we were hungry so we ate it and it was fine nothing special or over the top but the lack of service will keep of from returning.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We decided to grab some food before going for The Circ Du Soleil O Show. 
The food was quite good with decent size portions. They have a mix of western and Italian food plus wines to choose from. The service was quite good, prompt and courteous.",Good,,Good
"Decided to have dinner here since we had tickets to Absinthe at 8 pm.  Cafe Americano is how the Las Vegas strip does a coffee shop.  Beautiful interior, superb location, outstanding service and expensive food.  While our meal was good, the price tag will knock you over with a feather.",,Good,Good
"Egg White Frittata was bland. Needed hot sauce to wake it up. the service was ok, after bringing a couple empty coffee cups to their attention.",Bad,,
"In short is was awful. We split the frittata. It was awful; tasteless even after I coated it with hot sauce. 


Cost? $50 for two people who ordered a single meal and split it",Bad,Bad,
We had breakfast here several times on our recent Thanksgiving Week trip and the food was EXCELLENT and the staff is OVER THE TOP! We loved the EggsBenedict with home style fries and the Avocado Toast!,Good,,Good
"Spontaneous stop for dinner before a show and was well worth it. Service staff were friendly, very accommodating for a food allergy.
Recommended food from the menu which was totally correct.
Food was absolutely delicious 
Would definitely recommend this restaurant",Good,,Good
"stopped by the patio for happy hour with a few co workers after a long day of meetings. great tiny bites!!!! Danny the patio manager suggested the rib and tuna tacos and he didn't disappoint, couldnt stop ordering them (so good ) also the happy hour mules and margaritas were AMAZING!!!!!!! if you in vegas looking for a great place to people watch and enjoy some great food this is your place!!!!! ask for DANNY and Jessica!!!",Good,Good,Good
"Not that the food was bad, just not prepared well. Had breakfast here twice this week. Restaurant was busy both times. First experience, I never received the smoothie ordered and over medium eggs were served over easy. Second experience, restaurant busier than before, ordered eggs over medium again, even made sure server knew what over medium meant...eggs over barely, actually cold. Ugh!! 
They ordered more to be prepared properly, after a time, I just cancelled. It was taking tooo long. 


The food I did eat was tasty. Don‚Äôt be in a hurry. Make them cool food properly.",Bad,Bad,
"During our first morning in Vegas, our group of 6 decided to just grad breakfast here before heading out for the day, unfortunately we didn't look at the menu's before deciding.  We got in line  and then noticed others going in next to the line and being seated.  Once we got closer we realized that the other side was for Ceasars elite members.  So even though there was a wait, if a table opened up the Caesars elite members were given the next table.  One in our group has that status so we eventually moved over and were seated quickly.  I understand wanting to show appreciation for your elite members but it just seemed unfair because if you are in the regular line and 200 members show you, you would have to wait a very long time.  When we sat down we noticed the prices, and were all a bit surprised.  I ordered a $26 omelette, a basic omelette.  When it came it was just warm, not hot.  No one was impressed with their food.  Everyone had the same thought, decent food, that was expensive.  I would never go back there.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Service provided here was top notch, very attentive and the food was delivered to us off the grill.  The coffee was so-so but it was good breakfast, spendy, but good.",Good,,Good
Servers are great. They will take care of anything you ask for.  Lunch is good and everything was tasty!!  Was really good and fun.  Grey place for lunch.,Good,Good,Good
Had an overpriced breakfast of scrambled eggs and toast for myself while my sister had pancakes.  The eggs were overcooked and the pancakes were dry even with syrup.  We let the waiter that we didn‚Äôt like our meal and he didn‚Äôt even respond.  I will not eat there again.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"My wife and I wanted a quick meal at Caesars before a concert. The service was ok.  Everything there is expensive and is to be expected. But, the food quality was poor and even with the expected high price, there was little value. The restaurant was virtually empty.  I‚Äôm my opinion, it‚Äôs the food quality more than the price.",Bad,Bad,Good
Right outside the Absinthe tent. Went in for drinks and appetizers but surprised by how tasty. The guacamole quesadilla was awesome but the table bread was out of this world. Not just for breakfast. Real food.,Good,,
"Had breakfast here yesterday, two of four orders were wrong, wait staff seemed rushed and working many tables. On the two American breakfasts the hash browns were over cooked, bacon was ordered crisp but was burnt. Head waiter? said sorry but that was it. Maybe I just expect more from a restaurant at Caesar‚Äôs when I‚Äôm paying $70.00 for two breakfasts.",Bad,,Bad
The menu has something for everyone and the staff is exceptionally professional and friendly.  Breakfast at Cafe Americano is the best way to start the day.,Good,Good,Good
The food was pretty good but kind of pricey for a 24 hour coffee shop.  Employees were wonderful and accomadating to your requests.  I kind of chuckle ...back home coffee shops not so accomadating but not so pricey.,Good,Good,Good
"On our recent Vegas trip, we had breakfast here.  A little expensive, but the food was excellent (GF options were satisfactory for my coeliac spouse). Try the crispy shrimp omelet! Great friendly service from Cliff!",Good,,Good
"Our server was awesome and informative. But didn't mention the HUGE portions. Of course we didn't ask either.


There were four of us, and each had something different. All of us thoroughly enjoyed our meal. 


It's also a great location if you are heading to Absinthe for the show.",Good,Good,Good
"Had drinks here in the afternoon and then met friends later for dinner. Just outside Caesars Palace, its a fab outdoor setting. Yummy tacos!! 
Cute and friendly barmen lol",Good,Good,Good
"Open 24 hours, this is located in the lobby of Caesars and extends onto the patio. The service is first class and the food is excellent.",Good,Good,Good
"We stopped by Cafe Americano twice during our most recent stay at Caesars, once for breakfast and once for dinner and drinks.  Both were solid.  The breakfast was large and filling and the coffee was excellent. My wife had the tacos for dinner and recommends them, as tasty and spicy.  The drinks were very well made, again my wife recommends the blueberry lemon drop!  The only negative I can say would be the price.  The All-American traditional breakfast, three eggs, ham, hash browns, and toast was $23 and the bottomless cup of coffee was $5.50, and they also give you a to-go cup that you can refill during the day!  So come hungry and bring your wallet!",Good,Good,
"I ate breakfast at Cafe Americano and had a great omelet with wonderful service but was somewhat surprised by the high prices. Well worth trying once, but there are other good restaurants with more reasonable prices around.",Bad,,Good
"Not ""great"" food but Good. Wonderful, friendly and fast service.  Very efficient waitstaff. Great bartenders.",Good,,Good
Very good breakfast with huge portions! Had the omelet and French toast and they were both really good.,Good,,
"Cafe Americano in the lobby of Caesar‚Äôs Palace in Las Vegas is a great place to enjoy any type of food from a great breakfast to a variety of lunch offerings and even full dinners.
The food is excellent but what impressed us even more was the impeccable service.
Once seated a waiter or waitress will immediately fill you‚Äôre water glass and inquire about any other beverage you might desire.
I had breakfast 3 times and each time the eggs were cooked exactly as requested and the bacon was just right.
For lunch I recommend either the Cuban sandwich or any of the club type offerings.
In closing you can satisfy your tastes and hunger 24-7 at this popular restaurant.",Good,Good,Good
"I had 3 meals at this place during my 3-day stay because it was so good. It's not the most budget-friendly, but it's worth it. And not many meals worth speaking about are. My favorite meal which I had twice for breakfast, was French Toast. It seems like a mundane thing to order, but it's absolutely delicious. Cooked perfectly, and big enough to get your day started. Friendly and attentive service. Never waited long. Definitely would recommend! Plus open 24-hours!",Good,Good,Good
"When in Vegas, we decided to have breakfast at Cafe Americano located at the entrance of Caesar's Palace. In few words: Friendly service, nice ambiance and tasty but HUGE portions. When ordering, please consider one plate every two persons to avoid wasting food and money!",Good,Good,Good
"We decided to have a nice dinner at Caesars, our hotel of choice this trip. It was a spur of the moment type thing, no reservations needed, no line, no waiting of any kind.


We both ordered from the tasting menu, nice choices available. The clam chowder with 3 kinds of potato, bacon, big clams was delicious to start.


We finished with New York Strip and fingerling potatoes, arugula salad. My steak was cooked to perfection. 


The staff was friendly and efficient. The atmosphere is really nice, classy, perfect lighting, quiet, and just what we needed after winning tons of money!


Can be pricey depending, but well worth it. Hey! You're on vacay, right?


Sandwiches, entrees, appetizers all looked good. We had a hard time deciding.


I would visit again.",Good,Good,Good
"We stopped here for a drink before seeing Absinthe because the show tent is located just steps away. We sat on the patio and were served very quickly. The waitress was very nice and gave us some tips about the show and let us know there was not a restroom in the tent, which was very useful info! I would stop by this patio again for a few drinks.",,Good,Good
The food was good but very pricey.  The wait service wasn't as fast however we didn't wait long for our food.  Would not be my top choice for breakfast.,,,
"Ah, just what we were looking for. We were tired hungry. It had been a long day and this was just what we needed.


Calamari and Steak Tacos",Good,,
"We ordered our food, asked for fries and was served hash browns.  Omelette was great, too much cheese.  The serving staff, absolutely great.",Good,,Good
This is a break from the high priced meals around town.  The service is good and the food was well worth it.  Sneak in here if you are going to see Absinthe at Ceasars.,Good,,Good
"This is a good place to eat at Caesar's Palace..Like most places it is a pricey, but you get very large portions.  Many items can be shared!",Good,,
"We stayed in Caesars recently and enjoyed a couple meals at Cafe Americano. The service was always great and friendly. And the food was very nice. We had the fish n chips, blackened chicken sandwich, steak and fish tacos. All excellent. And we tried their warm brownie sundae which is amazing. Kudos to our servers Ricky and Jessica for making our meals so enjoyable.",Good,Good,Good
Awesome spot to have a cocktail and people watch without the annoying on-the bar poker machine.  Stephanie was a super awesome bartender.  Great mojito!,Good,Good,Good
"I walked by and saw people eating what looked to be great breakfast dishes, so I decided to eat here. Unfortunately, mine wasn't near that level. The orange juice and toast were fine. The eggs, bacon, and potatoes were not good. The eggs were gray in places and not tasty. The potatoes were rock hard and weren't really seasoned or crisp. The waiter did bring replacement hash browns which were typical of any breakfast establishment. The bacon was shriveled and dry. Sad, what a waste of bacon. I expected at least the standards of an IHOP or Denny's. I'm really not that hard to please. I addressed it with the manager, she took my feedback sincerely which is all I wanted but she then offered to comp my bill. That wasn't my intention for speaking with her, but it did make me feel better about my sub-par meal and potentially trying to eat there again. I hope my experience gives them cause to evaluate what they send out of their kitchen more carefully.",Bad,Bad,Good
"Went there to get something fast, as we were on a schedule. Server was horrible. He told us his 3 favorite dishes, and when we asked about anything else, said ‚Äúi can‚Äôt vouch for it. If you don‚Äôt take my suggestions, you‚Äôre on your own.‚Äù  Who says that?! Indeed, everyone‚Äôs food was very mediocre - bad. Too salty. Too dry. Etc. A $24 hamburger should be good.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Came for breakfast and the options and portions were great! They serve it in a rustic feeling. The cereal was gigantic!!!,Good,Good,Good
"If you go there and do not try the smokehouse burger, you are wasting your entire holiday.  Seriously, food is excellent and imaginitive, especially for a casual place.  Cocktails are lovely too. Service was on the slow side but there is no way I am not rating this best burger of my life 5 stars.",Good,Good,Bad
"Caf√© Americano is conveniently located off the hotel lobby on the main floor of Caesar‚Äôs Palace Hotel and Casino. We ate there for the first time largely because they were one of the few restaurants close by open for a late night meal; but were pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed our meal. Although fancier than an East Coast Deli, they offer a wide variety of classic American food, including steaks and fresh seafood, chicken and pasta offerings, as well pizza, tacos and burgers. Considering their location, generous portions and quality food, their prices are fairly reasonable and the atmosphere was pleasant. I got the Hangover Burger - served on a delicious waffle and topped with bacon and a sunny side up egg. While it was really good, my Wife‚Äôs Fish and Chips were even better, so I may have that next time. The wait staff were friendly and did a fantastic job taking care of us. We were glad we stopped in for a meal and will definitely be back next time we are in town. Based on our enjoyable experience, I can‚Äôt explain some of the poor reviews left by others, except possibly maybe they might not have been in the right frame of mind to fully enjoy the experience.",Good,Good,Good
The food was delicious and it was plentiful. The servers was friendly and accomodating. Very wide selection to choose from.,Good,,Good
"Running very short of time to eat before going to the show Absinthe we asked the waiter if we could expect to eat and go within an hour, which he said he would ensure.  This restaurant is right next to the entry to the Speigl tent.   The waiting staff were friendly and helpful, we chose to eat Mexican style food and it was delicious.  And we were out in an hour.  Thank you Cafe Americano.",Good,Good,Good
This is the only 24-hour restaurant on Caesars property. Kind of disappointed that this is all you get from such a high scale motel that has 4000 rooms. Late at night it seems are more escorts and drug dealers hanging out here than anything else. Wasn't really impressed with this place does not live up to the standards of Caesars at all.,,Bad,
"We've eaten at the Cafe Americano previoiusly during our stays at Cesar's. Usually, the food is good and the service is decent. That was not the case durinig our most recent visit. We ordered a late breakfast. The meal was overpriced and mediocore at best. Not sure what went wrong.",Bad,,Good
We had breakfast at this restuarant and it was excellent. The portions were really big and staff was very friendly,Good,Good,Good
Fernando was amazing.  I asked what he recommended and he suggested the burgers.  I had the Classic Burger with house side salad.  The Burger was fantastic.  The beef they grind up for this is delicious.,Good,,Good
"On a 4 night stay we ate breakfast here 3 mornings! Perfect if you want a traditional breakfast. Everything cooked to order and amazing service every time! We ate dinner here one night too, it was perfect! We stayed at Caesar‚Äôs so this was convenient as well!",Good,Good,Good
"Breakfast at Cafe Americano at Caesars Vegas was indeed a challenge when our orders arrived! Huge! Corn Cakes and Whites Omelette were superb with tasty fresh ingredients. Try as we might, we were unable to finish off either but enjoyed each immensely.",Good,Good,
Cafe Americano is Caesar's 24-hour restaurant and we had two excellent meals there. Their salads are crisp and delicious and beautiful to look at. The service at the bar was also really friendly and upbeat.,Good,Good,Good
It was late Saturday night and we were hungry and getting tired.  Figured we could get a bite here right outside of Caesar's.  Place was mostly empty.  There is no ambiance (which frankly was fine because we just needed a pick me up meal).  Service was inattentive and food was mediocre at best.  All we ordered was a salad and some fried calamari both of which were not very tasty.  Just a little surprised for a place attached to Caesar's.,Bad,,Bad
went to breakfast long lines had open table food was soso not worth the price. would not go back not servers fault he was great,Bad,,Good
"Right on ground level near hotel registration and loads of atmosphere and menu choices.  Service was good, food tasty.",Good,Good,Good
Stopped to have a few drinks while cooking off from the heat. The margarita was great and the beers were poured right. Music was nice and great people watching and view of Caesar‚Äôs.,Good,Good,
"Start your day with a Cucumber martini at brunch and nearly anything on the menu. The Cuban sandwich, Fish and Chips, and Chicken are all top tier fares! Be sure to try this eatery and you will not be disappointed!",Good,Good,
"Doing the Vegas hotel tours we stopped at cafe Americano for drinks. Had the grape and white smoothie and hubby had a coffee.
Nice friendly staff. An oasis is aur conditioned bliss and great people watching spot!",Good,Good,Good
"This wasn‚Äôt a planned occasion but after being hungover from a pool party earlier in the day, we missed dinner plans. We were staying at Caesars so it was convenient to just go down stairs to the 24 hr restaurant. Service was mostly good, with the exception of a bit of rudeness & attitude from a/our female server when we simply asked about the food since it was taking some time to come out. Other than that, the food was tasty; Caesar‚Äôs salad & chicken Alfredo. We didn‚Äôt have too much to eat since our stomachs were still alcohol ridden lol. The portions were good so we were able to take a little back to our room. Prices were not outrageous and there is quite a wide variety of options on the menu",Good,,Bad
"Stumbled on this place last year during a visit and made sure to come back to it this year, especially since we were staying at Caesars. Good and service.",Good,Good,Good
"Stopped in after Celine concert. Had a couple of drinks and shared an appetizer and entree. Both were delicious, especially the artichoke hearts & chicken Alfredo pasta. Fantastic, quick & friendly service - great music too (new and old). Was in and out within 45 minutes.",Good,Good,Good
"I‚Äôve eaten here a number of times out of necessity - it‚Äôs open 24 hours, long after everything else at Caesars has closed. The food is just ok, but unfortunately comes at very disproportionately high prices due to its convenience. If you‚Äôre looking for food at normal hours, there are countless places nearby with better food at a better value. 


This time we had a burger, fries, and a Bloody Mary. I have no other words but average for the food ... by Vegas standards, it‚Äôs very subpar. Bloody Mary was quite good, and the bartenders and host were excellent and went out of their way to fit us in and give us Good. 


(Side note: If you‚Äôre staying at Caesars, it‚Äôs barely cheaper than late night room service which is actually really good! I‚Äôd stick with that.)",Bad,Good,Good
"Used to be my favorite go to in Vegas. Great spot for people watching and it is open 24/7. I just can‚Äôt believe the prices, $12 for a basic draft beer??? Bartender was a bit off the mark too, didn‚Äôt know which taps were available and served bottles instead of drafts. Kind of a mess, moved on.",Bad,Good,Bad
"We stayed at Caesar's and ended up eating here several times for breakfast, plus once for lunch and once for dinner.  The servers are excellent!  We had breakfast at the bar and were able to get to our meetings on time. Cliff was our lunch time server.  He was very helpful and friendly, as was the gentleman we had at dinner time.",,,Good
We were staying at Caesars and had tickets to see Celine Dion.  We ate early and not looking for anything too heavy since we were going to be sitting at the concert so we stopped in here.  We did not have reservations and were seated right away.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  Unfortunately I was not feeling well and asked for a clear broth/soup which I was told was not an option.  So I only had hot tea.  Our service was good but the restaurant wasn‚Äôt too busy.,Good,,Good
"Ate twice. First time service was good. Second time food did not come for over 30 minutes. Food is good, but better breakfast places and lines can be long.",Good,,
"Came here for a conference with friends.  We sat for quite awhile (at the bar) before the bartender took our order.  We then waited 15-20 minutes for our drinks.  They were small, expensive, and once we were served, the bartender went MIA. 


I guess you can get away with this a Caesar's Palace.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Food was good.  Service even better.  The portions were massive.  We could have split 2 entrees between the four of us.,Good,,Good
Trayton is BY FAR the BEST bartender we had during our stay in Vegas. We came back several nights for the great drinks and service by Trayton! We wish everyone provided the excellent service with a smile like him!,Good,,Good
The restaurant offers great food at a more reasonable price than is often found in casino restaurants.,Good,,
"We ate here on two occasions, once after a late night show, then again for a lunch. The menu is as stated in the name, a typical menu with the usual characters. The food was good and as expected. Service was a bit slow but we were not in a hurry and enjoyed sitting and chatting.",Good,,
"Visited this place for Good Friday Lunch, sitting outside in the terrace. We were after something light after a solid night out. Chicken Caesar and seared tuna salads were fresh and tasty. We couldn‚Äôt go past the grilled artichokes as an appetiser, which definitely didn‚Äôt disappoint. The portions were more than adequate, without being oversized which has been our experience at a number of restaurants in town. 


Service was prompt and friendly as we viewed multiple sports on the big screen. The ambience outside was lovely, as it‚Äôs nestled away from the traffic and noise on the strip. 


It ended up being $80 plus tip, which seemed more than reasonable for the quality of the meal. Overall it was a lovely lunch spot and would definitely recommend to others.",Good,Good,Good
"We had an early breakfast here, it was amazing.  This place gets very busy, had to make reservations.  The portion sizes were huge especially on the pancakes.  I ordered a frittata with toast and a mimosa.  My husband had the yogurt parfait and he absolutely loved it.  No complaints, everything tasted great.  Service was fast and friendly.  Would definitely recommend and would eat here again.",Good,Good,Good
"Dave (bartender) started our experience in the right foot. He was fantastic and made our day after a long flight. Had a ""Make You Own"" Bloody Mary that was the best I've ever had. And, breakfast was super! I couldn't choose, Dave helped me out and didn't disappoint! A must!",Good,Good,Good
"This restaurant is open all night which is great for post-drinking/gambling. The food was expensive (Vegas prices), but absolutely delicious. My group went here multiple times and each time had great service and food.",Good,Good,Good
"Came in for lunch with friends. Order a Cosmo and a blueberry lemon drop martini. The BLD martini is so fresh and pops in your mouth with those blueberries. The Cosmo well it's a Cosmo. We ordered the Ropa Vieja Nachos, chicken pops, chicken tacos, side salad, and the steak tacos. The chicken wings were just a tad bit dry and the tacos were delicious! The nachos were loaded with brisket, so delicious! Our waiter was great and we had 2 other workers come check in on us. Service was great!",Good,,Good
"Fernando H is the best waiter in town. He was attentive and personable. The food was delicious and very flavorful. Highly recommend the homefries. They were roasted with sweet potatoes and onions
 Yummy!",Good,,Good
"This restaurant is a very good place to eat. Plan on spending some money tho. We had breakfast one morning, $60. Supper was $69. That‚Äôs just normal stuff. Nothing fancy.",Good,Good,
"I sat at the bar both days that I had breakfast here and the service was fantastic.  All of the bar staff was on top of it and very friendly.  The first day, I got the green and white frittata which was delicious.  The second day, I was craving it and came 15min after breakfast had ended so it was not available but they knew how much I was craving it and made it for me anyways!  Now that is service.  I also watched them put together a ton of Bloody Mary's and was impressed that they all put on fresh gloves before touching any garnishes so there seems to be a big focus on cleanliness and food safety which is much appreciate.",Good,Good,Good
"Had the worst eggs Benedict I've ever had from the somewhat limited breakfast menu.  On the other hand, the cod sandwich was fairly good, even though I did not eat the overly doughy bun and it should have come with some lemon.  Good..",Bad,,Good
"We had supper here last night and the poor service, arrogant and neglectful waiter ruined our evening. It was a very expensive evening and the fish (in fish and chips) was over battered, not well cooked and essentially tasteless. Very disappointing.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Lovely restuarant very welcoming. The staff werr very friendly and the food was beautiful. Would definitely go back.,Good,Good,Good
We dined at the Cafe on Friday for lunch. It took 40 minutes to receive a kale salad. The food was good...but it took WAY too long for a restaurant serving lunch.  Then when we received our bill...we were billed for items that we had not ordered. We did not return there again during our visit.,Good,Bad,Bad
"we had a drink in the cafe because we were waiting for our room it is in a good location,and the service was good",,Good,Good
"I don't know if everyone gets this kind of service because the wife and I are such good looking and friendly couple. Richard, Freddy And Kristina, Great job seeing that we got everything we asked for. The service was excellent.  The food what great. I found it to be a little pricey but worth it.",Good,,Good
"Clam chowder was horrible, bread bowl was stale and the potatoes in the soup were so hard I don't think they cooked them and it was $18.99",Bad,,
"Strolling down the strip, we stopped at Americans for a bite to eat and a cocktail. 
Super friendly waiter, attentive, friendly and professional. 
We sat outside in a lovely terraced area in the sun, ordered cocktails and nachos to share. 
Wonderful food!! Huge portion, we couldn‚Äôt finish one between us both! 
Great relaxed dining in a prestigious location, recommended 100%",Good,Good,Good
The food was great and the staff was very courteous! I think it is a little expensive for what you receive but still great food!,Good,,Good
Wow !  The BLT sandwich was tasty and plenty of bacon.  It was made with sour dough bread and big slices of tomato.   I ordered it with a Caesar salad.   The lettuce was crispy and fresh.   There was a strong taste of garlic in the dressing which I was surprised with.   But if you like garlic this is for you.   My daughter ordered dessert.  She had the chocolate hazel nut cake with ice cream and whip cream.  She loved it and she would order it again.   I will definitely return to eat here.   ü•™ ü•ó üç∞.,Good,Good,
"My wife and I thought having a simple dinner at Caesar's Palace would be all that we wanted to do there on a Tuesday night after driving 4 hours to reach Las Vegas.  Amidst the high priced, fancy dining establishments in the hotel, Cafe Americano seemed like a fine choice for us that evening.  I can only think of one thing to say about the meal, even though parts of it were fine.  Somebody needs to find a salad chef for that place.  I am not kidding or exaggerating when I say that Cafe Americano's version of a Caesar Salad was an extreme disappointment.  I have had better Caesar Salads in the school cafeteria in junior high.  


When you are asked to pay $20 for a salad you would generally expect that some thought and some fine ingredients might find their way into the mix.  But no, not at this restaurant.  Again, I am not kidding when I say that my $20 Caesar Salad amounted to an 8 inch standard cereal bowl filled with Romaine lettuce chopped up cafeteria style, two small plastic containers of salad dressing made by some outside source, a few croutons and a disk of fried parmesan.  That was it.  I can do much better at home for under a dollar.  It was simply ridiculous and somebody at that Cafe should be embarrassed.  It was enough to ruin my dinner because after trying to eat that little mess, my appetite for the Best Fried Chicken entree was dashed.  


So, in closing, I would warn future diners to beware when looking at this menu and opting for Caesar Salad.  It was truly a joke...on me I am afraid.  I won't be returning there.  The following night we went to Planet Hollywood for a concert and ate a pre show light dinner at Cafe Hollywood.  What a difference!  The food was great and someone in their kitchen understood the making of a salad.  In the battle of the Cafe's, Americano lost miserably.",Bad,Bad,
"food rediculously expensive for what you get. $20 Bloody marys.
food average at best. way better to eat breakfast off property",Bad,,
"Everything at Caesar Palace is very expensive and I was looking for quality based on reputation.  $22 for clam chowder in a bread ball, no broth, just big pieces of sweet and raw potatoes.  Terrible for $$$.",Bad,,
"Loved the omelets and coffee. Excited to get sweet potatoes with my omelet. Service good. Expensive! $24 for an omelet, with coffee and tip you are looking at almost $40 for one person, breakfast!",,,Good
"We randomly selected Cafe Americano before a show due to it's proximity to the Box Office, and were pleasantly surpised. This was the first dinner we had that everyone in my family really enjoyed - not a single complaint! The service was good too. This will definitely be on our list of to-do's for every future Vegas trip.",Good,Good,Good
"Useful place to have basic breakfast food, so long as you are happy to pay for the privilege.  Service is OK . Fits in with the overall mediocrity",,Good,Good
We arrived after 1am and menu had just switched to a very few limited items. I luckily got in a last order of chips and salsa. We‚Äôve been to this restaurant more than ten times and have always enjoyed it. Service is always fast and friendly and food is high quality. We‚Äôll be back! 4 stars instead of 5 because prices are somewhat high.,Good,Good,Good
"Had breakfast here recently.  They handled the line quickly, and served us just as fast.  Good quality at a fair price.",Good,,Good
This restaurant is open 24 hours. The food is good and they have Good. This is a nice place to eat while taking a break from gambling.,Good,Good,Good
You would think that the managers of this restaurant would know that they get very busy at lunch when there are multiple conventions present.   They do not.  The poor wait staff is overwhelmed & harried.  The food was mediocre & expensive,Bad,,Bad
"The food was well prepared. The entire wait staff were attentive and very pleasant.The entire waitstaff made suggestions and answered questions. The environment is clean and bright. Price is on the high side, but good variety&presentation. Fresh fruit was was terrific.",Good,Good,Good
"Extremely over priced..bring a credit card or 5...I don‚Äôt mind paying for Good but it was typical diner food..$38. or $48. for steak and eggs...please...$6. for a soda that you couldn‚Äôt get refilled because the server is so into himself and gloating what a great server he is, he couldn‚Äôt find the time...won‚Äôt go again..",Bad,Bad,Bad
Ate twice at this establishment. It services guests 24/7 with no drop-off in service or food quality.,Good,Good,Good
"We had an amazing breakfast after a very long and early flight in. The service wasn‚Äôt the best, but it was also morning rush. The drinks were FANTASTIC",Good,,
We ate here twice for breakfast because it was so good! I got the Caf√© Americano breakfast sandwich. It was basically scrambled eggs with bacon and fontina cheese on toasted bread and a side of hashbrowns. Just be aware that the portions are ginormous! I actually got the same thing both days and ate half of the sandwich and half of the hashbrowns. You could easily split it with someone. Another order at our table was the pancakes. You get three REALLY big pancakes! No one was able to finish them. The service was really good both mornings we were there too!,Good,,Good
"We went to the Caf√© Americano in Caesar's Palace for New Year's Day breakfast.  There wasn't a problem getting in, but when there are 25 tables open in the restaurant and they sit you in the bar right in front of people are drinking and  whooping it up watching the football games so you can't even talk, then there's a problem.  The service was mediocre at best (the servers had too much celebrating the night before?).  Then the bill came.  $80 for eggs and 2 cups of coffee????  The worst part was that they charged $2 each for 2 half ramekins of so-so salsa that looked like tabasco.  And, $5 a cup for coffee?  This is by far NOT Starbucks.  This meal was nothing out of the ordinary or special--just eggs and toast.  With tip, I certainly couldn't justify spending $100 on breakfast.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"As we had come walking and entering the hotel in the evening, we did not want to go to starbucks again, so we went int Cafe Americano, I had some beers and my wife a cappuccino.
We were seated rather quick, served and attended very quick. I was not hungry but the menu offers a good variety of food for breakfast, lunch or dinner and is open 24 hours.
Price was fine and my hotel wifi worked perfectly well in there also, it is an open space. 
A good option for us for sure.",Good,Good,Good
Earlier in the day saw huge lines waiting to  get in so assumed the food must be good. Well you know what they say about assuming.Went for dinner about 7pm a table of 4 and were seated right away. Table was set but only one of us had a fork so asked for more. Our waiter arrived to take our orders no drink orders just food. Made our selections and were told we don't have that anymore...then why is it on the menu?? Over a half hour later food arrives still no forks and no drinks. Food was cold and tasteless. Would never return.,Bad,Bad,Bad
We give them a $15 tip on a $60 bill and charged it to our room. They scratched out the $15 and increased the tip to $60 on a $60 bill. Please ensure you take your receipt when leaving the restaurant,,,Bad
"We had dinner here 2 times during our stay. Everything is expensive in Las Vegas and so is this place around 20-25 dollars for a pizza or a burger with fries, but you need to travel far from the Strip to find lower prices with the same quality and service. 


The food tasted really good, the beers where great :) and the staff provided very good and friendly service. 


The wait times was awsome and we would deffinatly eat here again if we came to Vegas and stayed at Ceasars Palace.",Good,Good,Good
"the food is good a large menu.  The staff is what makes this restaurant, they are great.  It is always open and they have the best make you own bloody mary menu.  You just fill out a tab with what you want you Mary to have in it , there are many things to choose from, fun.",Good,,Good
"Well I've struggled with giving this place a fair review.  The food was VERY GOOD.  The service was ok...average...the prices are way HIGH ....but the location is fantastic.  It's up and down as I consider our visit there. 


4 of us ate before a show there at Caesar's and there was no wait and it was conveniently located in the front of the casino.  We each had vastly different items to eat.  We all loved our meals.  But the prices were high on everything there and the restaurant looks more like a common diner than a fancy, 4 or 5 star restaurant.  Ehhh",Good,Good,
Had a quick bite to eat before a show.  Wife got the wrong food. No refills drinks and it wasn‚Äôt even busy.,,,Bad
"Had dinner here as soon as I checked in to Caesar's. Very conveniently located and serves Good, loved my meat sandwich.",Good,Good,
"They do at least offer a-hour option, which isn't the case at all LV casinos anymore.  Food was good, breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  Location was convenient, sort of, by being in the lobby.  However that, along with the music volume too high, made it a very noisy place to eat.  At least the food was delivered quickly, so we didn't have to stay too long.",Good,Bad,Good
Convenient breakfast stop. We had  great food along with great service. Quick service. They offer a full all day long menu.,Good,Good,Good
Service was very good. Food was hot to the table .. portions are very large you can easily split with husband and wife...,Good,,Good
"I had scheduled a breakfast meeting here while at a conference.  The service was good, the food was good, but it the Cafe was understaffed and the the time to a table was very long.",Good,,
"I'm in Vegas alot, like every two weeks or once a month.  We stay at Caesar's Palace often too. We haven't been to the Cade Americano in awhile but we went in tonight. It was great.  We got two burgers, the classic and the BFE.  They were excellent and yes, pricey but oh so good. Also, we had a chopped salad and street chicken tacos, all were excellent. Then of course, we topped it off with a carrot cake, to share with us 4. Again, super yummy.  The beat was our water, Danny D, was excellent...thanks. well done.",Good,Good,Good
Located in Caesar's Palace.The food had good flavor and the service was good. I wish the menu had more choices. A little on the pricey side.,,Good,Good
great food for breakfast and other meals as well. open walls and feel part of the Las Vegas experience.  Small mason jars for orange juice was a memorable experience.,Good,Good,
"If you are a breakfast person, OMG this is the place to eat at Caesars. I have enjoyed everytime I eat there. I'm very anal about how I like my food prepared. Eggs over hard not runny or burnt and crispy bacon. Not every kichen can do that funny to say that wonder why? Oh well not an issue here, the rest of the menue looks great and I have also had lunch here too. They have a full bar, it's 5p.m. somewhere in the world. Will be returning to Caesars and definitly eating at Cafe Americano.",Good,Good,
We were attending a show in Caesar's and stopped in for a light meal. My daughter cannot stop raving over the guacamole (and she's from Texas). We loved the place and will be back for more formal dining as this was just a stop for snacks.,Good,Good,
"We had a brunch outside at the bar and it was very relaxing. Our bartender was very attentive but not at all pushy. I started with a Bloody ‚Äòmericano, which hit the spot. Then I ordered the beef nachos that were awesome! (See pic). They were extremely large and I could only eat about half of them. Plenty for two. My better half had a Cubano, which was also very good. This is a solid option if you are looking for an outside brunch.",Good,Good,Good
The food is okay. we have had breakfast and lunch here. You do get a large portion of what you order. There is just something about the cafe that i don't care for. I think it might be the decor and location in the hotel. It is not up to Caesar's standards.,Good,Bad,
"Cafe Americano is the spot for late night dining. Its open 24 hours and you cannot go wrong with a meal here. It is Good and service,",Good,Good,Good
We sat at the bar for service after waiting 5 mins the host asked if we wanted a menu. She walked past us 3 times with menus in hand n never gave us one. She then walked into the rest n never returned so we got up and left. Won't be going back very rude staff.,,Bad,Bad
What a great DEAL for the prices in Las Vegas! I was so skeptical about coming to this restaurant considering it's open 24 hours a day. In my mind - the food would be subpar - but BOY was I wrong. I got the salmon with quinoa and it was absolutely delectable. The portions were huge and the flavor was better than some of the other meals I had on the strip that week. We sat outside which is neighbors to the Absinthe show arena and a small outdoor bar which is apart of the restaurant in Caesar's :Palace. It was a quick walk to get to and quick to get in. The service was amazing and kept checking in on us to see if we wanted anything. We sat outside as opposed to inside to see the view and it was cute and cozy and private -ish for being on the strip! What a great deal and great prices and great food. I wish I could have gone back there again on my trip but time did not allot it! I was so happy with this! Would DEFINITELY recommend!!!!,Good,Good,Good
"We made our way to this spot one evening!  I was starving and was ready for some great food! That was when we met Danny! Danny has excellent customer service! We were seated immediately and our food came so fast we were back in the casino full and happy! Great customer service with good bar food in Vegas! Thanks Danny!! There is something on the menus for everyone except vegetarians FYI! The turkey sandwich I ordered was $23 bucks! That is standard pricing in casinos and buffets all around Vegas! Some can be even higher so bring money to burn for food unless your room has a full kitchen! The closest Whole Foods is in Henderson NV!  About 25 min drive from the strip FYI! We stayed at the Hilton at Lake Las Vegas so we could be closer to some organic food( only 15 minutes from the Hilton Lake Las Vegas), but while in the casino starving you have to filter the poisons when dinning out! There is no organic food sold anywhere on the Vegas strip. Thanks to all the employees of Cafe Americano for keeping the place clean and fresh for all travers!",,Good,Good
"This restaurant is an all time favorite for breakfast.  There are several different breakfast selections.  The eggs were always cooked as ordered.  The servers are friendly and very attentive.  The food is excellent whether having breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  If you are visiting Caesar‚Äôs this should be on your list to eat at while there.  Great breakfast and lunch spot.",Good,Good,Good
"This place is awful, starting with very slow to be seated (there were 15 empty tables and 8 couples to seat and too 15 minutes) and outrageous prices. 2 eggs over easy, hash browns and toast $21.00 , seriously. I had an egg white omelette for 25.00. Stark comparison to Hash-House a go go, where we ate the day before, I thought it was a little steep to pay $14.00 for hot cakes and eggs, then I saw the serving size, their portions feed 3 people. Go there instead, it‚Äôs across the street",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We ate here twice. The cakes - especially the carrot cake - are incredible. The staff will happily give you a doggy bag - the cake portions are large.


On our second visit we had breakfast. Surprisingly the portions were not large. We had OJ x 2, yogurt with fruit x 1, the American breakfast x 1 and coffee x 2 for $60 ex tip.",Good,,Good
"Stopped in for breakfast.  Ordered the Loaded Hash with egg.  It was so big, with hash browns, hash, bacon, peppers, onion, pork belly and a side of toast.  I couldn't even touch the toast, 2 could share this.  Guests ordered an omlette, and the other had the American breakfast, with eggs, sausage, and toast.  We all enjoyed our good and had a great experience.  It is open 24 hours, and came back later and had Chicken Tortilla Soup that was so fresh with lots of chicken and avocado to put on top.  Then had the New York Cheesecake, it had a nice thick crust, very creamy, the slice was round and topped with fresh fruit and whipped cream.  Two can split this for sure.  Excellent experience both visits.  Be sure to stop in.",Good,Good,
Had the small 2 for $24 (??) bites meal for lunch  - portion was pretty small.  Could've ordered a full size sandwich for about the same price and (what I saw on other tables) was a much larger size & would've been split btw two people much better.  The cocktails were delicious but once again - pretty pricey even for Vegas.  The quality of food/drink & service was good - great decor/atmosphere.  Would probably come back again after a late night since it's 24hrs and try something else,Good,Good,Good
Ate at Cafe Americano 3 times recently during my stay at Caesars in Vegas. The food is absolutely delicious and the service attentive and friendly. The portions are huge! Try the home fries consisting of white and sweet potatoes and the Denver Omelet. Very Yummy!,Good,Good,Good
"Unfortunately, for one who is allergic to eggs, the breakfast options are limited.  No lunch choices are available at breakfast.  I asked for a side of the corn beef hash and they would not accommodate my request.  Expensive for an average breakfast.",Bad,,Bad
"The food was good, servers were friendly and attentive, and a very relaxed casual atmosphere.  The cod was great!",Good,Good,Good
"Our waiter, Saul, was great.  He was humorous, knowledgeable, and friendly. 


The Mexican tortilla soup was absolutely delicious and had huge pieces of chicken breast - a winner!


The meatballs were very dense but the sauce was very flavorful.  


The salmon poke (and mixings) were very good however the rice was undercooked to the point of being crunchy. 


The lobster ravioli was under seasoned and lacked salt.  The onions were undercooked too. However, the mushrooms were absolutely perfect. 


My second martini was to dirty/salty.  It was returned and taken off of the tab.",,,Good
"The food was delicious.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.   I wish I ordered the fried chicken-- oh my, it was amazing on the bite someone shared with me. 


Service was very good too.


The bill for 4 people with tip was $175.00.  No alcohol or dessert... and two just had water to drink.",Good,Good,Good
"Great place. Good and friendly staff. Very tasty food, especially the burgers. Large portions and reasonably priced. What more could you ask for!",Good,Good,Good
"We found Cafe Americano in Caesars Palace after a late night of gambling. Their pizza was really good. Service was a little slow, but they were very busy, so understandable.",Good,,
"Not all of the casinos have a true 24-hour restaurant, so if you're planning to pull an all-nighter  on The Strip like we did, you'll want to plan ahead of time where to get something to eat when it gets to be 1 or 2 am and your body says ""feed me."" Even though it's not cheap, this restaurant/cafe right off the main check-in lobby at Caesar's Palace is a great choice. The long bar-side of the restaurant opens up to the lobby and has dozens of chairs along its length that promise Good from the bartenders (how is it that bartenders are almost always great servers even when they have to keep track of all the bar customers too) and also great people watching. The burgers are delicious, the chicken fingers above average, and the french fries are fantastic. They also pour a good stiff drink here.",Good,Good,Good
"I know that food in Vegas is expensive, but this is a casual restaurant and had to pay $67 dollars, including tip, for a breakfast! Now the food was delicious and the portions were large but that is too much for a normal breakfast for two people.",Bad,,
"Every time I stay at Caesars, we eat here about once a day. It is extremely convenient and there are so many options to try out. The breakfast is amazing. $30 for pancakes is insane yes, but the pancakes are huge and can easily be shared! Service is great. I would recommend the pancakes, brisket nachos, and chicken sandwich.",Good,Good,Good
"After teaching all day at Caesars was hoping for a simple dinner and then some rest.  Thought I would try Cafe Americano.  Did a very simple order, a glass of wine and a pizza.  I actually had my food before I got my glass of wine.  Then discovered the crust of the pizza was burned black, tasted terrible.  Staff agreed to get me another pizza, which took a bit.  Good thing is the pizza tasted ok.  Waited a very, very long time to get my bill.  Then the server actually brought me a bill for both pizzas!!!  Upon request it was fixed.  Staff was unwilling to even offer me any kind of concession, dollars off bill or another glass of wine.


Very disappointing service level.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Good selection of food.  Very accessible and centralized location.  The staff are very attentive and courteous.,Good,Good,Good
"Restaurant is a very good place to eat, really close to our rooms and have very nice choice of breakfast items.",Good,Good,Good
Sandwiches were big! 1 order is enough for two people and they split our fries too!  So yummy!! Customer service was excellent!,Good,Good,Good
Went there twice good pizza for a late night snack and went there for breakfast and food was great . Huge amount of food  and the price is reasonable.,Good,,
"Stopped here to place a togo order. I got a burger and my wife got the chicken finger/fries. Both meals were good...$42. 


The chicken fingers very large, and made for a nice late night snack.   They are open 24/7 so if you get hungry late they have what you need.",Good,Good,
Lunch while attending conference. Service was excellent. Not wait to get a table; drinks and food arrived promptly. Amazing quinoa salad.,Good,,Good
"Dear Saul (The amazing waiter),


You recommended the Clam Chowder. And in all my travels, even Seattle Washington itself... i have never had Clam chowder THAT AMAZING. I am a foodie at heartx food is a passion to be enjoyed not just consumed. And the Clam Chowder at Cafe Americano can only be described as Orgasmic. It gave me goosebumps with every bite. The broth is so flavorful, the fresh herbs added on top with the cripy fried bacon pieces gives it some bite and crunch. The whole baby clams, pieces of red and sweet potatoes gives it a noce rustic feel. Hands down... I will be having this again before i leave Legas. Saul... you are very knowledgeable about your menu and I can not thank you enough for an out of body experience. 


Sincerely Tiffany Hall",Good,Good,Good
"Tuna salad was good. Aperol Spritz could have been better. 


The waiter brought wrong order, then changed it immediately.


The ingredients were fresh, but nothing special in terms of seasoning.",Good,,Good
"The food was good, though there are not a lot of choices.  The service was very slow.  We were there around 9:00 pm and it took almost 30 minutes from the time we sat down until we got our food and it was not busy at all.",Good,,Bad
The spaghetti and meatballs taste like they are from a can. The half chicken is a small portion. It is very overpriced and the quality is not there. Caesars Palace should be embarrassed.,Bad,Bad,
An easy dinner here- located in the lobby so you don't need to go outside.  Good - not great .  The Cheesecake for desert was VERY good.,Good,Good,
"I had lunch, my wife had breakfast. Both were great! Portions were better than expected. Our server Fernando was great, very attentive.",Good,,Good
"Why did the tourist cross the Strip?  To see what restaurants were on the other side.  Originally was going to the new Gordon Ramsey place in front of Cesar‚Äôs Palace.  But new place and lost of people waiting to get in.  So pass on that.  I saw the Cafe Americano and figured I would see what they have to offer.  


The selection is good.  But after the fried bologna sandwich at Toby Keith‚Äôs the night before, I was trying for ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù. So I had the Chicken Tortilla Soup and the Quinoa salad.  Word the wise, the soup and an appetizer would have been enough.  The Salad was huge (as was the bowl of soup).  But I was in no hurry, so I sat at the bar, and ate most of it.


The Tortilla soup had some serious pieces of chicken in it.  The flavor was good.  The salad was very tasty too.  But I am sitting at the bar, and getting a second beer was like pulling teeth.  I was a little surprised.  Two bartenders on a Wednesday nigh and both of them just kept walking by me.  I was a little surprised.  But it was a good meal and the people watching from the bar was interesting",Good,Good,Bad
"Went for a meal around 11:00 am on 9/1 when they were just switching to lunch. Our son is a vegetarian and asked if they can do eggs Benedict since their menu had a limited selection for him. The female server said that they spread switched to lunch. We asked if she could ask the kitchen if it is still possible to get it since at that point it was 11:15 and we can see breakfast plates still coming out. She insisted that it is a hard rule and the answer is no. I hadn‚Äôt seen my son for a few months and wanted him to have a good meal there, so I quietly said, ‚Äúif possible, please it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to al, can you please ask?‚Äù  She acted like she understood and I thought she would, so we stayed. At 11:30, the table next to us got egg Benedict; unfortunately we also found out that our service never bothered to ask the kitchen, manager, or anyone and decided to be judge and jury. 
My son settled for a salad, but we felt dismissed and were treated very coldly by this server. To make matters worse, she asks us at the end if everything was to our satisfaction, and none of us answered as we didn‚Äôt know if she is clueless or digging the knife in deeper. We have eaten here four or five times in the last two years, and I believe that we encountered this server the last time and should‚Äôve known better.  
We made a couple of mistakes, first we should‚Äôve left when we realized that she didn‚Äôt ask the kitchen or manager. Second, we should have asked for manager to ask. I fail to understand why it would be impossible to order a breakfast item within few minutes from the timeline!  In the end, what made the experience worse is the server‚Äôs attitude of total disregard.  We will never return to this place again; it is expensive and our service was insulting! 


The waitress is somewhat taller maybe 5.8- 5.10, has dark hair that she wore up, and served the area by the windows. I‚Äôm adding this in hope that some manager would read this and have a discussion with her about customer service and how a little kindness goes a long way! She will probably dismiss that as well, but we can only hope that she may find some care in her heart  otherwise, please spare other people and relieve her from m her duties.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I had breakfast on Monday, Aug. 27 inside Caesar's Palace at their coffee shop for breakfast and lunch, Caf√© Americano. I felt that Caesar's embodied the finest of everything under its roof. Boy was I wrong! The server took my order after twice telling me it would be just a moment while he did something for another table and the wait to just place my order and get an ice tea was beyond reasonable. When this middle-age male server brought my ice tea finally I asked him if he could bring some sugar packets - there was no such on the table. He never did. After about ten minutes of waiting I had to get up (and I am north of 60 and don't walk as well as I used to) and go up to the bar and stand and wait there to get the bartender's attention and ask him for sugar packets. When my food arrived by a different server who delivered it, I asked her if she could please bring me some butter for the very dry looking toast. She said of course. The butter never came and by the time I saw my original server was ice cold. The final insult to injury came when the bill arrived. I used my Harrah's Total Rewards points to pay for the meal. The server immediately informed me that the points do not cover sales tax and I would have to pay that in cash, plus his tip. Not knowing any better I said ok and did so. (My bacon and eggs with an ice tea was almost $30!) Later in the day I stopped at a Total Rewards counter in Harrah's and asked about sales tax. They told me there is no sales tax because I used points and no tax is ever charged. I realized at that point I had likely been hustled by the server to increase his tip a bit. This is a great example of how you can't always put trust in the name brand!",Bad,Bad,Bad
The food is too expensive for its quality and amount. Don't order any drinks unless you know their costs. Menu doesn't list the amount or the cost for orange juice & others.,Bad,,
"The prices at this restaurant are OUTRAGEOUS! The food is mediocre, the servers indifferent, and the prices are obscene. I ordered a glass of orange juice and it was $8.00 for less than 4 ounces---no wonder the prices of the drinks are not on the menu. AVOID eating here as there are a lot better restaurants at Caesars than this one.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Every year my husband and I stay in Las Vegas for a week and having eaten breakfast at many restaurants we finally settled on Cafe Americano. It‚Äôs a great restaurant with a brilliant breakfast menu, something for everyone to eat, from yummy fluffy pancakes to a full breakfast.. even a good few healthy options! We love to sit in Maggie‚Äôs section, she is warm and funny and very efficient but on her days off Eric S is our server!",Good,Good,Good
Great Place to test authentic American Food as well as Continental. The ambience is too good & service is Swift,Good,Good,Good
"Located near the hotel's reception, this reasonably priced ( for this hotel) restaurant is open 24 hours. 
We were shown to a table without waiting in line and greeted by our friendly server who Immediately procured coffee for us. Our breakfasts arrived quickly. The food was excellent, freshly cooked, piping hot, tasty and set us up for the day.
Very happy to recommend this restaurant.",Good,Good,Good
My husband and I ate here every morning  while staying at Caesar's and were never disappointed.  My favorite was the Huevos Rancheros and my husband loved the Waffle.,Good,Good,
"We stopped in here for a late night snack while visiting Las Vegas.


The service was relatively slow, the prices were very high ($18 for chicken fingers, $16 for a small order of potstickers‚Ä¶), and the food was just ok.  


Granted, you're paying for the convenience of being right there in the lobby.  But I'm sure they're also charging more for the late night partiers, heading back to their rooms, and needing for something to eat at any cost.


If you really need to eat something late night, and can't get to anywhere else, this will be a good option, but be prepared to pay for it.",,,Bad
"Recently went there to have lunch,  there was many open tables but still had to wait 15 minutes before being seated servers very very good.  
The complaint is the prices of food!
1 bowl of clam chowder was around $20 and Mahi tuna was closer to $40.00 not including drinks.  
So bill was nearer to $70+ not including tip.  Sorry to say the prices are ridiculous. 
If you want Good at reasonable price don't go there!",Bad,,Good
"We enjoyed this lovely (and very busy!) cafe for breakfast on two mornings during our stay at Caesar's Palace.  I ordered the ""Continental"", (which looked like a work of art!).  It had a small Danish pastry, coffee cake, yogurt, fresh currents and plums and blood oranges and figs (my favorite!).  My companion ordered the 'Bacon Bacon Biscuit' and it was enormous and delicious.  The coffee was superb, too!",Good,Good,
"Cafe Americano located inside Caesars Palace across from the lobby and is open 24 hrs. I had eggs ,bacon,potatoes and toast for $23. It was a bit pricey for breakfast even though it was good. If you're up late or early morning and don't want to leave the hotel then this place is fine other wise their are plenty of cheaper options elsewhere.",Good,,
"Time here: 3PM.  Rarely do I write a poor review, but we ate here...  very pricey for the amount of food you receive; a tradtional breakfast plate was $25.  We had a party of nine.  NO KIDS MENU.  Pancakes came to our table that were not ordered.  Daughter's Cesar salad had more dressing than salad.  My shrimp tacos were low on taste (the coleslaw was tasteless).  The turkey club sandwich was ordered without aioli sauce which came with it.  We had to ask for refills of our drinks.  SUMMARY: An expensive small MEH meal with below average service.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The bar of this Cafe has awesome bartenders that make very good drinks! I had an improvised mix drink that tasted super good, fruity and balanced taste of rum.",Good,Good,Good
My friends and I ate here while in Las Vegas. I had a great Denver omelette and my friends enjoyed their tacos . Definitely recommend !,Good,Good,
"For several years now, this place has been our ‚Äúgo to‚Äù spot when staying in our near Caesar‚Äôs.   This trip, however, was the first time we tried their amazing (but pricey) breakfast.  Waiter was great and the parade of food coming out to tables looked amazing.  The $8 for a 6-8oz orange juice was a bit insulting (and as far as ‚Äúfresh squeezed‚Äù goes I‚Äôve had better for sure).  Otherwise, we were quite satisfied.  After leaving the absurd food court pizza place, we found that Cafe Americana offered great pizza, at a slightly cheaper price, and in a comfortable environment.   But I love this place.   It‚Äôs expensive but hits the mark.   I don‚Äôt remember (about a decade ago) a restaurant in its place (or the same restaurant before remodeling) offered a killer wedge salad I no longer see on the menu.  Bummer.",Good,Good,Good
"Located off the front lobby of Caesars, Cafe Americano was easily found and accessed. We (my wife and I) dropped in around 7:30 on a Monday evening for a light dinner....many open tables. We found the number of selections to be adequate for our interests. Cocktails (Caipririnna & Absolute Miami Martini) were solid, though perhaps a bit small in volume. We consumed the drinks as we shared an appetizer of guacamole and chips. Huge serving of creamy, yet chunky, guacamole with warm light crisp chips. After such a big filling appetizer, we were glad that we  had decided to share three chicken tacos, which were also of good size, and contained ample fresh fillings. 
Server Danny was SUPERB....timely, knowledgeable re: menu items, helpful, pleasant, personable....quite an asset to the restaurant. Prices reasonable for food, though perhaps a bit much for the cocktails. We would certainly return.",Good,Good,Good
"My wife and I are in Vegas for the week and are staying at Caesar's Palace.  The morning after we arrived, we wanted to grab a quick breakfast/brunch and get on with our day.  We noticed the Cafe' Americano just off of the main check-in lobby as we were heading to our room, so we decided to give it a try.  We didn't want a buffet and we didn't want to hike all aver the place considering other options.


It was Saturday, so the restaurant was fairly busy.  They had empty tables, but there was a very short line waiting (maybe 3 in front of us and one was a group of about 8-10, so they wouldn't be competing for a table for 2).  Still, we had to wait almost 10 minutes to be seated.  There were at least 2 hostesses.  They were standing around chatting and looking at their phones.  They should have been checking the restaurant for available seating and getting people to their seats.


Finally, a third person appeared at the hostess station and asked, ""How many?""  She motioned to us and we were seated.  It seamed to me that, from what I could see, we should have been seated right away and the 2 hostesses at the front station shouldn't be there.  They didn't do anything useful the entire time we were in the restaurant.


Our waiter appeared quickly and took our drink order.  Drinks arrived quickly and we made our food order.  My wife ordered a Fritata, and I got a steak and eggs breakfast bowl.  It came with hash brown, so I asked if they could be ""scattered and done"".  The waiter looked at me as if I has asked him to leap out of a window.  (Hash browns are a shredded potato cake that is frequently served browned on the outside and almost entirely uncooked on the inside.  ""Scattered and done"" is requesting that the potato cake be broken up and all of the potatoes allowed to cook until brown). Clearly, our server didn't know what that was.


When our food arrived, I found my potatoes to be an unpleasant mushy texture.  One taste was enough.  The eggs were fine and the steak was OK.  However, the wheat toast was perfect!


My wife said her fritata was OK.  I thought it looked very bland.  When it came, she asked for some salsa.  Salsa is very good with eggs.  Again, waiter looked at us like he had not idea what we were asking for.  He brought her some ranchero sauce (which is not the same thing).  Then I found an additional $2 charge on my bill for the ranchero sauce.  I've never have a restaurant charge me extra for a common condiment.  This one did.


The food didn't kill us or make us sick, but that's probably the best thing I can say about our experience.  The bill for a fritata, a steak bowl (with about 2-3 ounces or 65-85 grams of steak), a cup of coffee, and a glass of water came to just about $50 US with tip.


I won't ever go to the Cafe' Americano in Caesar's Palace again and I don't recommend that you try it.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Serves a good range of American Italian food. Good atmosphere located near the main lobby of Caesars Palace. The cafe is not part of Caesar's Group, so you can charge yr bill to your room. You have to pay separately.",Good,Good,
"Though we didn‚Äôt arrive for the
main breakfast offerings, we had a pretty ordinary American breakfast:  3 eggs, chrisp bacon, whole wheat and gluten-free toast and hashbrowns.  The wait staff was efficient and friendly.  We had to wait for a second cup of coffee however, and recalled the days when a full pot of coffee was offered at the table.  Overall enjoyable, but much too expensive and servings a bit too large for my liking.",,Good,Good
The food was a bit better than average. The service was good. Late night kind of place with a crowd.,Good,Good,Good
This is a great breakfast place but it‚Äôs also a great place to hang out at the bar and watch the hustle and bustle. The bartenders are professionals. Tayton was excellent at both mixology and menu recommendations. The $6 cup of velvety coffee sounds steep until you find out you can come back and get free refills all day long. We had a late night bite to eat and ended up hanging out enjoying the atmosphere. Excellent menu choices not just breakfast items. Open 24 hours.,Good,Good,Good
Great for breakfast. Whenever we stay at Caesars Palace we mostly dine at Cafe Americano for breakfast. The service is great and they get you in and out quickly if you are in hurry. We never wait long for food even during peak hours. Highly recommend for breakfast!,Good,Good,Good
We had breakfast and lunches along with late night breakfast foods with great adult drinks. Bartender and staff are very friendly and accommodating.,Good,,Good
"Breakfast was disappointing, ordered eggs benedict, English muffin so tough you couldn't cut it. ham was so thin you couldn't pick it up with a fork. Fruit was good.",Bad,,
We are staying at Caesars Palace and asked where we could get a normal toast and eggs breakfast. The Cafe Americano was suggested so we gave them a try. The food was good but the service was slow mostly because they were understaffed. I am used to a breakfast for 2 people to cost around 20 to 25 dollars. We paid over twice that. I guess you have to expect that at a casino resort.,Good,,Bad
Hangover burger was delicious from the buttery brioche bun to the crispy pork belly and jalape√±o crisps!  Prices are ridiculous for this restaurant but this burger is a winner!,Good,,
"My wife and I ate here for dinner. I had the lobster ravioli and it was good. I can't say the food and service were mind blowing but they were good. I think the price ($90) for dinner for two was a little over priced, but I would return here again.",Good,,
"$35 for dry fried chicken, and no bread for the table (despite it being late) was disappointing.  Service was very good, as our server went to go find some bread from earlier in the night for us (I was starving and had low blood sugar).  But the food itself was an easy pass.  I usually finish my plate but left this one half full.  Gave it another shot late at night, wings were good, but again the main dish was forgettable (literally - I don't remember what I ate).",Bad,Bad,Good
"Great people watching from the bar.  We had sandwiches and tacos, everything was delicious.  Bar service was good.  Our only complaint is that they wouldn‚Äôt sit us at a table and we had to sit on barstools while we ate and watched the Golden Knights.",Good,Good,Good

The servers were great and very attentive.  I ordered the basic breakfast with eggs, bacon and hashbrowns and it was done perfectly.  My husband got the hash and said it was the best hash he had ever had before.  It's pricey in here but I don't mind paying a lot to eat out if it's good quality like this place.  Our server even put our refilled drinks in to go cups so we could take them to the pool.  Great experience all around at this place!",Good,Good,Good
"This restaurant has great food that is ruined by the obnoxious morning noise.........But there is nowhere else to sit down and have breakfast at Caesars Palace.  Best to order up room service or brave the extreme noise. Music, tv, people it is really loud.",Good,Bad,
"Ordered continental breakfast and bagel a la carte.  Out of chicken and apple sausage.  Came on wooden tray with: blueberries, grapes, blackberries, plum slices, blood orange slices and figs, along with two small Danish pastries and orange marmalade.  Bagel was fine for LV.  Service reasonably quick for a Sunday morning.  Menu looked good.  Very busy location.",Good,,Good
Excellent Cafe is lobby of Caesars. service was great. servers are very friendly and heplful. highlt recommned,Good,Good,Good
"Blueberry waffle and fried chicken.  Waffle was greasy, yet also really dry.  Bacon inside waffle was the only thing that was done well.  Chicken was two very small legs, overcooked to make the meat hard.  Covered with Onions, that were very strong.  Onion does not go with this meal, another garnish would have been better.  Even parsley would work.  Cost was outlandish for something Waffle House does better for much less.  Service took over 10 minutes and two requests to get syrup.",Bad,,Bad
Breakfast fit for a king. Nice service super food and we had 14 people with 9 children. The were able to accommodate us quickly and everyone was totally satisfied when we departed.,Good,Good,Good
We had breakfast here 2 days. The portion size is HUGE! My husband and I shared meals both times which helps cut down on food costs. We had the Denver Omelet one day and the Breakfast Burrito the other. I could not finish my half either day and my husband could not finish his half of the burrito. They were both VERY good. The service was great!,Good,Good,Good
The happy hour tacos are the way to go! $3 during happy hour and $17 normally. The Shrimp tacos with the fried avacdo with a Corona!,Good,,
Food is good and is open 24 hours. It is quite expensive (as are most restaurants at the hotel) and service is good but relaxed - not in a hurry to turn over tables which is good or bad depending on if you are trying to get a table or already sitting at one.,Good,,Good
"if your a smoker this place isn't for you but if you love great chicken wings i strongly suggest a visit!
great staff and the perfect place to watch the world go by!
a must try without breaking the bank!!",Good,Good,Good
"Must experience the best service for a sit down relaxing meal..
And our waiter Juan sure enjoyed providing us everything we could ask for..",Good,,Good
"We dined there 3 times, as the food was great and the service was excellent.Restaurant had a varied menu and every meal there was great.",Good,,Good
We don't recommend this place due to the quality of food and expensive prices. For a simple spaghetti dinner with lack of taste and fish tacos for 2 people and 3 beers was $75 and could of made the spaghetti at home much better.,Bad,,
"Had breakfast here and it was excellent.  The service was very good.  They are open 24 hours.  They are a bit pricey, but worth it as the food quality is very good.",Good,Good,Good
"We had a short business trip to Las Vegas ‚Äúshoe horned‚Äù into an otherwise full schedule in May, and stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Palace, where the meetings were being held. I had booked our evening dining, and decided to keep the restaurants all on-property, just for the ease.


Breakfast was open, and as we are just not ‚Äúbuffet people,‚Äù it almost looked like we were going to be out of luck. I stumbled upon Caf√© Americano in the Caesar‚Äôs Palace literature, and we decided to give it a try. Neither of us was holding out much home that it would be a really good choice, but were we ever wrong!


On our first visit, we asked about sitting at the bar, outside, since it was such a nice morning, and were promptly seated there. It appeared that there were two entrances, one from the exterior front of Caesar‚Äôs Palace, and the other from inside the lobby restaurant part. We had entered via the interior route, and did have to look for the hostess. I noticed, on my visits, that a separate hostess was almost always on duty, at the exterior entrance. At least we did get to walk through the interior portion, but for two days, always sat outside at the bar.


We got our breakfast menus promptly, and ordered, while I looked over the wine list. Unfortunately, our meals took much longer than anticipated. As my wife‚Äôs first meeting approached, we inquired, and were informed that the food would be arriving soon. It did not, until my wife had to leave.


Our bartender refused to charge for her meal, as it did take an inordinately long time. While there were many diners (mostly inside), the large venue was not nearly full. I insisted that we be charged, but that request was politely refused. OK, I would just add some Prosecco, feast on both plates, and entertain myself, while my wife did her business duties.


With the slow delivery from the kitchen not withstanding, I have to say that all other service was excellent. The bartender was friendly, and efficient ‚Äì if he had been running the kitchen, that order would have been out in minutes!


As I had no plans, other than to find wine during the day, I hung around, and just found the wine there. The wine list did not take very long, before I had it fully memorized. In addition to my Sellina di Notte NV Prosecco, I had the J Lohr Riverstone Arroyo Seco ‚Äò15 Chardonnay, then the Meiomi Central Coast ‚Äò14 Pinot Noir, and ended with the Roth Estate Sonoma ‚Äò14 Merlot. Heck, I had nowhere to be, and all day to get there.


The breakfast consisted of:
Brooklyn Breakfast Sandwich w/ scrambled eggs, country ham & Swiss cheese on a brioche bun, including home fries ‚Äì very good breakfast sandwich
Omelet w/ Swiss Cheese and hash browns ‚Äì quite tasty, and though I do not see that listed on the main menu, it had to be available, for my wife to order it


Then, I came back the next day. I slept in a bit, and wife headed off to her early morning meetings. As we were flying out that afternoon, I had lunch, a bit early. Our bartender was working again, so I started with the Prosecco, while contemplating lunch. Finally, I settled on the Smokehouse Burger w/ BBQ sauce, pulled bacon and aged white cheddar, including crispy onion strings ‚Äì very good burger, but a bit messy. I was not a fan of those onion strings, but that is just life.


I added the Sonoma Cutrer Russian River Valley ‚Äò15 Chardonnay, the Justin Paso Robles Cabernet Sauvignon ‚Äò14, and the Robert Mondavi Napa Cabernet Sauvignon ‚Äò14. The bartender added a light pour of the Zolo Reserva Malbec ‚Äò13, and the Kenwood Yulpa Sonoma Cabernet Sauvignon ‚Äò14. Somehow, I think that there were a few more ‚Äúlight pours,‚Äù but was not taking coherent notes by then.


While the food was good, the service was even better. The venue is nice, open and with some interesting views. The only glitch was the delivery of that first breakfast, but then we were not charged for my wife‚Äôs dish, under protest.


While inside might have been nice, this al fresco bar was ideal, considering the weather. Other than a bit broader wine list, for B-T-G, I could not have asked for more. While not quite up to some of the finer (and more expensive) breakfast restaurants (off-property), all was very good, and slip-ups do happen.",Good,Good,Good
Expensive for breakfast. No surprises here except the white toast was tough. Never experienced that before. Possibly microwaved to re-heat? Large portions.,Bad,,
"Can only rate the breakfast but I highly recommend this restaurant.  I eat breakfast there on every visit.  Good, fair prices and quick service.",Good,,Good
BIG SHOUT OUT TO SAUL - when you go to Cafe Americano make sure you ask for Saul and you have to try the fish and chips!!!,Good,,Good
"Enjoyed a great breakfast, (we had  the Brooklyn Breakfast Sandwhich and American Breakfast) that was prepared very well with great service.  However, we thought it was overpriced.",Good,,Good
"The service was pleasant and breakfast came out fast but wasn't anything special.  Typical on-strip gouging for every $.  Gatorade at Caesars is $5 for a 20-oz bottle too!  I don't mind paying more on the strip, but like they say on ESPN, C'Mon Man!",Bad,,Good
I had the American Breakfast ‚Äî more then I needed but very good. The service  & seating was quick. This is a big place ‚Äîlots Of places to sit with different views.,Good,Good,Good
"Enjoy breakfast here, the eggs Benedict were delicious and the blueberry pancakes were among the best! Service was a little slow getting going but got better once they started. Would certainly come back!",Good,Good,
"Cafe Americano is one of my favorite places to eat.  Their loaded hash with pork belly is something I look forward to. The servers are great, helpful and friendly and quick.  Eric S is super and I look forward to coming again this visit. The lobster ravioli is fantastic as well.",Good,Good,Good
"We rented a cabana at Caesars and were pleasantly surprised when the staff told us we could have lunch/drinks from anywhere on the property, including Starbucks.  They even admitted that it would probably be better than the food from the Snackus Maximus by the pool.


We ordered burgers and fries from Cafe Americano. Although slightly less than hot when they arrived, that was understandable. I had the California burger which had a delicious Jalapeno relish with avocado on it. I could only finish half, and really struggled as I wanted to eat the whole thing! My friend ate all of his Classic burger and also declared it delicious. Expensive of course, for burgers, but everything is in LV. They were cheaper than our cocktails, however!


The Cafe is open 24/7 and is a much better choice than the disappointing Caesars Food Court.",Good,Good,
We ordered the All-American breakfast and we had plenty to eat.  The service by the wait staff was the best we have ever had.,Good,,Good
"The food was good, but not great for the price. Excellent service and atmosphere.   Serving sizes are huge.",Good,Good,Good
After 10:00 the Cafe turns into a very short order diner. Problem is that the menu from here is the same that is able to be ordered from room service.,,,
There were four of us at a table.  We could not hear each other over the ambient noise.  Food was average.  Prices very expensive.,Bad,Bad,
"This restaurant is Top Notch for a good breakfast. The waffles with fresh fruit are wonderful, and they are served with real butter and maple syrup. The egg and meat plates are very good too. Service was excellent. Highly recommended.",Good,,Good
"Average offerings for breakfast with large price tag for nothing special...house potatoes were good but other than that, could have eaten same thing for half the price at most eatery's.",Good,,
"I've eaten here a fair few times now, normally at the beginning or end of an annual industry convention at Caesar's, but have never been less than impressed with the quality of food and experience on offer.


The blackened maki tacos in particular are a favourite.


There's a great selection of beers and cocktails, all served in a relaxing and friendly (and - unusually for this part of The Strip - genially outside) environment.


Service is always attentive and friendly, adding to a never less than enjoyable experience.",Good,Good,Good
We enjoyed the American Breakfast every morning--food was great and fast and pleasant service.  Also serves lunch and dinner.,Good,Good,Good
The service here is top notch and the food very good. I like the different choices of food. The atmosphere is good as well.  Will visit again.,Good,Good,Good
Exhausted after flight etc-stopped here for a quick bite- yes-prices a bit high- but you re in Las Vegas- the chicken and avacado salad is perhaps the best salad I‚Äôve ever had-husband had spaghetti and meatballs-told ahead  that sauce has red pepper flavor- which was fine but a nice touch to explain- meal came out lukewarm but was immediately rectified- good meal- server friendly and attentive-,Good,,Good
"My wife and I stopped here for lunch one afternoon.  The staff was very polite. 
I ordered the fried chicken sandwich which was delicious. I had a side salad which was average.  My wife ordered the chopped salad which she loved.  
The food is pricey but is was good.",Good,,Good
"Food is excellent and portions large.  Like all restaurants at Caesars, Cafe Americano is a bit pricey.  For about $15 more you can get the full Bacchanal Buffet, but we weren't that hungry.",Good,,
"Thank goodness this place is open 24 hours! It was the only place I could find that served a full meal late at night. It was delicious! But the food was expensive, and the drink was $15 for a smaller than average sized glass. There is a bar there as well, and the service was lovely! The waiters were really speedy and nice to interact with.",Good,,Good
The lobster roll sandwich and the caprese salad were the BEST and the most bang for the buck!  There were just so many items to choose from.,Good,,
As above ! Expensive and poor quality. Ordered eggs and got cold stodge. Sent back ! no better received .,Bad,,
"We stayed at Caesar's Palace and Cafe Americano is connected off the lobby. Both of us enjoyed a nice lunch on the patio. The service was prompt, friendly and attentive.The food was very good - good quality ingredients prepared with care. Prices were typical for Las Vegas strip, so probably a little high compared to home but the same, or even a good value, compared to other restaurants of similar calibre on the Strip.",Good,,Good
"Unfortunately it was closed due to stove breakdown ,We were disappointed as it's a sit down family restaurant that's not high priced and close to front lobby so easy for breakfast before heading out for the day",,,
"I ordered blackened mahi tacos, but has some kind of fried gooey indescribable thing. Our beers were  $11 each.",Bad,,
"Situated just left of the main Caesar‚Äôs Palace foyer. Excellent outdoor area for a drink. ‚ÄúJess‚Äù our waitress, provided excellent and friendly service. She really seemed to enjoy her job. Maybe she just liked the Aussie accents !! The food was also exceptional. A particular mention of the pizza, burgers, and chicken wings - thoroughly enjoyable at 2am, after a big drink.",Good,Good,Good
This is a cost effective restaurant with Good for Vegas. The price is right and open 24 hours a day. Nice bar tenders and servers. Food was OK - burger was a bit boring but yummy fries and calimari. Friend had the chicken tortilla soup which was yummy and the meat balls were HUGE! Overall good value for money.,Good,Good,Good
The Classic Burger is awesome.  BUT....sit outside as you can't hear yourself think inside.  Extremely loud music.,Good,Bad,
"A quiet setting with a central location near the hotel registration desk/concierge area. Great food, service, and delicious Lavazza coffee!",Good,Good,Good
"Went for breakfast.  The waffles were not very good but everything else was (eggs, omelette, chicken, etc).  Coffee was very good.  Service was as would expect.  


It was very pricey for breakfast as entrees alone were about $25.   Food above average but many other places offer better food and a more reasonable cost.  


In the future, I would eat elsewhere.  If cost doesn‚Äôt matter, then the food was good.",,,Good
"Good and great coffee if you are up at 3:00 a.m. enjoying the Vegas lifestyle!
Food and drinks available 24 hours with professional service.",Good,Good,Good
"The breakfast was top notch.  However, breakfast for two with a small orange juice ($8), bacon and eggs, hash browns, toast, and coffee will set you back over $80 with tip.  Also, although Caesars advertises that Caf√© Americano is open 24 hours, it actually opens at 7 AM.  We found that Caesars also has Pronto by Giada serving a lighter breakfast at more reasonable prices.",Good,,
"We had breakfast and a late dinner at the Cafe.  The food is delicious, the service staff friendly and efficient.  It is expensive but that is expected since it is so convenient if you are staying at the hotel.",Good,,Good
"Portions are large enough to share. Food was very good, wait staff friendly. Enjoyed breakfast and lunch there.",Good,Good,Good
"great place for breakfast and a light lunch , we also enjoyed a drink outside , bar or tables available",Good,Good,
"I was a little shocked by the prices but due to an injury I couldn't go very far to eat.  I was pleasantly surprised with the food!  Breakfast meal was huge (too much food but delicious!).  Since there's no way to save and reheat food in the room, it felt like a waste!   Lunch (salad and tacos) was amazing!  Dinner (mac n cheese) was so good that I can still remember what it tastes like!   Very friendly staff!  Fun place to people watch as well. :)",Good,Good,Good
"Only giving it 4 stars because food was tasty but the cost was not worth it.
The only meal we had here was breakfast. Food was good but very pricey. Cost $70 for two of us for eggs, meat, toast, and hashbrowns. Oh yea.....small orange juice...$7 and coffee $5.50. That is crazy expensive. Go to any buffet and pay less and eat all you want with a bigger variety.",Bad,,
"Had breakfast twice. Food was very good and menu selection was broad enough to appeal to every taste. The service was excellent and our servers were friendly and helpful. A little pricey at $50-$60 for breakfast for 2 people, but that seems to be the going rate at the Strip hotels.
Would certainly go back again.",Good,Good,Good
"Was looking for a late night meal that was good, reasonable, close the hotel and not overly priced.  Found Cafe Americano and was not disappointed. Food was good, hot, fresh and service was attentive but not over bearing. They stay open late, may be 24 hours not sure?  


Price was around $15.00 for each plate of homemade sliders, hamburgers, fish etc.
see pictures for what we had


will eat here again if near by in Vegas",Good,Good,Good
"The selection is limited and all options were for LARGE orders. There was no a la carte pricing. I asked if I could just order 2 eggs and toast. Sure. The eggs were fine, and the toast was sandwich type bread. That's OK too. The eggs were $6, not sooo bad, but the generic toast, 2 slices, was $8. This was bad. Had I known I would have gone out or just had a pastry, which is what I did the next morning.",Bad,,
"Very good, convenient and nice select in the hotel.  Can get crowded,  go early to avoid but no reservations needed. Sitting outside was nice for breakfast, staff are great",Good,Good,Good
"Ordered a pizza to go, the bartender say he was from New York and that this pizza was better, umm, not!  It was awful!  First they gave me the wrong pizza and said that‚Äôs what I ordered, no, not what I ordered!  Had to wait another 20minutes for another one, no big deal!  Get to my room, took 2 bites and threw it away!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Do not eat at this joint.  It is very convenient to stop in but what a rip off, we ate here twice, first time for breakfast, and it was so bad I sent my egg sandwich back, the second time was for a super quick bite, soup and wings.  The food is OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive.  RIPOFF.  Common Caesars, show a bit more class.",Bad,Bad,
The food was great.  American with a twist.  There are big potions - enough for 2 people.  Service was fairly quick,Good,,Good
"I was at venue for a conference, and just wanted a real breakfast (e.g. eggs) before it started.  Food court didn't seem to have any such thing, so OK I'll try the ""casual"" Ceasar's restaurant.


$23 for an omlette!  With dry potatoes.


Waitstaff seemed nice enough, but all the jellys (for the toast) were opened and used.  Just off putting for the price.",Bad,,Good
"A really good place to go for casual drinks and dining.  The bartenders are awesome.  Basic casual food, apps and sandwiches.",Good,Good,Good
"What we expected was a mediocre restaurant with ok food and what we got was a really pleasant experience -


We had the guacamole and it was fresh and tasty.  Then we had the tacos - really good.


The only con was the volume of the music - a very noisy place Richard off the lobby of caesars.",Good,Bad,
"This can be found inside Caesar's Palace.  Has a comfortable patio area for dining and a bar outside.  You can see Hell's Kitchen nearby while dining, for those interested. 


Portions are large. Our only experiences were for breakfast.  I think it was called the American burrito with avocado sauce which i HIGHLY RECOMMEND and HIGHLY RECOMMEND SHARING. It's delicious but too much for one person!


Great tasting coffee hereüëç",Good,Good,
"If you're looking for great food and great service in a comfortable and casual atmosphere, this place is for you.",Good,Good,Good
Anyplace in Caesars has Good.  Cafe Americano has Good at a relatively affordable price.  I ate there twice and felt good about my choice both times.,Good,,
"My husband and I spent two nights at Caesars Palace. When we went looking for a place to eat, we were drawn to Cafe Americano. We enjoyed our meal there so much on the first night that we returned there for our second night's meal. We had the same server each night, Silvano, and he was delightful.


The interior of the restaurant is really non-descript. There was nothing visually that really set off, but there was nothing offensive about it either.


On our first night, my husband ordered the smokehouse burger, and had his choice of a small salad or fries; he opted for the salad. I ordered a chicken and avocado salad and a bar drink. My husband really liked  his burger, and my salad was delicious! The chicken breast tasted like it had been marinated, and there must have been half an avocado topping the salad. For what it cost, the bar drink was a very stingy pour. The restaurant is currently promoting Taco Tuesdays, and we were there on a Tuesday. Had I noticed the flyer on our table, or had our server brought the special to our attention, I would have ordered from the Taco Tuesday menu.


Having enjoyed our meals, we returned the next night. I was still in the mood for tacos, and was able to order them from the regular menu, not the special menu, for twice the price. I chose the short rib tacos, and found them disappointing. I'd have been more tolerant of them if I had paid the Taco Tuesday price. 


My husband's meatball sandwich was kind of weird. He was expecting a few medium-sized meatballs on an Italian roll with melted mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce. Instead, the meat on the sandwich resembled and tasted like slices of meatloaf. Fresh mozzarella was used, resulting in firm disks of melted cheese rather than the melted mozzarella one would typically expect on such a sandwich. He chose fries instead of a salad, and they were barely warm.


As I said in the title of my review, it depends on what you order. Our first nights meals were very good, but had we ordered the second night's menu items the first night we were there, we would not have returned.",,,
"MY wife and I were there for breakfast last week and we wanted something that we can share since we were aware that their portions were ""shareable"" from the last time we were there. We ordered the BLT not aware that there was over 1.5 lbs. of thick cut bacon in the sandwich! In addition, the ""T"" (tomatoes) were the green fried variety! The waitress was also very sharp - since we told her that we were going to share it  she had it prepared and had the sandwich cut in half and our own portion of fired serves with the half sandwich...needless to say - it was fabulous! If you are there you need to order this sandwich!",Good,Good,Good
They serve breakfast 24 hrs a day. We had lunch of the Philly cheesesteak with chicken. We asked them to split it and glad we did. It was hugh plus you get more fries. Very scrumptious. We saw people with breakfast dishes and they were large also. Highly recommend this place.,Good,Good,
"We stayed at Ceasar's Palace and enjoyed the ease of heading over to Cafe Americano to dine.  The staff were professional and extremely polite.  My husband said his jalepeno burger was one of the best he's ever had.  I ordered the chicken avocado salad and found the chicken was not seasoned at all.  But overall, the meal was very enjoyable.",Good,Good,Good
"The best breakfast stop. They are a very attentive and friendly staff. The food was perfect, cappuccino was perfect and the service was perfect. Not much else I can say.",Good,Good,Good
"I travels to Las Vegas from 1-25 to 1-30-18 had a great time and visited Caf√© Americano several times during my stay. Food was served fast, hot and fresh and delicious. I would recommend this for breakfast lunch or a late night snack.",Good,Good,
"Stopped in for an inexpensive dinner before the Celine Dion Show. Celine canceled due to illness but that did not spoil the evening because the staff at Caf√© Americano were so fabulous. The food is good - nothing fancy or pretentious.  Very satisfying food at a good price. Everyone we encountered was just plain nice to us. How satisfying after continued poor treatment at Paris.  I added pepper to my eggs and there was a large hole in the shaker and a ton of pepper poured out.  The manager stopped by all tables to ask how the meal was, and I told her about the pepper - I asked her to remove it so no one else would have this experience. She did so nicely and then offered to get me a new egg - I declined because I had so much food and did not need another egg. She then insisted on buying my husband's beer.  Which she removed from the bill.  How nice was that?  Everyone asked how things were. The waiter was prompt. Drinks arrived quickly. Food was good.  We could not have asked for a better experience.",Good,Good,Good
"Expensive for the quality of the food!! There are much more reasonable places to eat near by!!  Peggy S from MNstayed Jan 18-22, 2018",Bad,,
"Had a breakfast business meeting.  Casual atmosphere, great service.  Located in the main lobby/registration area of Caesars.  I had a waffle with blue berries and whipped cream.  Nicely prepared and tasty.  Coffee was good and OJ was fresh squeezed.  The other breakfast items looked quite good",Good,Good,Good
I was very disappointed in Cafe Americano. It was the only restaurant on the Caesar‚Äôs property that served mediocre food.,Bad,Bad,
We went to to Cafe Americano 3 times in our 5 day stay in Caesars - 2 for breakfast and 1 dinner.  All were very good although I would most strongly recommend their breakfast.  Small but strong menu.  My wife and I shared/split all meals because portions are very large.  We had the garden eggs benedict which had tomato and veggies on a hearty english muffin with perfectly poached and runny eggs with beautiful hollandaise accompanied with crispy hash browns.  How anyone could eat the full meal themselves I'm not sure (and I'm a big guy).  For dinner we had blackened mahi-mahi with Israeli couscous.  Delicious.  They also have a full drink menu for all meals with a decent wine list.,Good,,
"We were looking for a snack around 8pm and didn't know where the food court was so we stopped here on way to our room.  Not many people and menu was quite high priced for our budget so we ordered breakfast.  Sausage was hard and uncooked, hash browns were old and coffee was lousy.  Went to Denny's the next day and got a much better meal at half the price.  Americano was $50 for two as opposed to $21.50 at Denny's.  I guess being close is not the best.",Bad,Bad,
"We enjoyed breakfast 2 mornings.....and were delighted with our meals! Servings were very large...and our food was delicious!
Belgium Waffle was great, as was the American Breakfast and the 3 meat Omelet!
Servers were very attentive and very good. There were 8 of us!",Good,,Good
"We stopped by Caf√© Americano for pre-drinks on our way to Absinthe (which is right outside). We didn't eat but sat at the bar facing the lobby to order some drinks.


Terrific attentive service and chat from the bar tenders and a great atmosphere. We really enjoyed the short time we spent here.


Although we didn't get the chance to try it, the food looked SO GOOD. Hope to get the chance to go back and try some soon!",,Good,Good
"Cafe Americano is conveniently located steps from the hotel registration. I had an excellent burger my friend had a very decent ravioli. Cocktails are fine too. Prices are steep though.
Make sure you have time: service is slow.",Good,Good,Bad
"Say you‚Äôve been there before, they gave us a free app! And it was really good...(during lunch) friendly service. Large portions.",Good,,Good
"The best server I ever had in my life is Nick! I had to come twice in the same day! Even though I can eat free and drink free I would rather pay for this Nick (lol) ! Ask for Nick and maximize your experience here!! Always a great place, but Nick ‚Äúmakes‚Äù you come back!!!",Good,Good,Good
"We find ourselves eating here every time we visit Caesar's Palace as it is one of the only places open.  The service is good and the food is fine, but prices are high for what you get.",,,Good

"Try signature cocktails, 4 potato clam chowder, short rib nachos, fritatta and waflles.  Everything is amazing.",Good,,
"We were looking for a quick breakfast and chose to eat here based on convenience since we were staying at Caesars. It was very expensive for a small breakfast and neither of us were thrilled with the food quality. I had the Brooklyn breakfast sandwich and my wife had the eggs benedict. The main meals were ok, nothing special, but the hash browns we each had were so greasy we couldn‚Äôt eat them. The coffee was good if you think Starbucks is too strong and they even gave me a to go cup.  found way cheaper and better quality breakfast spots during our stay, I‚Äôd pass on this place in the future.",Bad,,
"Great place to have breakfast when you are staying at Caesars.  Promptly seated, service was great and attentive.  Food was excellent, with my wife and I having the eggs benedict, which was a treat.",Good,Good,Good

"We have been coming to Caesars Palace as a family for 28 years.  A few years back this spot was named Michaels and I ripped, I mean wrote a review about our experiences.  On this year's visit I was happy to hear that the business was no longer owned by the same people.  Word had gotten out that it was a poorly run establishment.  That's why folks, these reviews are important. Anyway, our fist dinner on the 27th, our waiter was Saul and he couldn't have been any easier to work with. We had split checks and my family is the type that likes to get a side  of this and a side of that.  He handled it well I called the manager over to let her know how happy our party of 12 was. The manager was thrilled and I am sorry I forgot her name. A few of us got the fish and chops and they were delicious.  It is expensive but when you have a server as good as Saul, you don't seem to mind. 


Went back for breakfast the next morning and the breakfast was awesome.  Everyone raved about how great the food tasted, but again, the server, this time Raul did an awesome job.  Kudos to the management staff for creating a bright spot at Caesar's Palace.",Good,Good,Good

"Business breakfast meeting, good central location in the hotel.  Music a bit too loud, but all else well done. I was surprised to see a very delicious yogurt, berries and granola.  Toast was prepared to our request.  My colleagues had more traditional egg dishes, all looked good.  Service was good.",Good,Bad,Good
"This spot inside of Caeser's is one of my favorites in Vegas for breakfast, lunch or a late meal. The servings are big enough for the most hearty appetite and the quality is always excellent. This time we had the beef short rib nachos and they were spectacular. We didn't need to order entrees, but we did anyway. I had a Cuban sandwich that was right out of South Beach. I've never had better and I lived in south Florida.  
You really cannot go wrong in this place. Prices are a little steep but in line for the quantity and quality. If you are being comped, let it rip and you will not be disappointing.",Good,Good,
Enjoyed breakfast at Caf√© Americano. My wife and I split a traditional breakfast plate which was very good. Highly recommend but pricey,Good,Good,
"The egg meals are all 3 eggs  - so by the time you add meat, hashbrowns and toast it is quite a plate-full of food.",Good,,
"Right off of main lobby, you can eat inside, outside, or at the bar. Food is good, service is attentive. The Belgian Waffle I had came as three halves with berries, was super light in texture and crispy outside, but tender inside. One of the best I have had.",Good,,Good
My wife and I sat outside in the sun in December and had a very good lunch.   My wife had a salmon salad and I had the short rib tacos.  Both were excellent.  The music was good.  The drinks and meal were expensive as most were on the strip.  The construction atmosphere was not very desirable around the outside tables but at least we were outside.,Good,,
"Love the ambiance and the food. It is pricey, but the quality was great.  The menu has a lot of choices. Good for vegetarians too.",Good,Good,
"Ate Breakfast here.  It came out so FAST which made us happy.  GREAT wait staff. Delicious Food.  A bit noisy, but it was packed as it is so good.",Good,Bad,Good
"Very very pricey for breakfast.  We didn‚Äôt get anything fancy.  I got an omelette that was good.  My wife got eggs, potato‚Äôs, bacon and roast.  The eggs were cooked too long.  We both got coffee.  Over $70 for breakfast.  Like my title said not again.",Bad,Bad,
We had breakfast here. It was just fair. Service was very good so that made up for the food. I would choose some other places there were some great reviews for other food places but we did not have a long stay just 2 nights.,,,Good
"We ordered the traditional breakfast and the eggs Benedict, with a few sides. While these meals would have been just the right amount at restaurants near home, there was too much to finish here for either of us. It was delicious and extremely well-prepared, but there was no way we could finish everything. There was a short wait to get a table, but the food and service were well worth it.",Good,,Good
"If staying at Caesars this is fairly convenient for breakfast or a quick bite for dinner. The food was good and the service was excellent, however, we did feel that for what it was, the food was rather pricey. 2 people for breakfast one morning was close to $90 with tax and the tip which we thought was a bit steep! The staff are fab though and very attentive, even during busy times",Bad,Good,Good
Best breakfast ever!  So much food we could share amongst the table and still had plenty left.  Service was outstanding throughout the day!,Good,Good,Good
"We wanted something quick after traveling all day and didn't feel like looking around- this was located right in the lobby.  I had spaghetti and my husband had a burger.  I think both were around $25 each.  He had 2 beers and I only had water.  Including tip, we spent almost $100 for this average quality cafe meal.  Not wanting to spend that much on a quick meal, we would find somewhere else to go next time.",Bad,,
We stop here for this sandwich every time we come to Vegas. Sit at the bar. Always the same always great.,Good,Good,
"We were staying at Caesars and had breakfast here each morning. the food and service were great. it was hearty food, offering a broad choice with the time between ordering and being served minutes!!!! The table service was first class, nothing was too much to ask and all the staff were really keen to help.",Good,,Good
"I eat here twice during my stay at ceased hotel back in sep 2017. They are open 24 hours so there that convenience. Food was ok, nothing special here. Normal bar food, ok service and friendly staff.",Good,,Good
"Happy hour is fun and good! If you are in the area, you should try it.  It is really fun and tasty. The service is quick and friendly.",Good,Good,Good
"This place is perfect when you need a bite but are not ""Going Out"" - in the lobby of Caesar's Palace, the food comes out quick and is pretty good.  The Breakfast Sandwich was fantastic !",Good,Good,Good
"I spent $100 for 2 kids and an adult, we had a Pizza, BLT and a salad, 2 apple juice and a Diet Coke ( my Coke was not refilled and I was finished it before I got my food) felt because I had two kids they didn't want me.  It wasn't busy while we were there.",Good,,
Very expensive---but after all it is in CAESARS---you pay to say it.  The service folks are very attentive yes----but at $3.00 for each egg I guess they should be---killer bacon however on the American breakfast,Bad,,Good
"I had the meatball sandwich and side salad, while my companion had the All American breakfast.  The breakfast was serviceable, although the hash browns had an odd taste to them.  The meatball sandwich was cold, with congealed cheese and a very soggy bun,  This sandwich was the most unpleasant thing I had the entire trip.  The server never mentioned the fact that I took a total of two bites out of the sandwich.  I assume the service staff is used to patrons not finishing their horrible food.  There are much better restaurants to eat at in Las Vegas.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"There's nothing wrong with this place, but the menu is a bit different. Check it out before being seated. My continental breakfast had lots of fruit, but 2/3 that were out of the ordinary.  There were two sweet danish/ pastries, but no plain toast, roll , or croissant. The jam was excellent, but nothing to put it on.  The yogurt was just a shot glass size serving, more of a garnish than the protein of the meal. The service is good, the prices on the high size for some things.",,,Good
We had a good meal here on a recent trip to Las Vegas. I had the spaghetti and meat ball (one huge meatball) and it was very good.,Good,,
We do not mind paying a little more for Good. Had omelette at $24 each and I can bet every casino chip I have that it was not cooked by a chef. Has browns were full of oil and potatoes hard. And if you advertise freshly squeezed orange juice please do not serve it from a Carton. So so disappointed. Avoid,Bad,Bad,
"We ate breakfast here the first day in Vegas. We ordered the All American with an extra side of sausage. It was plenty for the two of us. The food was good and quick, and the service here is exceptional!!",Good,,Good
Nice open atmosphere  24-hr bar & grill located by the main entrance & registration desk of Caesars Palace.  The BBQ Short Rib Nachos were so delicious we ate them twice during our 4 day trip.  The serving is HUGE.  One order fed 3 very hungry adults.  The second time we even had leftovers.  Serve was fast & friendly.  We were going to order 2 plates the first time but the waiter was kind enough to tell us one would be plenty.  We thought $24.00 to fed three people was an exceptional deal.,Good,Good,Good
I stopped in here to grab a bite at dinner time. Sat at the bar and Andrew was my Bartender and server. It was actually the best service i have received while in vegas. I travel to vegas 6 plus times per year so I have tried alot of restaurants and in general i feel the service in Vegas has been declining but not at Cafe Americano,,,Good
Nice but limited menu.  Ate there 3 times during out stay due to being able to sit outside. The menu has a nice variely and the staff is extremmely service oriented.,Good,,Good
"Cost of basic breakfast way to expensive, bacon overcooked and eggs undercooked the service was very good but that's all.",Bad,,Good
"Had breakfast there. Over $65.00 for two people.  Orange juice came in a small pint(?) sized mason jar, $8.00.   However, the food was very good.",,,
"We ate breakfast here almost every morning.  If you get there around 7 am, it won't be busy.  They have good coffee, great breakfast choices which are on the larger side.  Two of us split an egg white omelette that comes with hash browns and toast.  If you tell the waiter that you are splitting it, they will split it for you on 2 dishes (very nice!).


This location is very convenient if you are staying in the Augustus or Octavius tower.  It's right near the lobby and provides a little break from the casino and smoke.",Good,Good,Good
"The food is good, I had the roasted chicken and a side salad. 
My waiter (Saul) was animated, fun and interesting. He took the time to provide suggestions and offer information about the menu, the food arrived quickly and the staff was attentive. 


Overall, this meal was tasty and mid- level price. A nice change in a city where the lights can often hide quality chefs.",Good,Good,Good
We went here on a Monday morning at 11 so we just missed the full breakfast menu. The breakfast sandwich was delicious but the Bloody Mary was far below the standard that was advertised. Our main reason we choose this place was because they bragged about how good their Bloody Mary was. Barely any flavor other than tomato juice. The only accoutrements in there drink we're two olives.,Bad,,
"This restaurant in the lobby of Caesar‚Äôs Palace was awesome. Service was top notch, and food was delicious. Prices were expensive, yes. But we found that everywhere in Vegas. Coffee was soooo good here. Highly recommend this restaurant!",Good,Good,Good
Service was solid.  Mac and Cheese was good.  Cuban sandwich was dry and not very flavorful.  60$ for Mac and Cheese and a sandwich seems on the expensive side but would have been acceptable had the sandwich been better.,Good,,Good
"The food is excellent, the service is excellent, and the coffee is excellent. Every time I am in Las Vegas I eat at this caf√©. The price may be a little higher than other restaurants but it is worth it.",Good,Good,Good
"Weak Service... drink its ok and very expensive, but Bartender didn‚Äôt give proper attention. We got out not knowing why we didn‚Äôt receive a better attention. House was kind of empty.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"My fianc√© and I recently visited during our vacation to Las Vegas. We enjoyed it so much we went twice! The first day we went for lunch and I had the shrimp tacos which were incredible! We then returned a few days later for breakfast, and WOW! The portions made the plates looks small. We each had pancakes and bacon and could only finish half! Four huge pancakes on each plate which were absolutely wonderful! I would highly recommend!",Good,Good,
This is opposite the front desk of Caesars Palace. The food is fresh and delightful. Fernando was a wonderful server and explained all of the great aspects of the food.,Good,Good,Good
We decided to stop here and get something to eat before going to bed. This restaurant is located inside Caesars Palace. Close the the Augustus Tower and it‚Äôs open 24 hrs.  We were seated right away. The server came and took our order. My hubby wanted breakfast but I wanted something different. I asked what she suggested and she mentioned the Shrimp Tacos. I went with it. They were amazing!  My hubby loved his breakfast meal. He also ordered a Bloody Mary. We had a Good. Service was good. Everyone was friendly. Food was great but this place was pricey like every other restaurant in Las Vegas.,Good,Good,Good
"Choose the Cafe Americano for breakfast on the last day of a business trip to Vegas.  It is a large restaurant and bar located right off the main lobby of Caesars.  I was greeted warmly and seated immediately with a server with hot coffee showing up in less than a minute.  I passed on the coffee  opting for water and began looking over the menu.  There is no buffet at this restaurant only off the menu ordering.  After closing my jaw after seeing the pricing I choose the Denver Omelet with hash browns and an English Muffin.  The food came out promptly and was as good as you could expect for the a breakfast meal.  The omelet was good size with the right amount of filling but nothing to convince me that this $24 breakfast was anything to write home about.  No razzle dazzle fruit display or WOW educing garnish just an omelet with potatoes and bread.


The upsides are that the location was convenient, the place was very clean and the servers pleasant especially for so early in the morning.  I just could not get passed $24 for breakfast.  


If you go you will have Good delivered by a motivated crew just plan to spend a bit to get a run of the mill meal.",Good,Good,Good
We basically just came here out of convenience for breakfast as we were staying in the hotel. The menu was decent but definitely priced for tourists. Portions were big and the food was good but drinks were mediocre. Our bill was $125 for three breakfast items and 3 bloody marys. Yikes! The drinks were lackluster- $15 for a bloody mary with unimpressive garnishes and a gross balsamic glaze that ruined the flavour of the drink. The service was good at least. Not amazing but not horrible.,Bad,Good,Good
"This restaurant is just inside the main door of Caesars Palace across from the check-in. It's open 24 hours. Stopped for lunch after picking up  tickets to see Celine Dion and was immediately seated. My server, Jessica was very helpful with the menu because it was hard to read with white print on orange background in places. Ordered Skinny Chicken which is a bowl with quinoa mixed with cucumbers, avocado, cherry tomatoes with a grilled chicken breast on top covered by mango and a few greens for $29. This was a very healthy choice but the chicken was extremely dry and barely edible.. Ordered iced tea for $6 making my total check $37.89 with tax. What a nice surprise they had Stevia on the table. Found the service to be very good and helpful but frankly thought for the size and quality of this meal, it was tremendously overpriced.",Bad,Good,Good
Is open 24 hours and the breakfast is complete . You can eat meat or italian food and good wines for a low cost .,Good,Good,
"The Caf√© Americana is a large restaurant located in the lobby of Caesars Palace.  It is also conveniently located near the main entrance to this giant hotel.  Caesars Palace is located on the west side of the Strip just north of the Bellagio and south of the Mirage. Across the street are the Linq and the Flamingo hotels.  This restaurant is open 24 hours a day and 365 days a year.  Caf√© Americana is independently owned and is not owned by Caesars Palace but I still got reward points since I charged the bill to my room.


I ate breakfast here on a Friday morning in late July and thought both the food and service were great. I had to wait 5 -10 minutes for a table to open up as it was kind of busy.  I ordered an omelet with a couple of sides and a cup of coffee. The server was great and when I told him I wanted a heart healthy breakfast he helped me order and made sure I got the fruit cup instead of hash browns and an egg white omelet instead of a regular omelet.   It was not a cheap breakfast as I paid $5.50 for the cup of coffee and $23 for the omelet.  I really enjoyed the cheese omelet as it was very tasty and the fruit was VERY fresh (yum).


Overall I thought both my server and my breakfast were great. If you are staying at Caesars Palace I recommend that you eat breakfast here at least once. My only complaint was the high prices but that is pretty normal for restaurants on the Strip.",Good,Good,Good
"Great location and bar, average menu.  Ate breakfast 2 times when staying at Caesars.  First time, hung over and just had oatmeal and toast which was just enough. Second time looked over menu and not impressed, had eggs benedict, it was good but you are paying for a huge portion of food that only a 300 lb. football player could eat!  Service was very good, and the girls that seat you work very hard to get you to a table quickly.",,Good,Good
This restaurant is fairly standard including the menu.  No complaints - just don't expect anything fancy.,,,
My experience here really neither good or bad. It‚Äôs just ‚Äúbla‚Äù really. I wouldn‚Äôt mind eating here if I had no option. no real identity and food tasted bland.,Bad,,
"This is your typical in hotel caf√©.   For an omelette, OJ and tip its $38.  Other than for the convenience its not worth it.",Bad,Good,
"Servings are huge, but one breakfast burrito and two sodas = $50.00. One small, tiny Bloody Mary $13.00. The location is handy, but be prepared to pay for it.",Good,Good,
"We were tired from the trip and wanted someplace nice to sit and eat. Cafe Americano was perfect and our meal was delicious.  Our waitress, Breanna was very attentive. We will definitely return.",Good,Good,Good
"Stopped in for a quick bite before the Absynthe Show.  Clam chowder was very very good, the waiter split is for us. We ordered a pizza but didnt have time to eat it, so they held it for us until after the show.  Great service",Good,,Good
We were looking for food at around midnight and decided to sit in the outdoor area at Cafe Americano. The waiters were all very efficient and made sure we always had drinks topped up etc. We had a pizza each and it came very quickly.,Good,,Good
"Good. Expensive food. Let me rephrase that, expensive low quality food. My fries were burnt and my sandwich was dry. Food was cold when it arrived. The wait staff was nice though and kept our water glasses full. Had to ask for our bill, but it was busy.",Bad,,Good
But boy!!!very expensive! 6 glasses of chardonnay wine and 2 portions of fries for $97.For God's sake!!!,Bad,,
Great food here! Waiter was excellent and came out quickly. Prices were high...$24 for a sandwich with french fries and $6.00 for a glass of soda.,Good,,Good
"Don't expect much here except for a hefty bill.  Our breakfasts were not done to our liking really.  Eggs were runny, potatoes ordered well done, were not, and coffee was really strong.",Bad,Bad,
"This is not the same restaurant that I came to at Caesars palace two decades ago.  The Chicken sausage was miserable.  Guess what the waiter said when I complained?   ""I don't like chicken sausage.""   Now that was helpful...   Not!   The chicken sausage was like eating cardboard.   I'm serious!   You don't believe me, just waste $9.00 and order it.  3 patties of horribleness.  And I love chicken sausage. 
Also, I drink my coffee black.  That means I taste nothing but the coffee.  I asked the waiter what kind of coffee they served, because what I had in my cup was awful.  He told me that I probably got ""older"" coffee and he would make a fresh batch and bring me a cup from that.  Well he did, and indeed the coffee tasted totally different.  So lesson here, request ""fresh"" cup of coffee.",Bad,Bad,Bad
A late dinner for my wife and I.  My wife enjoyed her Baby Beet and Salmon Salad and my $20 Hawaiian Pizza was marginal at best.  Definitely not worth $20.  I'm sure the resort casino is banking on the captive audience to keep diners in the resort so they feel they can charge prices higher than what they should be especially for dishes like this.,Good,,
"I had read the reviews going into the restaurant and wasn't expecting too much. Yes, my breakfast was costly but it's at the entrance of Caesars! I got the American breakfast and everything tasted fresh and was well seasoned. The service was very attentive and if my water got low other servers helped keep it full. My server, Alex, was carrying quite a few tables but never missed a beat in keeping me posted on my drinks (mimosa and coffee) and food. I would definitely eat here again should I return to Caesars.",Good,Good,Good
I foolishly assumed that the caesar salad would be decent in a place in this building. Watery and limp.,Bad,,
"Passed by this spot a couple of times when in Vegas. Decided to try it for a late breakfast. They told me they were not serving breakfast anymore but I could still order some eggs and toast. Well, 2 fried eggs and 3 slices of cheap white bread.... Payed $14 bucks ($8 for 2 fried eggs and $6 for some piece of cheap looking and tasting white bread), not counting on tip and taxes! Insane! Ended up paying around $20. 
In general the staff is nice and the location is good but....pricey pricey pricey for what they have to offer..",Bad,Good,Good
Overpriced for a caf√©. Ended up ordering short rib nachos for the family and they were watery and the flavor was not on point. They were bad enough I mentioned it to the water and the mgr took it off the bill.,Bad,,
"Just like the title says stopped here for a few of the happy hour appetizers before going to a show. 


Enjoyed the food and saw some other very good looking food. Service was good too!",Good,Good,Good
"It's hard to find a place that meets the expectations of 5 adults and a teenager with different tastes.  My whole family was impressed with Caf√© Americano.  I had the mushroom ravioli, best I've ever had.  Order the spaghetti and meatball for a laugh, although it is very tasty too.  Beef nachos, mac and cheese, and burger and fries were some of the other dishes ordered and all of it was 5 star.  Glad we went to Caf√© Americano!",Good,Good,
"My wife got the B.L.T. that was loaded with bacon and had a small slice of hard, tasteless green fried tomato. While she asked for mayo, it looked like they scraped it off after they put it on the bread.  My turkey and ham after requesting none, had mayo on it; however, it was so little if I had not seen it I would not have known.  The $6 a glass iced tea was overflowing with ice. and it was hard to get the server to fill it up.",Bad,,Bad
We are here ordering the chicken macn cheese and a classic burger the food was fantastic. When we entered we were seated straight away and promptly seen to by our server Jordan who was fantastic. It is a little expensive but that's Vegas. With the restaurant being directly across from check in and also having a bar with large screens it is great,Good,Good,Good
The cafe is at the entrance in the lobby at Ceasars and is open 24/7. The shrimp appetizer was absolutely the best. It is perfecty fried shrimp mixed with fried alvacado chunks. Iknow it sounds wiered but you have to give it a shot.,Good,Good,
"We are in town for a few days, and we usually eat here once a day. Today, we ate here twice! Breakfast and a late night ""snack"". Breakfast was amazing, the portions were huge. Glad we shared a couple of things. Tonight we had pizza, burgers, wings and fries. Everything was great. Service was great both times. It is pricey - but hey, it is Caesar's! We'll be back!",Good,Good,Good
Excellent food and Good.  We observed other people enjoying pizzas and hamburgers and they looked delicious and did not observe anyone complaining.  Its open 24 hours 7 days a week which is a plus.,Good,Good,Good
We love having breakfast here. Wonderful food and service.  Prices are not cheap but they have real hash browns and that is a must for us.  My wife loves their oatmeal.,Good,,Good
"Staying at Caesars?  This place is in the lobby (and 24/7).  Breakfast was good, service was ok.  Try the Brooklyn Breakfast sandwich.",Good,Good,Good
"I was very disappointed at this restaurant.  I couldn't even get a garden salad, as they didn't have that.  I asked for chicken without any sauce and they couldn't do that.  They were unaccommodating.  I ended up sitting there eating nothing while my husband got a burger.  Would not recommend this place to anyone.  There plenty of other wonderful places to eat.",,Bad,Bad
Initially we went because of the large breakfast menu posted online. Upon arrival we found the menu to be much more limited than expected. We didn't let that stop us from finding some delicious items!  We each ordered a different salad - each unique and delicious. I had the fried green tomato caprese salad. Delicious!  Definitely enjoyed it more that I expected since the menu was more limited than I anticipated. Would not hesitate to return!,Good,Good,
"My wife and I decided to eat at the Cafe Americano in Caesars one evening. We had not problem being seated as the restuarant was not very busy. The prices on the menu were moderate to high. They had a fairly good variety of food selection including breakfast, lunch and dinner and they were open 24hrs. We both ordered a hamburger and french fries and my wife orderd a bowl of clam chowder. I was a little stunned when I saw how large the hamburger was and when you added the fixings and the bun, there was not way for me to eat it until I cut it in half. The burger was cooked exactly the way we requested and the fries were pipping hot. My wife said that her clam chowder was excellent. The restaurant was very nice and the service was excellent.",Good,Good,Good
"I have eaten here on previous stays at Caesars, but I learned two new things this past week.  First, the staff is very willing to switch out sides.  For example, I do not like breakfast potatoes, so I was able to get a delicious bowl of fresh fruit instead at no additional cost.  Secondly, since it was late and I was tired, I decided to have dinner here.  The steak was as good as the ones I had at the high end steakhouses.  So very tender and perfectly done to my taste!  If you are staying in the Augustus Tower, you should consider dining here because the restaurant is close, the food is delicious, it is reasonably priced, and there is usually no wait!  I ate here about 6 times over the week, and had great food and service each time.",Good,Good,Good
After splurging two nights in a row we opted for cafe americano for more casual and little cheaper.  Hotel is located in ceasers lobby but food was great. Very hearty filling food.  Son loved meatball sandwich and I hade spaghettini and meatbal which was huge.  Garlic bread is a must.   Totally surprised us for being so good and little easier on the wallet,Good,Good,
"For years I've been going to Caf√© American (previously Central) for breakfast.   We've always liked the food and the huge portions which we split.  Last weekend we needed to go out for a quick dinner and though Caf√© Americano would be a good choice. 


My wife ordered the Fish and Chips after seeing it on another patron's plate.  While it was a huge portion it seemed to lack the flavor of the fish and chips you get at the Gordon Ramsey's Pub.  My organic chicken dish was very good, with just the right amount of well-done roasted onions in a mushroom sauce.  As always, I ordered the better dish!


Service was spotty.  My wife ordered a blue berry martini that didn't arrive until shortly before the food.  He server blamed it on the bar; however, both the bar and restaurant were pretty empty. Other employees did a good job.


Caf√© Americano is a good choice for breakfast, but with all the great restaurants in Caesars you'd be better served going someplace else!",Good,,Bad
"We had an okay meal at this place bit nothing special..
We tried the chicken strips and the burger.  The fries were crunchy and well seasoned",Good,,
"Located right in the lobby of Caesar's Palace, it's a perfect location for breakfast before heading out to the strip or a late night cocktail before heading to bed.",,Good,
"We ate here several times during our stay as the service was great, the food was wonderful and the prices reasonable. Loved our waiter Brian- had him multiple days.",Good,Good,Good
"My husband and I stayed at Caesar's Palace and were wonderfully surprised with this great restaurant!  Food was incredible and service was exceptional.  I typically don't recommend ""hotel"" restaurants, but this one is an exception.  Loved it!",Good,Good,Good
$63. for breakfast for 2  ?!? Try the Linc Hash restaurant across the street. Worth the walk from Caesars. Also part of Harrah's Entertainment.,Bad,,
"First morning we were there we had breakfast at Caf√© Americano
I had pancakes (2), side of bacon, coffee and a Bloody Mary.  My wife had Eggs Benedict and coffee ... $90.00 breakfast
Food was very good (I loved the bacon) and the service was friendly and efficient 


Went back on our last morning there and had the Corned Beef Hash.  It was home made and very good.  If you are going to do breakfast here I would highly recommend this item",Good,,Good
Our flight got in late and we stopped here as soon as we got to the hotel. Great variety and it was all really good. Always being open made this a great option too after partying all night,Good,Good,
First restaurant as I stumbled out of my room. Had Corned beef hash for breakfast. It was very good or I was very hungover and needed food. Be prepared though it was very pricy$$$$ My bill was $35 American dollars ($600 Canadian)  Servers are quick and very friendly.,Good,,Good
"We stayed at Caesars Palace while in Vegas and stopped in at the Cafe Americano for breakfast. I ordered the All American Breakfast ($22.00) and got 3 fried eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast. My wife got a bagel and fruit bowl, of course we got coffee and juice. For breakfast this place and all others in Vegas are real proud of there food. Now it was good, but it's breakfast. Total on the breakfast bill was $45+ tip. It was convenient because it was in the hotel we stayed, but you can do better at other places. The restaurant was not all that clean, we were seated next to a curtain along a wall that had dried food on it. Service was good, very polite and on top of things. Save some money and eat at somewhere else cheaper.",Good,Bad,Good
"Great 24 hour option. Ordered fish tacos as a late night snack & returned for breakfast & order corned beef hash, delicious. Great service. Very busy for breakfast, expect to line up several minutes but nothing crazy.",Good,,Good
"We were a bit hungry and decided to try this cafe as we were staying at Caesar's for the weekend. We shared a BLT, oh my, what enjoyment. Enough food to fill us both. Fresh bread plenty of bacon lettuce and tomato fixed to hmmm good",Good,Good,
"Caf√© Americano has a hodge podge of offerings for every cuisine (with spaghetti and Cape Cod fish featured next to each other).  Breakfast and burgers are OK, but expensive, running around $40 a person for a burger or breakfast entr√©e plus a drink, tax and tip.",Good,,
I will not dine here unless it is Happy Hour.  That is a bargain for Caesars.  We had happy hour drinks at the bar on this visit.  I added photos.  Very friendly bartender.,,,Good
"Service was great. Food was excellent but the prices are ridiculous!  We went for breakfast. My husband had bacon and eggs, orange juice and coffee. I had a veggie omelette, side of ham and coffee. The bill was $87 before the tip!!!!!",,,Good
Breakfast with mimosas was amazing. Loved the fact that it was open 24 hours. Service was great. The caipirinhas were delicious.,Good,Good,Good
"We had breakfast there twice during our visit and enjoyed it both times.  Food was good, plentiful, and the service and atmosphere were great.",Good,Good,Good
"Was looking for a lite dinner after a show, thought Cafe Americano would fit the bill, but no not really. Thought we could get a simple sandwich or salad, but no these for the most part were full blown meals. We finally settled for a couple of breakfast side dishes, all were salty. Like all the other restaurant / cafe options choices were high $$$$.",Bad,,
We were given HUGE plates of food.  We were not able to eat all of it.  The food was ok.  Burgers are gigantic and the drinks are expensive as is everything in Vegas.  Open late at night.  That is the good part.,Good,Good,
"Great place to grab a couple of beers (at anytime of day or night) but would definitely recommend trying some of their burgers and sandwiches whilst there. Found the staff very friendly and attentive, even during busy times. Visited a couple of times whilst in Las Vegas. The Cuban (pictured) was delightful!!",Good,Good,Good
"24 hours open, but food is not that good and really expensive. almost 30 usd for three eggs with toast",Bad,Good,
We ate there twice during our stay at Caesars Palace and food is delicious and generous servings. This place is open 24/7. They also have a bar area. Attire is casual. Wait staff are good and friendly.,Good,Good,Good
"I ate here several times and was only slightly disappointed once.


Service: For the most part, it was pretty good. There were times when it seemed like it took forever for someone to wait on us or get our food, but people watching and listening to the music occupied your time.


Food: We ate here for breakfast and late night. The only disappointment was the pepperoni pizza. Granted, I'm from Chicago, so I'm fussy about my pizza, but this would have been better if it had been cooked for a bit longer. The BLT? To die for! Literally the best BLT I've ever had! All American Breakfast and Denver Omelet were good. Roasted Free Range Chicken was very moist juicy and tasty.


Drinks: Totally recommend their Margarita and Cucumber Martini. Totally fell in love with both.


The prices are a bit on the steep end, but that kind of goes with the territory in Vegas. Look forward to eating here again.",Good,,Good
"I wanted to try Caf√© Americano for breakfast, to see if it could be in my routine while in Las Vegas.  The only time I have Eggs Benedict is when on vacation and it becomes a little something special.  Unfortunately, the Eggs Benedict there was extremely disappointing.  The worst thing about it was the English Muffins were stale and cold. They weren't as good as what you can pull off the shelf at your home grocery store. The Hollandaise was a cheap bland edition.  The potatoes were very good.  


I was there at the normal but slow breakfast time but there was such a lack of service.  It wasn't bad, just a lack of anybody checking on me.  If it wasn't for offering a to-go cup of coffee, I wouldn't have had nearly enough. The coffee was good. 


It's not going to be one of my places.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Very quick service. The food was okay. I ordered the pizza and it was okay, could have shared it and would still have been full. Others ordered the tacos and they were good but small. The quesadilla were very greasy. Chinese chicken salad was overpower by bacon bits. I ordered a coke but never received it. If you need a quick bite this would be a great place.",Good,,Good
This. This food was without a doubt delicious! the flat iron steak and egg breakfast is like eating an evening meal. The BBQ wings with the guava BBQ sauce went very well with the perfect margaritas. We did not have one bad meal here. The staff are courteous and efficient.,Good,,Good
Went for breakfast as we were staying close by. The food and service was great! Was very impressed with the portion size and the service was top notch!,Good,,Good
We never returned after being gouged for the first breakfast. The eggs were suppose to be runny and they were cooked. The eggs Benedict bread was so hard you could not cut through with a knife.,Bad,,
"Ate here for a late lunch one afternoon while staying at Caesars Palace. It was easy to get into, service was good and the food was good as well. I had the fish tacos which were excellent and my husband had pizza which was good but not to die for. They have a nice outdoor patio if you can get a table.",Good,Good,Good
"At any time of the day one can have an excellent meal, Goods and decent prices. We have eaten here more than 4 times in our stay",Good,Good,Good
"I went to breakfast here by myself as I travel with friends who don't appreciate fine dining.  I ate the corned beef hash breakfast with sunny side up eggs.  Next time I would say, very easy SS as they were still just a bit overdone for me.  The breakfast was expensive but that being said, I could barely make a dent in it.  It could have easily fed two people.  I liked the dining room and the ambience.  I'd for sure try it again!",Good,Good,
"This is a good restaurant for the times when you want to stop for something good but don't want to go to a fine dining place. The sandwiches, the soups, the 24 hr. breakfast are all really good. We have eaten there many times. I enjoy the guacamole, the tortilla soup, the blt (not your usual blt), the burgers -- ok, I've never ordered anything there that I didn't like.  The prices are moderate. Of course, we always expect to pay a bit more in Vegas.",Good,Good,
After a fun night out. We went and had breakfast here. Everyone was very friendly. There was no wait at all which was very nice. And food was great. I would recomend to eat here to anyone. I believe there open all day and all night.,Good,Good,Good
"When staying at Caesars Palace this it our go to spot for breakfast.


Service is fantastic and the breakfast are the wonderful and reasonably priced.


My go to breakfast was the Heuvo Rancheros (best I've had) and the Vegan Green smoothie. Never a disappointment and easy to find right off the main lobby.",Good,Good,Good
"Food was ok but overpriced. Food was not hot when delivered, tried the Cafe twice due to time constraints, and both times was not happy with the food or service.",Bad,,Bad
I was pleasantly surprised at how good the breakfast was at this place.  I got the corned beef hash and my wife got the huevos rancheros.  Both were excellent and the service was good too.,Good,,Good
Please get the large meatball!! I shared it with two of my sisters and still had some  left! well worth the $20 price tag! The bartender was amazing!,Good,,Good
"Average service, average atmosphere, average food. Don't misunderstand me on the night it serves its purpose. I just don't want to return. Ever.",,Bad,
The food is cooked to your request. Lots of food with each order. Waiters make sure your needs are met and continue to check during your dining experience.,Good,Good,Good
"Went there early on a Sunday. The restaurant was less than half full, but they made people wait about 15 minutes to be seated. Some people waited and others just left. The food was delicious once we got seated, but the price point is high.",Good,,Bad
Just ehh.  Not great not terrible. Not a bad place for quick service and just ok food. Service was mediocre. Probably would not go back.,,Bad,
"Last minute decision, and it was perfect. nice place to just sit, people watch, have a beverage and a delicious meal.",Good,Good,
"Great restaurant for breakfast.....but it will cost you 0ver 70 bucks for a breakfast for two.....nothing fancy.   Just eggs, hash browns , bacon toast and coffee.......no juice.",Bad,Good,
"Do not eat at this restaurant, we got aggressive food poisoning from their chicken wings. The most that the restaurant could ""do to help"" was suggest that we go to find a doctor in Las Vegas who would make an assessment, and after that we could make a medical claim against their insurance. I pointed out that people with aggressive food poisoning are not in a position to roam around Vegas searching for a doctor, especially when travelling home that same day...and that was all the restaurant could ""do to help"". Stay away!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Staying at Caesar's Palace for the first time we opted not to eat at the in house buffet but try Cafe Americano and we weren't disappointed. Emma C. Warmly greeted us. With the AC up in the hotel we opted for a seat bathed in sunshine and she was generous to accommodate us. Once seated We were well attended by three servers. 
Dorian V. started us with coffee and water. Raul G. Took our order. We both had the all American breakfast. Generous portions served promptly by Mark V. hot and delicious. Raul G.  Kept checking back to see if we needs anything else. All in all a delightful culinary experience right in the heart of the Palace.",Good,Good,Good
"This is the second time I visited this restaurant, the first time we went for brunch and I had Mimosas and waffles! YUM!",Good,,
"My server, Danielle A, was the best that I encountered on my trip to Vegas.  From customizing my salad to checking often to see what else i needed, she guaranteed that I was well taken care of.  Plus, she has a delightful and friendly personality that made me feel very welcome.",,Good,Good
We were seated immediately upon entering. Staff was very welcoming and friendly. I ordered the chicken salad. Chicken was dry and over cooked and overpriced. I'd skip this restaurant and try one of the many other places around.,Bad,Bad,Good
"The service was excellent the food was good, 40 dollars for 2 pancakes and a bacon and egg breakfast. I though was a little high.",Good,,Good
"Central, in the main lobby of Caesars Palace, was replaced by Cafe Americano and that's too bad.  Had dinner for three there.  Ordered chicken with potatoes, received chicken with a garish hash made of cauliflower dyed various colors, dry as a bone as was the chicken.  Service was indifferent.  My friend got a couple of pizzas and they were also lack luster.  With so many other choices, I would not recommend this restaurant.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Located near lobby at Caesars, this place has undergone several ownership changes and with each one the prices go higher.
They serve average food, breakfast, small pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, bar food. 
Average bill for breakfast about $30, entree and coffee. 


It's convenient but very, very expensive for 
Average faire",Bad,Good,
"This place have an amazing breakfast selection, managment is amazing and servers were so educated and helpful all the time.",Good,,Good
We ate breakfast here twice. The food was absolutely great. They have a Mexican bull with a rooster head on it instead of a bulls head and several of us rode it so the rest of the group could get a laugh. The service was great and the atmosphere was equally as great.,Good,Good,Good
"Im currently staying at Caesars Palace and while the hotel is holding up its end of the bargain with a great room in the Augustus Tower, this 24 hour restaurant has a limited comfort menu infused with Mexican Food. The food ranges from good to mediocre and fails to ""Hit the Spot"". For example, $22.00 for 3 eggs, bacon and toast is excessive as is the Carnitas Quesadilla for $24.00. The service was generally uninspired but passable. Compared to other offerings on the strip, this place suffers greatly. All style
no substance and a really crappy cup of coffee to boot !!! Avoid this place, waste your money on the slots...",Bad,Bad,
"In town for convention and staying at Caesar's.  Cafe Americano is open 24 hours and  is a convenient meeting place when staying at Caesar's Palace.


We dined there for breakfast daily and once for dinner.  The food is excellent but slightly overpriced.  Breakfast for two averaged $55 to $60.


The servers are amazing - Polite and Attentive!!  They are spread a little thin.


The hostess station is disorganized.  We made reservations on Open Table but were seated 10-15 minutes later than our reservation each time.


All things considered, I would still recommend Cafe Americano.",,Good,Good
A friend and I were in town for a conference and needed some lunch. We wanted to sit outside because we were craving the sunshine.  We stopped here because they had outside seating.  The staff were all extremely friendly but he menu gave us some sticker shock.  I ordered a mimosa which came out in a small plastic cup...very small.  $13!!!!  I ordered a salad from the menu as this seemed to be one of the cheaper items but for $14 I thought I'd be getting a heaping dinner plate of salad. Instead came out a salad plate full of types of lettuce I had never seen before.  It was good but definitely not filling nor worth the price.  Great atmosphere and great people but bring your wallet!,Bad,Good,
"Good place to grab a midrange bite when you are at Caesars, but definitely not cheap.  Service is good, a plain cup of coffee is expensive.  It is what it is.",Good,,Good

This place is excessively over priced. Every hotel/casino has their 24 hour caf√©, where you can go and get a quick breakfast or lunch. They are usually reasonable. NOT this place. 22 dollars for a typical eggs, toast, potatoes and sausage. Steak and eggs will set you back 45 dollars. Subpar service goes with the extravagant prices. Never again.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"First trip, was solo. Sat at bar had the Cuban sandwich and a Moscow mule. Sandwich was good size and tasty. Second visit was party of 3 had the nachos to share. Large portion and ""warm"" jalape√±os. Had the whole hog Pizza. 10"" and loaded with different kinds of pork. Would recommend over noodle 9 at Caesars Palace",Good,Good,
"My experience...well, let me just say that the staff members memory seems to be very short. You ask politely for two simple things and they deliver one barely. Where is the engagement, where is the passion, where is the service minded people?",,Bad,Bad
"We had just flown in when we decided to try this restaurant, it ended up being pricier than we would have thought for a ""caf√©"". But the food was so good it was worth the price and it came so quickly, which we appreciated after flying.",Good,,Good
Cafe Americano is a great restaurant to grab a bite in no matter what time of the day. Even at 3:00am we had great service and Good. They are very accommodating and had no problem making the mac and cheese for me without the bacon and chicken that normally comes in it. Would def go back.,Good,Good,Good
"The menu is dominated by alcoholic beverages, but they did have several traditional breakfast items on the menu.   All-American breakfast, with 3 eggs, choice of breakfast meats, potatoes and toast was prepared to specification and generous portion.  Service was friendly but nothing notable.",Good,,Good
"Standard breakfast that met expectations. Great service by a professional wait staff. Only draw back was the overall price. Just standard for Las Vegas Strip. ""HIGH""",Good,,Good
"We stopped here for a ""light"" dinner before heading off to see Elton John's concert.  The food was very good.  It arrived quickly and was plenty for four of us to share.",Good,,Good
"After seeing a show and gambling/drinking for a few hours we had the munchies.  Cafe Americano luckily is open 24 hours! 


Yes, it's expensive but it's Vegas!  Everything is over priced.  


We ordered the BLT (which had fried green tomatoes and a combo of really thick bacon and regular size extra crispy bacon!!) and the Patty Melt.  Both sandwhiches came with fries.  They were both a great choice and really hit the spot!


Our server was very nice and friendly, as was the hostess.",Good,Good,Good
"Food was ok,  prices were outrageous!  Just your average bacon and eggs breakfast for 24 dollars... I'll skip it next time.",Bad,Bad,
"this is the main conveniently placed general dining option right in the main lobby of the Cesar's hotel/casino on the strip in Las Vegas.


My main complaint here is the PRICING not the food. While I feel most seasoned travelers will find the food and service reasonable their ASTRONOMICAL PRICES are insulting to people who work for their money.......
figure areound $25-$30 average for a basic egg breakfast with a coffee or juice beverage before tax or tip ($8 for a side of toast as another example!)
Even if you enjoy the breakfast the "" without shame money-grab pricing"" is likely to leave you with a sour stomach. 


Unfortunately I found this to be a trend with most of the casual food and coffee type places on the Caesars property, look for a further review on Caesars.


Keep in mind my benchmark for pricing is typically Manhattan or any other large prominent metropolitan area where one can likely assume the rents and cost of living are higher than in Las Vegas Nevada.",Bad,Good,Good
"Came by before the Absinthe show, about 9:30 pm, ordered fish tacos and wife ordered shrimp tacos. Hers came out as a shrimp appetizer (not what we ordered). Server corrected the mistake. Food was bland, fish tacos had two fish bites (and I do mean bite-size) and a ton of cabbage and cilantro on them.  The  shrimp tacos weren't as bad, but I won't visit this restaurant again. Too many better eateries in Vegas.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"One of the lower priced options to dine at while at Ceasar's. All American type menu, good solid food, nothing spectacular. Great service.",Good,,Good
Our favorite meal while in Vegas in January was the nachos at Caf√© Americano.  The portion was HUGE and so 4 of us shared one order and we were all full afterwards!,Good,,
There were not many options for food that would be compatible with my seafood allergies.  The Asian salad was a good choice.,Good,,
"Average food, very Good, overpriced drinks BUT very close to Caesars Palace and that is a HUGE plus.


Convenience means a lot with all the Vegas traffic and if you going to a venue at Caesars, give Cafe America a try!",,Good,Good
"Came with a group of friends.


Restaurant was packed on a Sunday morning, but seated inside ten mins.


There is a charge of 18% for a party above 8 people.


Had the American breakfast. As I don't eat non halal meat, the waiter said not an issue and we can change for fruit if you wish.


Coffee and iced water served and topped up often.


Various people consumed their choices which went down well.


Excellent service and didn't wait long either despite the rush.",Good,,Good
"I am staying at Caesars for a convention. I had 9 associates for a week staying here.  It's tough to feed 9 people breakfast every morning.  We ate at Cafe Americano every morning.  All but one day we were very fortunate to have Keith as our waiter.  Keith was Awesome!  Keith managed our group each morning and never made a mistake.  I work in the service industry and understand how hard it is.  Keith made us feel welcome every time.  After the show ended, my wife and I stayed for a mini vacation.  Once again we asked for and were seated with Keith.  Keith remember our drink orders and really took care of us.  This morning I spoke to the manager Paloma, she was a pleasure to talk to.  Thanks again for having such a clean and great restaurant.  I will say once again Keith is a Awesome!!!


Jimmy",,Good,Good
"This restaurant is located inside Caesar's Palace, but has outdoor seating and a hookah bar right alongside it. The service was great, the server took very good care of us, and made sure we were happy with our meals (a vegan and vegetarian, we can get pretty fussy). Restaurant has a great view of one of the main vestibules in the casino, makes you want to get up and go exploring!",Good,Good,Good
Had a very tasty breakfast here that came with a very attentive service. The Eggs Benedict with fresh asparagus was great. Not cheap!,Good,,Good
"Yes it's a little expensive but it's on par with Vegas.  You can't beat the location for people watching no matter what time of the day.  The staff was friendly and Robbie the bartender certainly entertained us. The food is good, drinks are good and the staff knows how to make em tasty! I always come here when I visit Vegas, easy to get a seat or just stand at the bar and meet some people.",Good,Good,Good
"We stayed at Caesars for 5  days, and had breakfast here the first morning. Salt shaker was broken with rough glass at bottom that cut my finger. Order of toast? 8.00 cup of coffee? 5.50 only jelly available for a 22.00 scrambled egg plate? Grape. Jeez. Even a diner has fruit or marmalade. Waitress was doing us a favor by serving us. Home fries were half sweet potatoes - not mentioned on menu. Ate at Starbucks rest of week for breakfast.",Bad,Bad,
The hotel itself is very well appointed and this restaurant is the same.  The food was very good and reasonably priced.  The table next to us shared one piece of carrot cake that looked like it could have served four people!  They said it was worth it but we took their word for it since we didn't have enough room for dessert.,Good,Good,
Pretty Good at this location and situated close to the Absinthe show which is the reason why we ate here. Great service although prices are a little steep e.g $16 for a glass of house Cabernet and around $45 for steak and eggs (although the steak was really good),Good,Good,Good
Friendly staff but meals were over priced for the food quality. The green juice was interesting and surprisingly nice! It's convenient with quick service if you are staying at Caesars.,Bad,Good,Good
"This was the most healthy meal I had in Vegas.  I know ... not saying much and am not complaining about the great meals I had.  However, I am vegetarian and I don't eat grains ... I do eat eggs.  I had the best breakfast hash bowl I think they called it ... roasted vegetables (white and sweet potatoes, onions, asparagus) with two whole eggs on top.  So delicious.   Portions are large.  There were four of us and everyone was really happy with what they ordered and the service is great.",Good,Good,Good
"Had a late team dinner at the Cafe and the food was excellent.  Several of us shared the ""gi-normus"" nachos, then shared the BLT and Caesar's (of course) salad.  Great beer and wine selections.",Good,,
"Have dined there a number of times and it is hit and miss but mostly miss, unfortunately. The last time we went the service was extremely bad and the prices where outrageous for what we got. The waiter was down right rude and did everything in his power to ignore us. Believe it or not he was not even busy as there was only one other table occupied. You can tell that it is not part of Caesars even though it is in their hotel. Will not return!!!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
Relatively good value and the portion of the breakfast is large.  Service is fast and attentive.  Good for quick bite.,Good,,Good
"We ended up eating here due to extremely long wait lines at the buffet and Beijing Noodle No. 9.  We had to eat early to make the Elton John concert.  Husband got the fish and chips and said it was good.  I got the roasted chicken.  It was so-so.  Covered in some brown gloopy sauce, it was overdone and dry.  It had a weird aftertaste, also.  The 'trio' of roasted potatoes was also overdone and dry.  Wish they'd just offer fries.  
Service was good, but a bit harried due to the New Year's Eve crowd.",Bad,,Good
"Staying in Caesar's for 10 days we have used this facility a fair amount for both take away and eat in food.  As the go to place for residents to get a snack or beverage, you would think for 4000 rooms there would be a suitable number of staff available to suit the times.


Going for some breakfast, you are left waiting for a table for 2 for about 10 minutes when you can clearly see there are plenty of seats.  Food is nice if on the expensive side.  Coffee is around $7.00 and 2 slices of toast $8.00 and burger from $20.00


If you are looking for coffee either late or early i.e. post 1am and before 6.30am, they often only have 1 member of staff and still a fair number of guests at these times.  When there has been more than 1 person on duty, they are often busy as it is next to the casino so pretty busy 24/7


As nothing is provided for guests in the rooms, you would expect a more reasonably priced facility to provide coffee and snacks to residents.


On a plus note, the food is nice and coffee is good!",Good,,Bad
When we are near Caesar's we like to dine or have a beverage at the Cafe. The bar tenders are super and the food is great. If you are going to shows at Caesars and want to dine prior you won't be disapointed.,Good,Good,Good
"December Sun is the Best. We went to Ceasars to get drinks and tan. We ended up spending 2 hours with cofee, drinks, football and lunch. And a lot of sun. Great service and very calm surroundings.",Good,Good,Good
"Woke up late and wanted breakfast.  Headed downstairs for a bite. They advertise that breakfast is served all day, but in reality,  it's only a couple of breakfast choices. We ordered 3 American breakfasts for $22 and some scrambled eggs with hash browns.  4 coffees and bloody mary. Our food and drinks took forever! Our server was good, but it just took way too long to get our food. The place wasn't evencrowded. For 4 people our bill was $230. Dang, this was just a simple breakfast,  nothing extraordinary.  Don't get me wrong, the night before, we had an awesome dinner at N9ne the steak house and spent $360 people couple,  so it's not a money thing. The Americano is very overpriced and TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The atmosphere was great the cocktails are amazing .The staff friendly and attentive. Must visit ,food are large portions . Interacted with manager who was friendly and informative .This venue is the place to be in Las Vegas.",Good,Good,Good
Food and service was great but prices were too high for us! Coffee was $5.50 a cup!  Breakfast ran us about $65 including tip.,Bad,,Good
"we liked the places - we stayed in Ceasers and therefore it was the ideal choice! had drinks outdoor, breakfast & one dinner - all was fine! good menue, reasonable prices & and friendly and attentive personell! good place to relax a little in this crazy city!",Good,Good,Good
"Wonderful service and food in large quantity. Keith is the man!!!!   Tasty, well presented food.  Tables along the exterior of the room provide a little privacy as well.  Love it here.",Good,Good,Good
My son and I ate at this place and they had some Good and drinks. The service was great as well and very polite and helpful workers. Try it out folk's.,Good,Good,Good
"A bit pricey?  Sure, it's Caesars.
Good atmosphere?  Sure, it's Caesars.  Food quality and taste...not excellent but certainly good.  
Service?  EXCELLENT!  If the food was as good as the service it would be a 5 Star.  Raul was our server and was not only professional, he was prompt, very friendly, and after only one breakfast/lunch day, he greeted us as if he knew us.  He remembered exactly what we had ordered the prior day.  I find that pretty amazing in light of the fact that they serve so many people each day.


The breakfast menu is ample and tasty. My wife's lunch salad was, well, a salad. My side order of fruit was fresh and was a generous portion. We absolutely will make our daily visit to caf√© Americano on our next stay at Caesars.",Good,Good,Good
"I had their turkey and ham sandwich with pesto which was great. Though, it had so much meat on it I couldn't get it in my mouth! I loved it so much that I had it twice!",Good,,
"Although I feel that the level of smoke in Caesars Palace is among the worst in Vegas, this cafe within the hotel does a pretty good job of maintaining fresh air. Such a reprieve. The service and food were excellent, and if you're at Caesars Palace, it's obviously very convenient. Highly recommended.",Good,Good,Good
Portions were generous at breakfast which was prepared pretty well. Service attentive. Adjacent to main lobby,Good,,Good
"Ok, so this place is in Caesar's Palace so you'll already know that the prices are going to over-inflated.


However, the service is top notch, the coffee was good, and the food was very tasty.


I had the Buffalo wings and they were just right, tangy and juicy.


Nice atmosphere to sit and people watch.",Good,Good,Good
"I popped in here for breakfast when I was staying at the Cromwell across the road.


I ordered a sandwich which was supposed to contain scrambled egg. In fact it was actually more like an omelette which in a sandwich is totally the wrong texture. The side of breakfast potatoes was undercooked. It took ages to get the attention of a barman to get ketchup (i.e. they didn't ask if everything was OK, did I need anything). Bad and Bad, and worst of all it was not cheap. Avoid.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The food was yummy, but it was over priced for the items on the menu.  Yet besides the buffet it is the cheapest place to eat in Caesars.",Good,,
Nice place to stop for a beer on tap. It actually saved me quite a bit because while I was drinking I wasn't gambling. And I got free peanuts. They serve food also and they are open 24 hours but I did not partake.,Good,Good,
I had some extra comp dollars and decided to try this restaurant.  My aunt enjoyed her breakfast which looked fresh and even the potatoes were home made.  I ordered the pizza and it was okay.  The food was decent for a casino and I would visit here again.  They also have happy hour which I didn't get to try it.,Good,,
Good simple food. Great service. The braised short rib tacos were very good. I'd definitely go there again.,Good,Good,Good
Good. Waiters are friendly and respectful of expectations ... Was on a business trip. Good and great folks.,Good,Good,Good
"Perfect place to eat...here right now at bar...most welcoming staff...last night Ian(manager) was terrific and actually talked to us...2 of us on ""old girls"" trip...had clam chowder which is an absolute must & Caesar salad...delicious...Saul(waiter) was great...include hostesses here as you come in...this morning for breakfast...lox & bagels for me & All American for friend...Paloma also came by as Ian did to every table...Nick(waiter) so accomodating and Ruben who made sure we had water & coffee...food is just so good... menu is varied..still full at 5 in the afternoon !...Enjoy! We will eat here tonight & have breakfast tomorrow!",Good,Good,Good
"The location of the restuarant right beside the lobby of Caesar's is very convenient.  That may explain why the prices are so high.  We did, however, have excellent food here.",Good,Good,
"This restaurant has an amazing BLT with deep fried tomatoes on it!  Yummy!  It is big enough for two people so be prepared to split this meal!  They have IPA's and make amazing margaritas!   We also stopped for a snack later that afternoon, wings were good!  Spicy not BBQ!",Good,,
"This is a great bar to meet new people and to make as your starting point. I have to thank the manager there because I went there thinking it was the Lobby Bar, which is actually located over by the slot machines. He told me that Cafe Americano is a better bar but I was meeting people at the Lobby Bar. He told me that if I brought a group back with me, he would hook me up with a free drink. I was putting on a Photo Scavenger Hunt and our meet up location was at the Lobby Bar. Once everyone arrived, we marched back to Cafe Americano where the manager was good on his word and gave me a free drink. Not only that, but he gave us a good price when we ordered 11 shots to start off our night :) It's a very cool atmosphere and the food is quite good there as well. Since I was staying at Caesars, I went back several times for drinks and was never disappointed.",Good,Good,Good
"There is a great variety of food in Las Vegas, making it hard to choose and not always getting a great meal. ‚ÄúCaf√© Americano‚Äù is an impressive blend of Cultural food, Cuban, African, and Mexican cuisine coming together in a perfect marriage making it a must stop in Las Vegas inside Caesars Palace.  My husband and I started with Guacamole and chips. NOT your usual!  It was FRESH with the right size of avocado pieces, onions, tomatoes with a hint of cilantro. ‚ÄúAwesome!‚Äù   I wanted to lick the metal bowl it came in instead I used my knife to get it all out. 
I had a Fish Tacos (mahi-mahi not Taipa or haddock) it did not come out looking the usual color, fried with coleslaw on top. NO, NO, it came out with shreds of deep purple and red cabbage topped with a crumb light fried small section of an avocado. ‚ÄúWow‚Äù, and the taco was contained not in one soft tacos but two.  When I have ordered fish taco in the past it falls apart, this one did not.  Topping the dish off were two sauces to die for. This meal defiantly contained spices from the trio Cultures.  
My husband had the beef shredded Nacho‚Äôs. My husband only came up for air to sip the free martini that came along with the dinner. It was too much food for my husband to eat at one sitting so it was boxed up and he eat it for breakfast the next day.
Saul our waiter, very professional, even though time had passed for the Early bird special he presented it to us after we had inquired about it. Saul provided real conversation in seeing to our comfort. The Manager Carlos stopped by the table to ask how we enjoyed the meal.",Good,Good,Good
"Nothing really to brag about here. 


Menu did not have a lot of variety. 


Clam chowder - good 
Pizza (ham pineapple) - good
Tacos - really good 


It is a fine place to stop into but if you are planning out your Vegas trip I would find something better.",Good,Good,
We ate breakfast and lunch here and were never disappointed.. the food was excellent and the portions huge. Our server everytime just happened to be Keith and he was by far the most exceptional server at Caesar' s Palce by far. His customer service skills are off the chart and his attention to details is amazing. He is a great ambassador for the Americano.,Good,Good,Good
"We had to find someplace to eat breakfast at 5 a.m. before leaving for the airport while in Las Vegas.  Since we were staying at Caesars, Caf√© Americano was our best choice.  Now our other 2 breakfasts were at Mon Ami Gabi in Paris and the French blew the American's away by comparison.  First, my husband and I cannot eat gluten.  The gluten free bread at Caf√© Americano was so-so, but at least they HAD gluten free bread. I had eggs benedict but it was overloaded with some fried potato concoction of white and sweet potatoes and peppers that was largely unappealing to me and took up too much of my plate.  In asking for some fresh blueberries for my gluten free cereal, it took them about 20 minutes to deliver them.  I wasn't like the place was hopping with people at 5 a.m., even in Las Vegas.  And then there was the bill - over $100 for 2 breakfasts!  Our bill at Mon Ami Gabi where we had more variety and better tasting food was $70 or less over the prior two days.  Well, at least it was better than trying to eat at the airport with our food allergies.  It's OK in a pinch, but I wouldn't seek out the place as a must go to restaurant.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had breakfast one day and dinner the next. The food was delicious for both meals and reasonably priced. Our server was Maggie and she was a treasure. She was friendly and efficient. She made sure our food was perfect. We asked her for some suggestions for a day tri to sight see around Las Vegas. She suggested several places, one of which was Red Rock Canyon. This lead to a wonderful day on a beautiful scenic drive. Thank you Maggie. We hope to see you again on our next trip to Las Vegas.",Good,Good,Good
"We enjoyed breakfast here one morning.  The entrees are enormous!  The service is impeccable!  The fruit was fresh, the omelets were excellent; definitely more food than a person could eat in one sitting!",Good,,Good
"My opinion of this place changed dramatically on this recent trip.  The food is OK, but certainly not worth the ticket prices.  Hamburger (which comes with a tiny salad) and a draft beer?  $44.  Waffle and a cup of coffee?  $27.  I had comps to pay for these outrageous prices, but I got a hard time over cashing the comps.  They told me ""The system is down, so we cannot accept your Caesar's 'points.'""  So I am sent to the Total Rewards desk, and eventually to the restaurant manager - who says ""The restaurant is leased to an outside company, and only accepts Caesar's comps as a courtesy.  If the 'system' is down, we cannot do anything.""  I paid cash, then raised sand with every person who had a Caesar's badge on.  They eventually gave me my money back, but what a monumental, useless hassle.


On no planet in this galaxy is the food at this place worth the prices they charge.  The service is OK most of the time.  Sometimes the employees are too interested in bird-dogging some good looker, or discussing some event they attended, but their attitude is generally good.  They have a tough job, so one can make allowances.  


In summary, Caesar's is still nice, but not THAT nice.  Kind of summarizes Vegas overall.",Bad,,Good
"Food is Ok, Service is good and yes the only great thing is that its 24 hrs so u can get food anytime.",Good,Good,Good
"We got a few cocktails upon checking in a Ceasars.. Bombay Shapire, makers, and a 1/2 glass of wine for $55....the people watching was solid though...in Ceasar's lobby.  We had breakfast the following morning....the portions are huge...sharing would be recommend ed..great coffee.  Corned beef hash was amazing...solid service too!",Good,Good,Good
"The restaurant serves average food in a terrible atmosphere with a staff that is not only unfriendly, but also openly fights with each other. Avoid this restaurant at all costs.",,Bad,Bad
"We went to this restaurant usually for breakfast. The portions are huge. The omelets are enough for two people I asked for orange marmalade as I did not see any on the table. They brought it out in separate container with an additional charge, but it was very good. It was very busy and good but a little on the expensive side.",Good,,
"I ate at the Cafe Americano four times while staying at Caesars Palace. The food was decent, nothing spectacular, and a bit expensive. My favorite dessert was the homemade blueberry peach pie. So good! Also i recommend the hash browns.


Late night the bar was busy with witty bartenders and a nice array of cocktail options. We also saw several prostitutes pick up clients at the bar which was...interesting.",Good,Good,
"We ate here for breakfast one morning, lunch twice.  The food is great, the service is superb but the prices are ridiculous.  I'm sorry but when I spend $20US for three pancakes and it's put on my Visa in Canadian, that's $26.00.  It was muffins and coffee from some small shop elsewhere all the other mornings.  Breakfast for myself and my wife was $75Canadian.  I know we should have expected that with the terrible exchange rate but I'd rather spend my money on something else than pancakes.  As for the restaurant itself, it was terrific.  
  One side is the sports bar side so it can get a little noisy when a game is on and there seemed to be sports games on every time we were there.  The other half is away from the bar scene and quieter and they do have an outdoor patio if you want to be out in the Vegas heat.  I'd recommend this restaurant if you don't care what it costs for food and you don't have to think of Canadian dollars.  It is an A+ restaurant.",Bad,Good,Good
"My daughter and I had a late night supper after arriving in Las Vegas we walked along the strip and decided to have a bite to eat at Cafe Americano . We ordered chicken tenders and fries to share between us and we were glad we had just one order it was a very generous proportion . The service was very good, friendly courteous staff.",Good,,Good
"Hey I love the pizza, breakfast, celebrities Billie Jean King & other tennis players were there when we were! Oh they have the best Corned Beef sandwich, Everything just go!",Good,Good,
It's a very convenience location a beautiful place right  at gorgeous Caesars palace lobby breakfast a little price but amazing huge portions and service was good in a very busy breakfast I  can understand but definitely we are coming back,Good,Good,Good
Had breakfast day we left here. Quick seating and service. Had the american breakfast with OJ. Very good and filling. Nice restaurant.,Good,Good,Good
"I agree with the other recent reviews - small portions, overpriced, and not great quality. I rate Vegas restaurants more harshly because I hold them to a higher standard. I went here for a quick breakfast, and the prices seemed high, but I thought maybe the portions were large. They were medium-sized portions, just average eggs Benedict. Side of bacon was $9 for two or three strips deep-fried to the edge of dust. Toast was burned... definitely won't be back. There are much better breakfasts on the strip for less money.",Bad,Bad,
"We were walking by Caesar's, and spotted this cafe . We chose it because it had outside seating with little couches, and we had babies in a stroller so we thought it was a good spot to grab a drink , and a bite while enjoying the Vegas warm weather. We stood outside the hostess station for about 15 minutes-nothing.. Went inside the casino through the inside entrance, and that hostess told us to go back out to the patio, and to sit anywhere we would like because  it was open seating.. ok??Couldn't you a put signed back there that stated that?!? 
 We ordered strawberry Mojitos , and 15 minutes later  they brought us two beers. Ask again for strawberry Mojito's and another 15 minutes later they came  in small rinky-dink plastic cups. Tasted not an ounce of  alcohol too.. Really $15 bucks for that?? We ordered the giant meatball, and the ceviche for our bites.. The giant meatball was meh at best.. I thought it was kind of bland and tasteless. The ceviche was inedible.  It was floating shrimp with some fish chunks  floating in an avocado drippy wet salsa.  I took a bite of the shrimp it tasted funny I was scared to eat the rest. My girlfriend also took a bite, and said the same thing . ""Tasted off"" . This place is horrible!  There was nobody there the service was so slow. The drinks were a disgrace, and the food was disgusting.. For $70 I enjoyed only the water.",Bad,Bad,Bad
the good is good but so very overpriced for average.  I had a friut plate for $19 and Breakfast should never cost $64 anywhere,Bad,,
"Decentish food but way too expensive, it's just a cafe after all, no wonder it was only a quarter full at anytime !!",Bad,,
We wanted a quick lunch and ordered the nachos and chicken fingers to share The portions were Vegas size but the quality average . With one beer the price came to 58$Would not return as I felt we found better quality  lunch menus at other locations for a lessor price. Menu items for breakfast wer expensive ie. eggs benedict 28$. not for the budget consciouss eater.,Bad,,
"We visited October 2, 2016 . We had put our name in at serendipity, which servers breakfast all day long, but never got a table. So, we walked to the Cafe Americano not far and got a table right away, (that should have been the key right away, it was 8:30 a.m.). A common breakfast of bacon, two eggs, hash browns, toast was $23.00. Three pancakes $20.00... A glass of juice $8.00. One pancake $6.00. Coffee $6.00. Then, when the service is bad on top of high prices.... They brought the meal, but you had to ask for salt and pepper, Tabasco, syrup, and by the time someone came back your food was cold.... I asked for a bagel with butter they brought whipped cream cheese, I thought it was butter so I put it on my bagel and discovered it was not butter, but no one had come back to the table to check on us to see how the meal was (plus could not be flagged downed) .... then when they picked up our plates and I had not eaten any of my bagel they did not ask if there was a problem... We found the next day a great buffet for $19.50 at the ""Grand Lux Cafe"" at the Venetian and also at the Palazzo can't beat it, and the service was super...",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I had breakfast here each day, lunch on the day I arrived and quite a few drinks. It's an easy-going bar and restaurant just off the lobby in Caesars Palace, open 24 hours. Very happy with the quality of the food and the service.",Good,Good,Good
"As we stayed in Caesars palace, it was nice just to go down and have breakfast there ( 24 hours aday, breakfast served until 11.30am ). Great waffles with cream and fruit, nice bacon and eggs, good coffee and a friendly service also. We used this place for five days straight, no problems to report. They let us charge all food to the room, which gave us more money to spend on the strip. Happy Days.",Good,,Good
"Had breakfast at this restaurant.  It is open 24 hours a day at Caesars Palace.  My Eggs Benedict w/fruit costs $29.  It was very good, but a bit pricey, IMHO.",Good,Good,
"A great place to meet up in Caesars. Food is fresh, portions massive, good for sharing, great cocktails and mean gin and tonics.",Good,Good,
"My husband and I were staying at Caesar's Palace and decided to have breakfast here because it was so convenient.  Although the place was crowded, we were seated quickly.  The menu had a good selection, and the food was excellent.  I was also impressed that there were packs of stevia sugar substitute on the tables, because I usually have to provide my own.",Good,Good,
I love that this is open 24 hours a day all day everyday. Even in Vegas sometimes I find the shops and restaurants aren't open long enough for me. We were staying in the Augustus tower which is right next to this restaurant. It was the obvious choice for breakfast. I'm glad I had us head down at 8:30 AM on a Saturday because there was a huge line around 9 AM. We both ordered mimosas and the breakfast sandwich. The sandwich was very filling and so delicious with everything you could want in a breakfast sandwich. We'd definitely eat here again for any meal if we can get a table.,Good,Good,
"We had a drink, a late night snack and a breakfast during our stay and it was all good and the service was fine.",Good,,Good
"Indoor seating was an option, but the weather was nice, so we went outside. A bit of a wait, so I put my hand over the table and it came back with dirt on it.  We asked for the twofer that was advertised for 2 margaritas and 6 fish tacos. Margaritas in a plastic cup, that weren't up to par, tacos were poor, price$50/per person and really loud (even by Vegas standards) tv outside of Caesars.
Not up to Ceasars standards.",Bad,Good,
Food was not great - prices were too high for what you got. And the wait staff was slow and unfriendly.,Bad,,Bad
"The service was awesome , the food was perfect....and the prices are reasonable , to....Opened 12 hours !!!! The best in Caesars Palace, period....",Good,Good,Good
"We recently stayed at Caesar's Palace and ate at Cafe Americano three times. Each time, the food was delicious and the service was excellent. It's open 24 hours and it's a great place to catch a game or just people watch as it's located by the doors going into the lobby. The bartenders are friendly and love to mix up concoctions for you. Thank you to Luis, Rodney and Tayton for your excellent service and friendly demeanors! Would definitely recommend having a bite here!",Good,Good,Good
"Located in Caesars Palace, this is an all night cafe with really Good!  We've been back on several visits for the short rib nachos....more than a meal for two people!!  
Manager Paloma is kind and friendly and we enjoyed visiting with her.  Server extraordinaire Silvano is great if you need awesome service late at night or early morning! 
This cafe also provides food to go if you want something for your room. 
Consistently friendly and good, we'll go every time!!",Good,Good,Good
"The menus was extensive and the server helped my finicky friend find something that she could and would eat. Not an easy task, trust me.",Good,,Good
We are here a few times for breakfast during our stay at Caesars. The staff are very attentive and the food is excellent quality at a reasonable price for Vegas Strip restaurants. The only downside is the restaurant isn't owned by Caesars and so any breakfast allocation can't go towards it or your player reward points can't either!,Good,,Good
"Just a normal place for comfort food. The cafeteria of the Caesars.
Certainly are better laces around with much better prices.",Good,,
"Stopped in one night for some champagne and pizza and loved it. We actually sat outside and the waiter was lovely and so helpful ((he gave us some suggestions of what we could do tomorrow). We always then made a point of stopping in to even grab a coffee.
The service was excellent.",Good,,Good
"The meatball is a little bigger than a baseball, served with marinara and grated cheese in a bowl. On the side was grilled toast, butter and sliced red pepper. I also had lemonade. It was excellent.",Good,,
"So convenient , great options for breakfast, and the food taste great and their presentation was awesome. Lots of choices",Good,Good,
"Cafe Americano is situated inside the hotel lobby of Caesars Palace and is open 24hrs for food and drink. Although we didn't dine here we opted to use the outdoor bar most days on our way out and on our return for a couple of drinks. A special mention to Apryl T who served us on more than one ocassion, she was lovely, polite and seemed genuinely interested in chatting to us and remembered us saying we were off on a helicopter trip to celebrate our honeymoon, as she asked about it immediately the next time we saw her. Thank you for making us feel welcome Mark & Kirsty UK",,Good,Good
Ate breakfast here on our first morning in Vegas. Portions are large and tasty. We were even offered a cup-to-go for our coffee as we left!,Good,,
"Compared to other places to get a good burger, this was about $5 higher per meal...but the food was very good and the service good (not great) too.  People were helpful (we had someone with a dietary issue with us)...but we did have to ask again for items we had ordered, but had not come with our orders",Good,,Good
"We were attending a wedding ceremony later evening at Caesers. We stayed at a different property so we decided to have light snack and a glass of wine. 
The service was outstanding - the waiter had so much personality. 
The prices were steep but what you expect in Las Vegas.",,,Good
"We ate here several times during our stay and each time the food was really good and service was excellent.  Must try the rib meat nachos, more than one person can eat and delicious.",Good,Good,Good
"Like most places in Las Vegas, the prices were steep, but the food was really good and the service was also good. They serve their sodas in mason jars which I thought was a cute touch. The fries come in their own mini fryer basket which is also adorable. It was a relaxing lunch and we enjoyed the food quite a bit.",Good,Good,Good
This place is not a cheap place to stop fro breakfast but it's superb great service great setting in Caesars palace lobby .,Good,Good,Good
"We ate at this restaurant 3x while we were staying at Caesar's.  Also had dessert there later one night.  The sandwiches are HUGE, you can def. share with someone.  Breakfast was really good.  Late night pie, ahhhh, don't think I would order again.  Way too sweet and too much dough, but it was tasty enough I guess?  We really enjoyed this restaurant.",Good,Good,
A little pricey but more food than you need. My sister and I ended up sharing there was so much food.,Good,,
"Didn't actually eat here, my friends and I always seemed to land up here as our last ""one for the road"" before going back to our hotel, which was usually in the early hours of the morning.  Fab friendly staff who we had such a laugh with.  We were calling it our ""local"" by time we came home. Drinks were lovely - love the Berry Vodka",Good,Good,Good
"Had breakfast for 2 at the Cafe Americano in Ceaser's Palace. I ordered 2 eggs over medium, bacon and tea. Hubby had the same plus hash browns. Got eggs over easy. And a bill for $50.


Service was excellent and I know Vegas is expensive. But I will not be returning.",Bad,Bad,Good
"Had a pleasant lunch.  We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table for 5 people which is fine but then by the time the waiter came back to us the breakfast menu was no longer available.


We ordered some drinks but then it seemed like we were forgotten again for quite a while before we were able to place a food order.


Food was pretty average.  I ordered a fried chicken sandwich with coleslaw.  There was very little coleslaw and the whole thing was a bit dry.  Couldn't get the waiter's attention to ask for some more.


I would go back if I couldn't something I prefer nearby.  It was fairly solid all around apart from the slow service",Bad,,Bad
Restaurant has a variety of breakfast selections.  Serving are large.  Staff is quite attentive to the customers.  Great way to start a day!!!,Good,,Good
"We were walking around waiting for room to be ready for check in and stopped at the Cafe Americano. We had dinner reservations later for a steakhouse so we shared some dishes so as not to get too full. The buttermilk chicken sandwich was really good, a little dry, but excellent flavor and crispy. The star-SHORT RIB NACHOS! Wow those were good, huge portion too, probably the 4 of us could have shared this alone. Really fresh ingredients and the short ribs were so tender. We would go back just for this starter!",Good,Good,
Overpriced and underserviced. The prices are not justified either by the selection or the staff's willingness to help out. They would rather pay you out.,Bad,Bad,Bad
Eggs hashbrowns toast bacon for myself and hamburger and fries for the husband. We give the restaurant a 10 out of 10. The staff is very nice and friendly. Big portions. Slightly higher costs but well worth it.,Good,Good,Good
"Absolutely pathetic service. Overpriced wine and small serving. Small overpriced sailed.  Went there after lunch and the place was near empty, but the waiter was so inattentive we sat for maybe 8 minutes without him coming over to us.  Couldn't get our drinks, managers standing around and not responding very well to another four top that was complaining they haven't been greeted yet.  Not for me....not ever again.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"On a recent trip to Caesars Palace my wife and I went looking for breakfast, we found the Cafe Americano. It was busy and we had to wait 15 minutes for a table which wasn't bad. The breakfast menu was typical, fried eggs, omlets, waffles etc. What wasn't typical were the prices. Now I know this isn't the Las vegas of old with $.99 breakfasts and $10 prime rib dinners but $60 for breakfast for two is just outrageous, it was nothing special just eggs and bacon, come on.",Bad,,
Eggs benedict for me hash for hubby. Both items best ever. Fresh but expensive.  $25 each with $6 coffee. Same price for most all items on menu. Also ate late dinner. Shared a sandwich and fries which kitchen split without us asking. Great food.,Good,,
"A great option before Absinthe.  We wanted some place close to the show.  We shared the guac and chips thinking it would be a small portion of quac.  My husband had a house salad and I had the Latino Vegan Quinoa.  The quac and chips would have been enough for dinner for both of us.  It was a lot and really good!  My husband's house salad was huge and he enjoyed it.  


My Latino Vegan Quinoa was huge as well.  The flavors blended so well.  


The service was also very good.  The waiters were very quick to make sure we had what we needed and made sure we were satisfied.  It was a very pleasant dining experience for our first night in Vegas.  We had more than enough time to go around the corner to our show.",Good,Good,Good
I ate here 6 times. The breakfast was good but expensive. The best thing was the roast chicken. It was great. The oatmeal was runny. Just okay. Overall a good honest meal.,Good,,
Stopped by on our between casinos to have a drink. These were the worst drinks we had the entire trip. Cosmos were $15 and size of a shot and pure juice. We ordered 6 drinks and it took 45 minutes for them to make them and we were the only group out there. The other drinks were also like drinking straight juice. Save your money and go somewhere like Rhumbar you will be better off.,Bad,Bad,Bad
Food here was excellent - as you would expect from Bobby Flay. It was quiet at lunchtime - a nice surprize - and the price was great $50 for 2 without drinks,Good,Good,
"Ambience was amazing open 24 hours with a bar and outdoor seating as well as bar and seating inside Caesar's Palace. Apryl was our server and was awesome! The pizzas, sandwiches, salads were all excellent!",Good,Good,Good
"This restaurant is 24 hours, and located just off the lobby within Caesars Palace. We had lunch here after a long morning and needed refreshment quickly. Our needs were met and exceeded with friendly and fast service, as well as very Good.",Good,Good,Good
"Have been here 3 times now: breakfast, dinner and afternoon snack/coffee. 


Each time we enjoyed our experience.  From just my wife and I right up to family of 8 attending we experienced the same level of service and assistance each time. 


In each instance we often needed to adjust menu items to suit different dietary requirements and to their credit, nothing was too difficult and always happy to oblige us.


Pricing at each sitting was very reasonable. The venue itself is very comfortable, attractive and immaculately clean, well positioned in the centre of Caesar's.",Good,Good,Good
"Considering this cafe is located within Caesar's Palace we expected much better service.   We were seated quickly, but waited almost 20 minutes before ever seeing a server.  Service really is an issue. Food quality was average.  Very expensive for portion sizes and the type of food.",Bad,,Bad
"Had breakfast here and the food and service were good.  Only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table.  Our waiter was very pleasant and attentive.  Our food was very good and the omelette that my wife received was enormous.  The ingredients tasted fresh and we both enjoyed our meals.  The place is pricey, but that is expected here at Caesars Palace.  A side of toast is $7, and a side of bacon is $9.  I would probably eat elsewhere that is a little bit more affordable next time.",Good,,Good
"Stay away if you have Celiac or Gluten Free (GF) sensitivity! The menu has items listed as gluten free. I informed the waiter of my GF sensitivity and he seemed to understand. I ordered the Grilled Mahi-Mahi (comes with red quinoa and corn avocado salsa) and I felt the pain (headache, fatigue, stomach pains) within a few hours and throughout the next day. My recovery time was 1 1/2 days, and I have never experienced such a lengthy recovery time. I can't imagine what it would be like for someone who has Celiac!! This restaurant made my birthday (the next day) rather miserable. It was so bad I questioned my husband as I thought perhaps I had too much to drink, of which he confirmed I really did not. 


For those who do not have issues with gluten, the Mahi-Mahi was bland...granted I ordered GF. It was as though the chef simply plopped the Mahi-Mahi on the grill with no seasoning or even lemon. Best tasting was the quinoa. My husband, who is not GF, ordered the Corned Beef sandwich. It is thinly sliced and he really liked the sandwich. He did not feel it was worth the price point. However, it's Vegas and dining out is pricey overall along the strip.",Bad,Bad,
"had breakfast during a stay at Caesars last week,
$17.00 for their least expensive breakfast which consisted 
of cold eggs, ham and potatoes... service slow
just nothing good to say about it.. $3.00 grand slam at Dennys is better
food but this is $17 each ( I tipped more than the breakfast was worth)
I assume since Caesars has you captured they try and screw you on the food prices.
worked only once, left for breakfast the other days of my stay and never had dinner there except once at Earl of Sandwich in their food court (its a great place however)
Not really any reasonable spots on the Strip anymore for food I may start staying at
Golden Nugget and Uber to strip at night... better deals...",Bad,Bad,
"When we stay at Caesars we end up eating here because it is the only place to eat after midnight. For a cafe/coffee shop they are a tad overpriced. They only serve breakfast until 11 am, if you are not an egg and pancake person, the fruit plate is excellent. If you are looking for a late night snack to share I recommend the short rib nachos. The nachos are great and there is  there is enough food for 3 people. My son had the patty melt and said wasn't very good and didn't even eat half of it. I had the burger and when I ordered I specified very well done, absolutely no pink. When the burger arrived it was pink, she offered to send it back but I do not send food back. She did not offer to take it off the bill or bring me something else. If you want more of a selection, you could walk next door to Bellagio, there coffee shop has a better lat night menu.",Bad,Bad,
"This is the only 24 hour eaterie in Caesars Palace. I ate here twice and the food was great. Big portions and very tasty food. The pancake stack with bananas was awesome, only problem was I could not finish it as it was too filling. Great place to eat but quite Pricey.",Good,Good,
"Went here a few times while staying at Caesar's. Service was good and reasonable choice of beer on tap. Didn't eat here but saw the portions of people that did and they looked quite a good size. 


Handy as a meeting place when you are going out in a big group, as you can always have a beer while waiting the for the stragglers.",,Good,Good
Don't let the large cost of the food scare you! The quantity of food will! The pizza was great! The drinks are very strong!,Good,,
"Food is good, servers are friendly but rushed.  Simple menu with fast service.  Prices are very high.  Stop in for a late night snack.",Good,,Good
My husband and I ate breakfast at Cafe Americano during our stay at Caesars.  The portions are huge and big enough for two people.  This place stays open 24 hours a day and seems popular based on the number of people I saw come and go.,Good,Good,
"We stopped into the bar at this establishment inside Caesar's Palace for a drink after some afternoon shopping on the strip to escape the scorching heat.  It is located in a bustling foyer between towers of the hotel and as the bar is right on it, the people watching is very good.  I was in the mood for a craft beer and our server Ryan's suggestion of the Magic Hat IPA really hit the spot.  My girlfriend had her regular Tito's and soda.  We sat there talking and looking and were never rushed.  Can't comment on the food as we didn't eat, but if you're on that part of the strip and want to wet your whistle, this is a good place to do it.",,Good,Good
"The 3 meat omelet was exploding with meat!  Very generous portion and delicious!!
Wonderful customer service!",Good,,Good
"We stopped by after watching the Mariah Carey show. I'm not a fan of wings, but these were big, juicy and delicious.
Great atmosphere.",Good,Good,
"Food was very good, but shocked at the prices. I enjoy breakfast and the service was very nice.  We had to laugh when we ordered cause orange juice was $ 8.00 for a small glass, all I could think was it doesn't come with a shot of vodka?   One egg, 2 strips of bacon and toast $ 24.00. I think that is expensive. Pleasant and nice service but live and learn.",,,Good
"Their service was excellent also. Located right at the main entrance to Caesars Palace, it is open 24 hours a day. Fairly fast service on the food, especially since it was pretty busy. I had a BLT, which was on thick sliced grilled bread and very tasty and fresh ingredients. There also had a nice variety of choices on the menu. I would eat here again.",Good,Good,Good
I ate dinner there which was not bad. I also ate breakfast there. The breakfast food was decent but for the high price they charge for orange juice they could at least serve it in a regular size drinking glass instead of a small jar.,Good,,
"Timely and cordial service, good menu, good breakfast with large portions, properly served. A little expensive for breakfast.",Good,,Good
The food here was very good and the portions are HUGE!! Try the huge meatball it is an appetizer but is enough for a meal. Not cheap but well worth the price due to size of servings!!,Good,,
"Absolutely delicious pancakes, fresh squeezed Orange juice, and breakfast burrito. It was amazing, but pricey. OJ was $10, pancakes were $20. Big portions of food, which was nice.",Good,,
Cafe Americano is located in Caesars. Old school breakfast. Pricey but Good. Interesting fact:  if using comps you pay tax unlike other properties,Good,Good,
"Went to eat at cafe Americano after seeing Absinthe. Seated, offered a drink, ordered, then incessant banging commenced. New flooring was being laid in the restaurant. No prior warning had been given when we were seated, which given the fact we couldn't talk without shouting was shocking. Our food arrived, missing some of the order (we didn't bother asking for it) I spoke to the waiter who offered no alternative table just to box our pizza. ""If I'd have wanted take out pizza I'd have ordered takeout"". Can't believe to poor service in what I assumed was a decent hotel. Clearly I was mistaken. I appreciate work has to happen but warn your guests, close the restaurant, offer some discount or apology. Don't leave guests disappointed.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"When we arrived there was no one at the Hostess Stand and waited several minutes for someone to show up.  By that time there was quite the line.  Once Seated, we were greeted with water and our waiter introduced himself.  It was about 20 minutes before we saw him again.  It took about 20 minutes to get a drink from the bar.  Once I received my food I did not see my waiter again for about 30 minutes.  There were no refills at all.  The food was OK but the service made this a place I will never go again.  The food and service in Vegas overall is outstanding and this was the ONLY place I had a negative experience.  I would not recommend this restaurant because there are so many other options that have better food and superb customer service!!",Good,Bad,Bad
"Ordered food here at night and had to wait for almost an hour. The restaurant was dead, but for some reason my food didn't come out until I repeatedly asked someone. Servers seemed distracted and not interested in helping. I think because they know they will always have business, they don't care about service. Save your money.",,Bad,Bad
"My friends and I were looking for a place on the strip to eat outdoors and stumbled across this gem. We weren't expecting too much, but we were pleasantly surprised!


We sat on the outside patio which at dinner time was perfectly shaded with a bar, lounge seating, and tables. I got the Jumbo Black Tiger Shrimp Linguini which if you're looking for a pasta dish... YOU HAVE TO GET! My friends got the Grilled Mahi-Mahi and the Grilled Free Range Chicken which were also really good.


The servers were also very friendly which made our experience all the more positive. Prices are pretty much what I would expect for a Vegas on Memorial Day weekend. We liked it so much we ended up going back a second time later in our trip for a late night snack!",Good,Good,Good
"Visited 6/10/16 for breakfast.  Cafe Americano is located just off the lobby at Caesars so it definitely is convenient which is why we stopped in.
Service and food was very good, but I just can't justify a $25 omlette and/or a $25 plate of pancakes.  I wouldn't go back, just due to prices.",,,Good
"Having struggled to find anything decent at the hotel we were staying at, we found Cafe Americano while on walk about and chanced an evening meal. It turned out to be a good choice. The food was good, and the menu reasonably varied. The service was good and during the meal a manager or equivalent came to our table to check all was ok. I saw him doing this with all tables while we are there and this certainly made us feel our custom was important and feel welcomed. Good all round.",Good,Good,Good
"While spending an entire afternoon and evening at Caesar's Palace before going to Absynthe, we decided to enjoy a nice dinner at Cafe Americano.  Unfortunately our server made an error on what my wife ordered twice (once in what she ordered and when she wanted her soup) and he had the nerve to literally challenge her on the order as he leaned across the table at us.  Then when the food finally got there he chicken was so dry she could not eat it.   At this point his attitude was so bad we simply paid the bill and left.  Cannot believe that at no point in our time there did we ever see or hear from the manager.  Very disappointed considering the $30 price tag for a sandwich and fries.  Expected way better service along with Good.   Many other choices, would recommend ANY of them.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"If I see Eggs Benedict on a menu, I usually order it.  I have to say the Eggs Benedict at Cafe Americano at Caesar's Las Vegas was the best, repeat best, I've ever eaten.  Nice smoky Canadian bacon, perfect hollandaise, and eggs poached to perfection.  The crunchy side of hash browns were the best!  Wish we had dinner our first night at Cafe Americano instead of the buffet.  I'll be dreaming about this restaurant.",Good,Good,
"Staying in Caesars Palace, this restaurant was within a stones throw.
The super-friendly staff were a delight and a credit to their company.
Open 24 hours, an early morning coffee was a heart starter, with the added 
advantage of not standing in a 10+ minute que as one had to with their competitors.
If you're looking for a great meal; unpressured friendly service, I recommend
this cafe restaurant.",Good,Good,Good
This is a great place to eat while staying at Caesars. Service was great (Keith) and the food was very good. I recommend this restaurant.,Good,Good,Good
"We went here for Breakfast and it was great, very busy place right by the hotel reception. Great menu with all you need 24/7",Good,Good,
"I ate lunch here twice on a recent business trip to Las Vegas. Both of my meals were very good. I had the Tigertail Shrimp Pasta on one occasion and the Skinny Stir Fry on the other. You can't go wrong with either dish. Service was also prompt, friendly and efficient. I think the food is pricey but it seems to be typical of the new Las Vegas!",Good,,Good
Staff were rude and food was terrible. Don't bother eating outside as the staff think they're above speaking to you. We went for dinner before a night out and were told by a member of staff that wasn't doing anything to order at the bar if we wanted food quickly. Then we spent ages just being stared at for a $70 meal I could get better at wetherspoons.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"Had a wonderful lunch there. Service was awesome and good was delicious. Giant meatball and hummus as apps were great as were our entrees of Asian chicken salad , steak and eggs (they have all day breakfast item selection on the menu which is a great idea for Vegas ) and piizza marguerita. 


Great place to eat and people watch into Caesars main lobby. Are their twice. Open 24 hours. Met Mario, the manager, who was very gracious and welcoming. Runs a top notch operation here.",Good,Good,Good
I was very busy the weekend we were in Las Vegas. The wait for seating and to receive the food was a bit long. The service was excellent and the food was good.,Good,,Good
"We had a drink and wings the night before as a pre dinner snack and decided to give it a try for breakfast. 
My mojito was a little sweet but the wings were good. 
Breakfast was not. Our food took forever to come out. The omelette was mediocre and room temp. The hashbrowns were cold. Pancakes were warm but dry. I ordered banana pancakes and they just put some bananas on top. The bacon was delicious however. 
Fortunately we weren't as bad off as the people next to us. They had been waiting longer than us and asked to speak to the manager. 
Side note, I was wearing black pants as this was business breakfast meeting and they didn't have any black napkins. I couldn't use the white one because it was linting all over them!


Two breakfasts and a coffee for $90 not worth it. Go around the corner to the Payard Bistro. Staff is great and the food is way better!",Bad,,Bad
"Overpriced,  food was marginal.  I think they took the potatoes off the breakfast buffet, they were cold. Coffee was cold",Bad,,
May be the nature of the joint. I had Breakfast and dinner at this place. Place was very noisy during dinner. Food is Good.,Good,Bad,
"We ate here for breakfast. There was a short wait but we were able to immediately sit at the bar. Large tv and clean decor. Nice bartenders. 
Drinks, even coffee was expensive. Order took a little time and one of our four was incorrect, server ordered different item. That took time as well and he just said ""don't kill me"". My husband was watching a soccer game when the tv changed to a vacuum infomercial and was told it was linked outside. He told him it was an infomercial and the bartender said he'd look into it and never did.
The captain crunch French toast was great as was the eggs Benedict and pulled pork hash. The hash browns were soggy. Everything was at least 22 dollars each. Very overpriced.
Food was good but not worth the cost and poor service and mistakes that were ignored.
Skip it",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Had a great breakfast here. Pancakes were big, fluffy, and ""Good"". Good attentive service. Long lines mean Good. Expect them.",Good,Good,Good
"Was here for breakfast only, so cannot attest to the rest of the 24 hour menu.   Seating was quick and courteous, and food came quickly.  The veggie hash was great.  Nice to be able to people watch while drinking coffee or waiting for your order.",Good,Good,Good
"We selected this caf√© twice for breakfast. Service and food was very good. The portions were large. The presentation the food on the plate was very appealing.


Will be back.",Good,Good,Good
Came here a couple of times for a few pints. Service was always great and the atmosphere was awesome since it is in Caesars lobby. Nice looking patio but it wasn't warm enough to relax outside at night. This will be one of my first stops when I come back in May.,,Good,Good
"On our recent trip,April 2016,we stopped in for a quick bite,before seeing the Matt Goss show. Our waiter Alex S,was on top of his game,they should clone this guy,for every place in Vegas. The manager,Carlos,stopped by our table and asked how the food and service was. I was very impressed with both. There is a reason this place is always packed and their menu has something for everyone's taste. I recommend their pizza and the chicken tortilla soup.",Good,,Good
"My husband and I stopped here while looking for food fairly late in the evening.  We'd heard good things about it and were interested to try it for ourselves.  We ordered a cheese pizza to split between us since we weren't super hungry, and honestly, the food was quite good.  The main reason I rate it so low is that our server was not very polite and paid barely any attention to us the entire time we were there.  Maybe it was because we didn't order a lot of food, but I still found it frustrating to watch our server check on all the tables around us three or four times without once coming by to see if we needed drink refills or to even ask us how we were enjoying the meal.  We only saw him when he took our order and again to drop off our check.  Our drinks and food were brought out by someone else.  I probably wouldn't go back, but if you are looking for a place to eat late at night, the food is worth a stop if you are willing to chance the poor service.",Good,Bad,Bad
Was not up to usual standards for this cafe. Have eaten here many times and always enjoyed my meals. This time however was a let down. Both my steak and my cousins were way over cooked. They did re-cook them but left the sides for us to eat. So by the time the steaks showed up we were kind of full. Thankfully we stayed at the Vdara so we had a kitchen. We took the dinner rolls and ate them for lunch the next day as sandwiches. The flavor was good but I've had better. Price was great for the strip.,Bad,,
"This is the 24 hour restaurant/bar in Caesars Palace near the hotel registration.  I ended up coming here for breakfast my last morning as Serendipity wasn't open early enough for me to go there and still catch my flight.  I had the waffle with fresh berries and some coffee.  


Overall, it was a decent experience.  A little pricey but, come on, you're in Vegas and at one of the higher end hotels.  If you want a cheap meal, go somewhere else.  Service was pretty good and while it seemed busy, I got a table (just me) right away.",Good,Good,Good
"Great food at a fair price, not cheap but very good overall, ate breakfast here and they had healthy choices.",Good,,
"Had breakfast two days here and both were delicious! The service was excellent, large servings and clean. Had the bacon& eggs each time and left feeling ready for the day!",Good,,Good
"Came here with our friends for an early dinner and ate inside.
Our waiter, Silvano was attentive and very knowledgable about the menu.
Our friends had the burgers and fries and the burgers were huge!
We had the Angus sliders and the spaghetti & meatball, which was the biggest meatball I have ever seen; had to be 1/2 a lb.
Everything came out hot and correct.
Nothing is inexpensive here so you need to be prepared for that.
Atmosphere was nice and music pleasant.
Would come here again.",Good,Good,Good
"Prices are a bit steep: beer on tap is overpriced. Cocktails are typical strip pricing. 


Okay. That said. $19 for wings. You're thinking ummm. Really? Keep in mind it's not THAT high for Strip pricing. And they are GOOD. Their house buffalo sauce is fabulous. Cooked extra crispy. So tasty. All the wings are big too. No pitiful puny things. Again. When you're in need of food late at night this'll do the trick. 


I prefer to sit at the bar when here late. Service can be a bit slow and spotty on the dining room floor. 


Bartenders make a wicked not-too-dirty martini. Try a signature cocktail too.",Good,,Bad
"We have been to this restaurant a few times. We had always sat inside at the main bar, but this time we sat outside simply to enjoy the warm weather.  We will never do this again.  The outside is grungy (we're not sure why Caesar's doesn't smarten-up the entire outside area between the strip/bellagio and this Caesar's entrance. We 'get' that there's a 'look and feel' that go with Absinthe...but to be honest, this entire area - which could be really nice - is just dismal).  Cafe Americano is the first restaurant you encounter once you enter Caesars from this side, and inside it's VERY  nice. The staff are very good and the food is very good INSIDE.  But the abbreviated outside menu is not good (we had 2 apps (shrimp and fries) and both were greasy and overcooked (they came out so fast, we think they were already cooked and sitting in bins mcdonald's style).   I won't even mention the Hookah service.   It didn't affect us...but again, feels more absinthe than cafe americana. Out of 3 bartenders, only 1 was attentive.   One was somewhat attentive to some guests.  But a third (female) bartender spent the ENTIRE time flirting with the manager. As in - awkward for the customers - flirting.The manager was so COMPLETELY obnoxious with his 'close talker come stalker' treatment of this bartender (who gobbled it up) that we went from being annoyed to determined to sit there until one of them finally came up for air.  When they did, the female bartender simply took our payment and went to the cash register, where the 2 of them then continued their romance.  The good bartender noticed this and apologized. We asked if the tall man with the female bartender was a manager and the good bartender embarrassingly confirmed.  We said 'we are formally voicing our disappointment'.  i certainly hope they move the 'good' bartender inside so that we can tip him next time we visit (because it was even more annoying that the flirting female bartender, who never waited on us, processed our tip).  Like we said...this is a good place INSIDE ...just avoid the outside altogether.",,Bad,Bad
This is like an all around caf√© /bar popular especially for breakfast and late nite. The food is usually very good especially the breakfast menu. Service has been average to better on my many trips. Price is up there but not outrageous.,Good,,Good
Cafe Americano is a hidden gem! The food is traditionally diner. Good breakfast that is plentiful and well prepared.The service was excellent and the manager Carl appeared to really want you to have a Good as he was active on the floor. Price is higher than a traditional diner but your are not cheated.,Good,Good,Good
"Myself and my two children went here for breakfast on Monday morning whilst staying at Caesars Palace. We ordered three pieces of toast, i think I had English muffin, kids had toast and three drinks, it came to 74 dollars. My daughter ordered hash brown, we had to ask for it twice as it never turned up, when it did arrive I asked not to pay as we had finished out meal, they obliged and deducted it from the bill. Overpriced, rubbish service there are so many better places just across the road.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We ordered spaghetti and meatballs and it was absolutely delicious! I loved the sauce. You get one meatball but it is HUGE and delicious. I wish I took a picture of the meatball. The spaghetti and meatball dinner was quite expensive at $26.00 (no soup, salad or bread included) but that's Caesars and I don't mind paying if the food and service is excellent which it was. We also ate breakfast here; the All American Breakfast ($22.00!) included eggs, potatoes, toast and choice of bacon, sausage or ham. It was good and fresh. This restaurant is very pleasant and has an upscale feel to it.",Good,Good,Good
"I loved the food, this place is just awesome. A simple place but good quality of food and care, your hospitality is simply holistic and true. Thank you for your Good",Good,Good,Good
"At the end of the day, just relaxing with a few hours to wait before our flight, stopped off for a quiet drink.  The bartender was very friendly and efficient.  It was a nice spot just to chill before the airport trek.",,Good,Good
I had breakfast three mornings in a row.  The staff and food was amazing.  I couldn't believe how fast my food arrived after ordering.,Good,Good,Good
"This restaurant is open 24 hours, so it is a great place to go in the evening.  The portions are huge, so you may want to share a sandwich if this is your late night snack!",Good,Good,
"In the lobby for Caesars Palace, so the location is great.  The food for a Cafe is two things you would not expect at a Cafe - Delicious & Expensive.


I was looking for a quick burger and fries for lunch (I never order burgers back home in Canada, but always in the US as you can choose how you would like it cooked).  I was expecting a $10-15 burger, but nope, $26.  I forget what my wife had, but her food was good too, albeit pricey as well.  


Don't get me wrong, in the end, I wouldn't say I was disappointed, because the food was good, just surprised I would say.  Service was good until it came time to get the check and pay, as it seemed to really slow down.  When someone is ready to go, they're ready to go.  


All in all, if I was staying at Caesars and felt lazy I might go back, but I highly doubt it.  Food as mentioned was good, but not good enough to go back at that price.",,,Good
Had breakfast here a couple time and apps another time.  Food was good but expensive.  Very loud restaurant. Service was good.  Convenient location in lobby of hotel.,Good,Good,Good
"Great breakfast to be had here, but lost one star because the smoked salmon on my eggs benedict was cooked hard (I presume because it had been sitting under a hot lamp or oven as it was waiting to be served) ... Other than that, everything else like the waffles, crab egg benedict, French toast etc. were great. 


I also came in for a snack and had the most excellent wagyu beef sliders.",Good,,
"I dined here twice during my recent stay at Caesar's Palace, both time for breakfast.  
On the first morning I had I believe what they called the All American Breakfast.  The bacon was cooked perfectly, the eggs were a bit underdone, I asked for over medium, they came out over easy, the potato has was excellent and the icing on the cake was they had a really great gluten free bread that made excellent toast!
While you pay a premium for breakfast, over $30 with tip, I can tell you that the portion was ample enough that I only need a small afternoon snack before dinner so all in all a good value.  Service was attentive and friendly!",Good,,Good
We stayed at Cesar's and had breakfast here. Very nice atmosphere and reasonably priced. Everyone took good are of us and the food was great. This became our spot to get coffee in the morning and the place to grab a cocktail to go before going outside at night.,Good,Good,Good
"My breakfast at Cafe Americano provided a great start to the day. The fruit was a unique mix of berries, melons and other fresh fruit and my omelette was full of onions, peppers, ham and cheese. My only complaint would be that it seemed a bit pricey.",Good,,
Went there for a business breakfast on a Thursday morning.  Service was slow and it wasn't very busy.  Tried to get just plain waffles but you could only order them with bananas or other fruit.  This is how they justify the price. With so many options in Vegas I wouldn't repeat,Bad,Bad,Bad
Maybe I ordered the wrong food. I had a rib eye. It was thick and juicy but the meat seemed a bit tough at times. I am willing to give their food another try nextime.,Bad,,
"We met a customer here for breakfast and it is a noisy environment, almost hard to have a conversation without repeating yourself. The price is high, we paid $125 USD for 4 people, even higher when you are Canadian and need to consider the exchange rate.
The breakfast was good, delivered quickly and the wait staff was efficient and professional. Coffee and water were refilled often which was great. 
Book reservations, it is a busy spot for breakfast. The majority of the clientele are there for business,.",Good,Bad,Good
Enjoyed a dinner and a breakfast while I stayed At Caesar's. I found the food very expensive but portions were big and service was good.,Good,Good,Good
"The serving size of the breakfast sandwich was perfect to split and delicious.
The waiter seemed irritated with us for not ordering more and when I asked for almond milk or soy for my coffee was told ""sorry, we don't have that.""
The person assisting the server heard my request and quickly brought some soy milk for me - guess he wasn't as concerned about our small $$$ order!",Good,,Bad
"The food, even if was half the cost, would not have been worth the price. My wife and I went because she was hungry and we were seeing a show at Caesar's Palace. She got the Margherita pizza, which was pretty solid, but my meal was not good at all. I got the grilled free range chicken off of the skinny menu and it was bad. The chicken was dry, way over cooked, and stringy. I literally had to put some water in my mouth while chewing to soften it up. The asparagus was bland and chewy to the point I had to cut it in individual pieces to swallow because it was not al dente and my teeth couldn't cut through it (and I have some respectable chompers).  The brown rice was good, but hey, I never met a plate of rice I didn't like!  Overall, it wasn't good, and given the price, it was downright bad.  Go elsewhere and spend your money.",Bad,Bad,
"This restaurant is near the main lobby of Caesars in Las Vegas.  We went for a late night meal and it served a full menu even in the wee hours of the morning.  Food was good, service was just ok.  Certainly served its purpose as a late night jaunt, but doubt I would go for a proper dinner.  Especially in Caesars which has some of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.",Good,,Good
"I checked out this place this morning before my wife was up. I told here it must be good because looking at the prices, it either has to be or they are just super proud of their food. $75.00 for breakfast is a lot, but the breakfast I had was well worth it to me.",Good,,
Not cheap relative to other fancier rest.  Had salmon which was ok. Clam chowder soup wa shoot but had ham..   My Friend had a steak which was very good,Good,,
"Cafe Americano is a convenient spot for breakfast if you are staying in Caesars Palace as it is right in the registration lobby. Service was quick, friendly and attentive. Food was delicious albeit pricey:  Scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage and toast with tea was almost $30. 


Will come here again and recommend it.",Good,Good,Good
"Great place that is open 24hrs!!! great place to take breakfast with an awesome service!!! 
CONGRATS!",Good,Good,Good
"We went to the cafe shortly after arriving to Vegas.  We were promptly seated around 11pm (late and the restaurant was not full).  We waited for 10 minutes to get asked what we wanted to drink, another 10 minutes to get the drinks (again it was not busy in there at all.....).  The food saved this experience for me, the hot wings were very good as was the pizza.  
We witnessed 2 other tables walk out after not getting service from the waitress after 10-15 minutes.  
Honestly had the food not been excellent, I would have rated this Terrible.  Considering the location and the price this was a fail for me.  Doubt that I'd be back, you'd have better success at mcdonalds or BK for a fraction of the price.",Good,Bad,Bad
"We came here to have a quick drink while we waited for our reservation at Bacchanal. Its Vegas, so as expected, things were a bit pricey. We were starving and couldn't really wait for the buffet especially with people having food delivered around us, so we ordered the short rib nachos and oh.my.god. Literally one of the best things I ate while on the strip, I still think about them to this day because no plate of nachos has ever satisfied me like those did. I do remember service being less that great, but didn't take away from the meal. All in all a great choice, I'll be back for those nachos VERY soon.",Good,Good,
This is an overpriced place to eat for average food. The reason we liked it so much is all the bartenders were all very nice and offered advice on several things during our stay at Ceasars. Just a great bunch of young guys who enjoyed talking to customers and we really enjoyed having drinks here because of them. Thanks guys you do a great job.,Bad,,Good
"The food was good and the waiters attended us well. The price is s bit too high for what you get, but then it's in an expensive hotel.",Good,,Good
"Kinda an average hotel caf√©, but the food was a bit elevated.  It is one of those places that is open 24hours, and a great place to pop in for a quick bite while you are running around the resort.  Super casual and super easy.",Good,Good,
"We always attempt to try the Caf√©-type restaurants in each hotel we stay.  Again, Wynn so far has everyone beat for their caf√©.  In this attempt at a great breakfast, Caf√© Americano was our choice.  We were staying at Caesars so why not.  It was a late morning breakfast, it wasn't extremely busy, the wait staff were excellent so what could go wrong.  The food looked good but lacked any heat (temperature wise) and it was a bit pricy for cold food.  Our mistake was not saying anything to the staff.  I'm sure they would have made it right but we were in a hurry for another engagement and couldn't wait for the heating process.  I guess we were expecting hot food initially, not as an afterthought.  We may try again on future trips out but first impressions are hard to shake.  Price and cold food will more than likely point us to other offerings.  Sorry Caesars but for a great weekend in your establishment, this was the only blemish.",Bad,Bad,
"Considering the amount of choices in Caesar's Palace, this place was rather unremarkable.  It's a good choice if it's the middle of the night and you are hungry as it's the only 24 hour restaurant.",Good,Good,
"Limited beer selection outweighs its front door convenience, IMO.  Yes, there are stools available and the service is friendly and attentive.",Good,Good,Good
"Had breakfast here on our first day as we waited for our room.  When we arrived there were plenty of empty tables but we were told none were available.  I of course pointed out the empty tables and was told people were waiting for them, except there was no one waiting, hmmmmm.  We were told we could sit at the bar with no wait so that is what we did.  The entire time we were there the tables remained empty.  We ordered breakfast and it was less than stellar. The home fries were loaded with peppers, maybe they were on sale.  The hash browns were very greasy and bland.  Eggs, bacon, and toast were fine.  I asked for warm water with lemon and the waitress couldn't get it right 3 times.  I kept getting boiling hot water or ice water, go figure.  They are not on the cheap side but it is convenient as it is in the lobby of the hotel and they are open 24 hours.  Wouldn't really recommend unless you're starving and you happen to be right there and can't wait to go elsewhere.",Bad,,Bad
"Coffee shop in Cesars Palace Lobby, grab a coffee, fruit or smoothie. There were many other options on menu (I just didn't try them).",Good,,
If you're staying at Caesar's Palace then I'd fully recommend using Cafe Americano. Great friendly and efficient service. Loved it!!,,,Good
The smoked salmon benedict was delicious as were the bloody marys! The pancakes are HUGE and the omelets were very good.,Good,,
"Caf√© Americano is located just off the registration lobby of Caesar's Palace.  We were three couples, staying at Caesars, and just wanted breakfast.  The place was busy when we walked in (always a good sign), and people seemed to be enjoying what they were eating (another good sign), and the food looked wonderful with large portions (two more good signs).  Then our waiter introduced himself and gave us our menus.  What??  Sticker shock for breakfast!!  Never a good sign!


While the menu was varied and complete it was just priced for jackpot winners - not you're average visitor. I had pancakes (no meat), and my wife had the Continental Breakfast (muffin, yogurt, fruit), and we each had coffee.  Total with tip $60.00!!  Our friends had two egg dishes - their bill was almost $80 - for breakfast!!


OK, we went, we ate, we paid our bill, and now we're home.  I'm not crying, but the whole point of TripAdvisor is to let you know about places we have visited.  So now you know.",Bad,Good,
After watching Absinthe we popped in here for dessert.  So much goodness and we couldn't even eat it all.,Good,,
"Just checked in and was a bit desperate to find the first food place. Around midnight I came in here not expecting much....surprise. attentive wait staff, and HUGE portions. I don't think 2 adults can even finish off one burger with fries. On that of that, it was really good. So that's about $25 bucks to fill up 2 adults yeah go for it.",Good,,Good
"Had breakfast here one morning- amazing Belgium waffles, huge serving size- for 2 would have been better to share this and a fruit salad",Good,,
"We spent the day at the Qua spa and needed a brunch spot between gym and massages, so stopped in here since it was close and they didn't care that we were in gym clothes. I had the Bananas Br√ªl√©e waffles, which was amazing with br√ªl√©e flavored whip cream and carmelized bananas.  Perfect and not too heavy.  My husband tapped into his inner child and had the Cap'n Crunch French Toast with a variety of berries on top.  It was more than he could finish and he said it was very good too.  Not cheap, but it's Vegas.",Good,,
"We ate at Cafe Americano at about 9:30 on a Sunday night. The restaurant was pretty much empty. Service was good and our food arrived quickly. The BLT's were excellent. Lots of smoked and chipotle bacon on grilled sourdough (the menu listed brioche, but we were happy with what we got) with fried green tomatoes and herb mayo. While expensive for a sandwich (just over $20), the portions were huge and we could have easily shared one sandwich. The side salad had good house vinaigrette but the salad part was boring. The fries were very good. Overall, very happy with the food and had Good.",Good,,Good
"My mom and I walked around most of the morning and we were pretty hungry by the time we stumbled upon Cafe Americano at Caesars. First we sat at the bar since you can order food there too, but the bartenders were too busy attending to 2 tipsy blondes' needs. So we decided to ask for a table on their outside patio, only to find out later that the menus are different inside vs outside (pretty silly if you ask me). We finally got a table inside and even though the cafe was pretty much empty on a Saturday, the service was nonexistent. Our waitress didn't show up for about 10-15 minutes to get our order. The food was yummy, except for their grilled mahi mahi which was too salty. The skinny flat iron steak fry was very tasty and filling. For the prices they have, they should definitely step up their service game!",Good,,Bad
"Food was just ok, portion size was generous but prices were high considering quality of food. I'm sure you can find something better.",,,
"This place was open 24 hours and although not cheap like most things in Las Vegas.  The service was prompt and efficient, portions were generous and the smoked salmon place was of great quality.  Very convenient location at the lobby of the hotel.",Good,Good,Good
"This is THE 24 hour cafe inside Caesars Palace, so to be expected the tab is going to be high.   That said, our breakfast meals were very, very good.  Service was excellent and the quality was high.   Sure, it was only a Denver omelette, but it was fluffed and folded perfectly.  Onions along with red, green, yellow peppers were sauteed perfectly and the smoked cured ham was trimmed of all fat.  Lot's of hash browns and nicely toasted English muffin.  So yes, expect to pay a bit more, but it's better than standing in a cafeteria line for all-you-can-eat sitting-in-the-pan bacon, eggs and waffles.",Good,,Good
"Beth the service and food was fantastic, but we had sticker shock at the prices for breakfast items, etc.   We loved our waiter!  The cafe is very convenient as we are not buffet diners when we can help it.",Good,Good,Good
The meals here are good (not great); service is above average. The pricing is their downfall - the prices are very much out of line with other options in the immediate area. Go to the Bellagio (next door) or Harrah's (across the street) for far better value.,,,Good
This restaurant is open 24 hours a day and we had a late night snack at 1 a.m.  The sliders were terrific.,Good,Good,
"The restaurant was not particularly crowded, but we waited at least 15-20 minutes with no service, that should have been a sign of worst things to come.
We didn't order much, each had the Lump Crab Cake Benedict and a glass of orange juice.  To our dismay there was absolutely no lump crab at all, it was all bread filler.  When we pointed it out to the manager, he agreed to speak with the chef and do something about it, however he never came back.  Our bill came to $71.35 with tip, the most expensive breakfast we've ever had.",Bad,,Bad
"Well, it was good enough to go to twice during our 3 day stay!  We had great food, great service and never had to wait more than 5 - 10 minutes for our table.  It's super convenient and the prices are in line with everywhere else both in Caesars and on the strip.  If you can get a table close to the lobby, it's very fun people watching too.",Good,Good,Good
We had breakfast two mornings.  Portions are very ample and my wife and I shared an omelet.  Great servicer's and food.,Good,,Good
Very good place to eat and it opens 24 hours. We have breakfast couple of time here and the quality is very good with big portions. Service is ok. Price is a little high.,Good,Good,Good
"I attended a meeting in Las Vegas last week, and I stayed at the Caesar's Palace. I thought I would have an early breakfast before my meeting, and I decided to try Cafe Americano. I arrived at the restaurant before 7am as I wanted to enjoy my breakfast before my meeting. I was directed to a table near the entrance by the door staff. Next, a waiter came to take my drink order. I got my coffee within several minutes, and I waited for the waiter to come back to get my breakfast order. Unfortunately, I never saw that waiter again, and I noted that people arrived after me were getting their meals delivered to them, but I didn't even get a chance to order mine! After 15 minutes, I decided to ask another waiter to take my order. This new waiter was very apologiectic, and prioritised my order. Finally, I got my breakfast within 10 minutes. The food was okay and certainly nothing to rave about. I was very tempted to not leave a tip, but I did in the end because of the service from the other waiter. I finished my breakfast at 7:45am, and I witnessed that the patrons were waiting for quite a long time for a table despite the fact that the restaurant was not even busy! 
I did not dine in the restaurant again during my stay, and I would recommend to go to another breakfast restaurant in Caesar's Palace.",Good,,Good
"Service was okay, food was fine. I wouldn't make a special stop.
While this is centrally located in the hotel, make an effort and go to Hexx kitchen at the bottom of the Paris instead for a great street view.",Good,,Good
Open 24 hours. Excellent breakfast. Very busy restaurant at Caesars entrance. Good breakfast meeting spot. Caution reservations are limited and wait can be 15 to 30 minutes.,Good,Good,
"If you want to enjoy a quiet and tasty meal, come to the Cafe Americano. Good for pre shows. Wonderful menu and accommodating service. Located across from the hotel registration desk.",Good,Good,Good
Loved eating at Caf√© Americano at my stay in Caesars Palace in Las Vegas this past week.  I was particularly surprised at the great service we received and the friendliness and efficiency of the managers Alex and Gerardo.  Its so nice to be able to have a great dinner in a more reasonable and convenient restaurant in Caesars and not to have to make reservations!  The guacamole dip was the best I've ever eaten and the breakfast was awesome and plentiful each day.  I have to say that I have been to this caf√© many times during past stays at Caesars and I have never received the kind of service we received this time.  Kudos to the managers and staff!,Good,,Good
"Keep in mind this is a 24/7 restaurant in one of the major hotels in Vegas.  We went for breakfast at 6:45 AM and were told that we couldn't be seated for 10-15 minutes because they only had ONE server on the floor.  We looked around and there were 10 tables with customers and at least 100 tables empty.  We left to go eat elsewhere.  When we realized Caesar's Palace only has one breakfast place open at that time of day (seriously?) we went back.  We were seated and got coffee.  We asked for creamer.  The server never came back with creamer or to take our order.  After waiting 15 minutes we walked out.  This is the worst experience we've ever had in Vegas trying to get breakfast.  Caesar's should be ashamed of themselves and the managers (of which there were many standing around watching this all happen) should be fired.  Also, a stack of 3 plain buttermilk pancakes is over $20 so it's also highway robbery.  Don't waste your time!",Bad,Bad,Bad
Try the giant meatball! We shared it as an appetizer between 6 and we e had plenty! Also the steak and egg wrap was wonderful for breakfast.,Good,,
"We knew breakfast at Caesar's Palace would be overly expensive but that was OK with us -- we came for a morning of soaking in the atmosphere, playing a few slots and having breakfast.  My Denver omelet and Bob's pancakes were both very good.  They each had unexpected little extras -- real maple syrup for the pancakes and jams in those cute little glass bottles.


Our waiter was so charming!  He took the time to listen to our stories of Las Vegas ""in the day"".  He listened and asked questions about us seeing Frank Sinatra perform at Caesar's in the 1970's. He was a true gentleman.",Good,,Good
"Loved the sausage and toast to go in the morning and staff are super fast! Always a busy place when we passed several times a day to our room. People eating, drinking and chatting, very relaxed place",Good,Good,Good
"Breakfast for one person is $33 (including a $5 tip). Nothing special, nothing fancy. Maybe the ambiance. No complaints. I checked in at the hotel and was looking for quick breakfast. I knew it was going to cost more than if i scouted around. But again, i wanted something quick. Food was ok.",Good,Good,
"Went in the evening, 10ish, the staff were friendly and worked at giving Caesar's level service. The restaurant itself is very much a ""cafe"" with average food very reminiscent of a Dennys",,Good,Good
This cafe in the one of the lobbies at Caesar's Palace is a good choice for a quick meal.  We stopped for lunch and shared a sandwich which was more than enough food.,Good,Good,
"Note, this was a fairly expensive breakfast ($37 with tip). But Caesars is not an inexpensive place (you want coffee in your room? $28 please). The food at this venue was awesome! Service was top-notch. Attentive, but not intrusive. I actually ate at the bar, as the restaurant was very full. This restaurant is adjacent to the lobby. Open 24 hours. Beautiful decor. The only drawback was the price.",Good,Good,Good
The food was really good. Service was nice - several people waiting on the same tables. Cost is high but not many more options around.,Good,,Good
"Over the past nine years, this lobby-side caf√© at Caesars Palace has had at least four iterations - new names, new menus, new d√©cor.
What has not changed is the atrocious level of service incompetence.
Two breakfast orders- basic stuff like coffee, tea, juice, eggs, bacon, toast- produced FIVE errors!  Then to try to correct them is nearly impossible.
Slow service, slow kitchen, worthless busboy, barely adequate waiter.
Then a check for about $80 plus tip.
Every time I go to Caesars Palace, I promise myself I will not go back to this dump.  Maybe this time I'll learn.
But if this place were on Main Street of any town, they'd be out of business in 90 days.
Stay away.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Good for a quick snack or bite.  Food quality for this type of outlet was very good.  Service was efficient and friendly.,Good,,Good
"Service was great but the food was very bland. I ordered scrambled eggs, sausage and toast. The portions are huge and I made do by adding lots of pepper but there wasn't a lot of flavor.",Bad,,Good
"Located off the registration lobby of Caesar's Palace, we had our doubts about Cafe Americano.  True, it had the hustle and bustle of the lobby but both the service and food we're very good.


I had a classic hamburger while partner had a chicken sandwich.  We had chicken wings to start.  All were good but the wings were really good - even to a Buffalo native.


If you need a quick, good lunch at Caesar's, Cafe Americano is a good bet.",Good,,Good
I really enjoyed the late night dinner here. They were out of some drinks or I would give them excellent.,Good,,
"I ordered the fish and chips and I liked it more than Gordon Ramsey's fishnchips.


The dessert was awesome but expensive (I think it was $18)


Service was poor - worst after a week of eating in restaurants and mostly in Caesars.",Good,,Bad
"We had flown in to Las Vegas from Honolulu on a 6.25 am flight via San Francisco and arrived at Bellagio at around 6pm. We were meeting up with our son and daughter in law who'd flown from Australia that day and then driven from LA to LV so we were all tired but wanted to have a drink and something to eat before crashing for the night. They were staying at Caesars Palace so we met there and they suggested Cafe Americano because it's right there in the lobby.
The ""welcome"" from staff was offhand despite the restaurant being virtually empty ( a bad sign in itself at 7.30pm on a Saturday) and we were seated and then abandoned for a while. We eventually were able to order cocktails and the drinks were good.
I had the calamari and 2 crab cakes and the others had the salmon, crab cake, tuna tartar and ahi tuna. All were ok. The Jordan chardonnay we had was good. We probably didn't do the place justice as we were all tired but the meal was really nothing special. Service remained reluctantly amicable throughout. The bill for 4 came to $309 including $127 for drinks.",Good,,Bad
Ate breakfast here most everyday. Great service and food. They are open 24 hours everyday. A little pricey but very covenant to our room.,Good,Good,Good
"A great bar to have a beer on your return from trekking around ! 
Sit down, take a load off and watch the world wonder by while drinking an ice cold bud ! 
Some Good here too, tasty and fun to eat while sat at the bar ! 
 A bottle of Bud at around $7-8 and a sandwich with fries at around $20.",Good,,
"I just went in for desert, husband ordered a meal. The food was good and the service was friendly.  It was a bit pricey, but then again the days of cheap buffets in Vegas seem to be a thing of the past, so it wasn't a big surprise to pay $14 for a piece of cheesecake.  It was a delicious treat, and was vacation after all, so... the Cuban sandwich with salad was fresh and pretty authentic.",Good,,Good
"Here for a business trip, as I walked into Caesar's Palace the caf√© is just to your left. I was dubious but I sat down and ordered some breakfast. I ordered the New York breakfast sandwich, it was the largest sandwich I have ever seen in my entire life! It had a huge amount of eggs, ham, bacon, and cheese on a Kaiser roll with a huge portion of hashbrowns cooked perfectly.
I sat at the bar, my server Kristina was wonderfully nice, she was very attentive and made a fresh pot of decaf coffee for me. While I was sitting there she even offered to plug in somebody's laptop when the battery was low.
The prices are high, but not really much different than any other restaurant in the casino. But the amount of food you get for the price makes it more than worth while. Two people could easily share a breakfast.
I was here for work, so I'm normally not a big fan of Caesar's Palace, but this restaurant inside the casino is top notch.",Good,Good,Good
Ate here for breakfast twice. It is right by the lobby so it is convent to get to but expensive ($44 for breakfast). Food was good but service was spotty,Good,Good,Bad
We had breakfast service was a bit slow again but food is good and fresh made so this makes up for it.,Good,,Bad
Had a lot of brunches here as we found the breakfast menu  to our English taste.  Good portions and happy service.,Good,,Good
"Nice service, breakfast was good but not amazing. Coffee was fresh, hot and very good. Enjoyable place to people watch.",Good,Good,Good
There were many tables available for breakfast. Didn't understand the line to wait to be seated. Menu selection is minimal and overpriced. Food was bland,Bad,,Bad
Was at the casino in Caesars late night early morning with no choice but this Cafe for small bite to eat... Nice place but why so overpriced?! Really $8 for toast???,Bad,Good,
"My husband and I were looking for a place to eat.  This restaurant is located by the entrance to Caesars Palace so we thought we would try it.  We were seated immediately but that was the only fast part of this lunch.  We waited for approx. 15 minutes for the waiter to ask us what we wanted to drink.  We told him and ordered guacamole.  He brought out drinks then took our order.  About 20 minutes have gone by.  Our food came out in approx. 15-20 minutes.  No guacamole was ever brought to us.  We asked for straws and it took our waiter 10 minutes to bring straws.  We needed our water refilled.  I asked the waiter for refills.  We waited and waited.  He looked at us, shook his head then came to fill our glasses.  I won't recommend eating here because of the wait times.  I rated this restaurant at 2 because the food is good.",Good,Bad,Bad
Good place for breakfast when staying at Caesar's Palace. Convenient location across from the Caesar's check in desks. Food is reasonable good. Service is excellent. You can eat quickly or at your leisure. The menu is quite extensive.,Good,Good,Good
Good ambiance and service. Just off the Lobby at Caesar's.  Had an excellent Asian chicken salad and my niece had a Cuban Sandwich that was very good too.,Good,Good,Good
"My wife and I had a late breakfast / brunch here. The food, the service and the overall atmosphere were absolute quality.",Good,Good,Good
"Didn't enjoy the food at all. Very over priced. Small servings. No, tiny servings. Flavour just not there. Convenient, that's it.",Bad,Good,
"Open 24 hours. Service was average for breakfast 2 mornings. $14 for oatmeal w very small amount of cooked apples on top ???
Omelettes were >$22 and our breakfasts averaged about $45.",Bad,Good,
We visited this restaurant after a late night.  We ordered pizzas.  My margarita pizza was inedible.  And the service was terrible.  We waited an hour for our pizza while everyone around us was already served.  I believe the water forgot to turn in our order.  Very unhappy being this was the only restaurant left open at late night Caesars.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had breakfast here on our last morning in Vegas and had a pleasant experience. They were very busy so it took a bit to get our drinks, but all in all the food was delicious and the service mostly attentive.",Good,Good,Good
We had a lovely breakfast here whilst staying at Caesars. Portions were huge and the coffee quickly refilled. The service was excellent and we aren't used to breakfast feeling so special. It was certainly a great start to the day...,Good,Good,Good
"Loved the fact that this restaurant is available 24 hours a day.  We stayed at Caesars, went to a concert, out late and hungry. So glad to see this restaurant was open; ordered and totally happy with Cafe Americano.  The food was terrific; the staff was friendly; it was clean and bright (right near front desk at Caesars) and totally a very pleasant surprise at such a late hour.",Good,Good,Good
Ate breakfast there -- had the breakfast sandwiches and they were really good.  Had to flag down waiter twice to get a coffee refill and never got a water refill.  Breakfast is about $25 per person.,Good,,Bad
"We were looking for a good old ""coffee shop"" for breakfast and unfortunately many of the cafe have been closed.  We noticed the Americano in Caesar's Palace.  It has a great menu with all your breakfast favorites.  It even has old fashion hash browns, crispy and golden brown!!  Not cheap, but worth every penny.  Great food and service.  We will be back.",Good,Good,Good
Open 24 hours...so this is a good place to stop whenever.  We had a late evening dinner one night.  The service and food was good.  Be prepared to spend a bit more that you think...but it's Caesar's.,Good,Good,Good
visited this place for breakfast during my stay and was very much happy to what i had and what they say typical american breakfast  . excellent staff and they treat you well so nothing much more to say,Good,,Good
"Visiting for breakfast, the first thing to say is that the service here is very good; our server was very helpful and willing to explain everything and take an awkward order. 


The breakfasts are huge, so be prepared to be very full; the food is high quality and very tasty. 


This restaurant is the kind that you want to take your time and enjoy a lazy breakfast; there is plenty of space between tables so you don't feel crowded.


Whilst it is not cheap, it is worth the cost.",Good,,Good
"This place is really easy to find as it is across from the oversized registration desk at Caesars. The food was good but the service is excellent which makes for a good place to meet for a business breakfast. I would not come here as a destination, but it is fine if you need a place in Caesars.


TIP: This place is expensive - $20+ for a simple omelet.",Good,Good,Good
"I had the All American breakfast...perfect size/satisfying...my SO had the Cuban breakfast...he was very pleased....and the coffee, was sooooo good.",Good,,
We enjoyed Cafe Americano.  My husband had a reuben sandwich that he said was very good.   I ordered a pizza and it was pretty good.  The fries however were ice cold.  We did not send them back but we should have.  This would have been an easy fix.  The staff was also very nice!  Breakfast seems expensive but dinner is reasonable.,Good,,Good
Worst cheeseburger ever.  No idea how one screws up a cheeseburger so badly. Only ate a few bites because I was worried the meat might be bad,Bad,,
"We went here because we really felt like lox and bagel. The price of $26 dampened our enthusiasm, but then they were out of salmon, so we left. The breakfast buffet which only cost a little more ($30) was fabulous.",Good,,
"As others have said, this is a 24-hour restaurant in the lobby of Caesars Palace. I had breakfast there one morning. I considered oatmeal, but not at the price of what it costs to be a full case of Quaker Oats. I settled for a waffle with orange juice. It cost what I could feed 10 people almost everywhere else. The waffle was OK - nothing special and certainly not worth the price.",Bad,,
"This is the 24 hour cafe in the lobby of Caesar's. 
We were not expecting much, as this is a 24 hour cafe.
Gone are the days of cheap eats at any of the strip hotels, but prices here were crazy for breakfast.
Oatmeal $14, Eggs/bacon/hash $21, Steak/Eggs $35...WOW.


Walked right in at 8am on a Friday morning
Typical table setup for a cafe. Very spacious, tables were far apart. Even though this place has not been open long, it needs paint and a more regular cleaning schedule. Chair legs, windows, floor all needed mopped/cleaned. I was surprised how grungy everything UNDER the table was. Above the table had table cloth, neat settings, and very crisp napkins. We looked past what was below.


We had...
Salmon Benedict $27. Moist smokey salmon, perfectly poached eggs, ample sauce on an average english muffin. It was above average.
Huevos Rancheros $24. Looked good and wife said was very tasty. Eggs were cooked well, but it wasn't spicy enough for her tastes.


Overall the food is better average, but not worth the price. You can do better in Vegas.",Bad,Bad,
"Good dining option if you are wanting something for anytime of the day. The short rib steak meal just melted in my mouth and the Banana Split dessert was heavenly. Prices were quite reasonable and not outside even budget conscious diners. There is something for pretty much every taste, from pizza to finer dining options.",Good,,
We stopped here on our last day at Caeser's Palace for breakfast.  At 7 AM There was only one waiter for the area where we sat.  He worked extremely hard and was very professional.  The food was good with large portions.  My major complaint was the price.  $20 for a waffle! Wow.,Good,,Good
"We ate here one morning as it was one of the only places open for breakfast in Caesars Palace.  Our other option was Payard Patisserie, which is quick pastry food.  We were a party of 3.5.  So we opted for a sit down meals since we flew in the night before.  The food was delicious.  I had the biscuits and gravy.  It didn't taste like traditional southern style, but it was pretty amazing!  We all enjoyed the meal and it felt good to sit down in a bright (natural lighThe only drawback was the price.  It cost $85 for breakfast for the three of us.  I know it's vegas and everything is just more money.  So it was a bit of a blow for us to spend that much, first thing in the morning!  I think it wouldn't have been as bad if Caesars had other breakfast options.",Good,,
"A HUGE improvement over the restuarant that occupied this space before (Central Michel Richard) !


Highly recommended for grabbing a bite late at night ! I highly recommend their Rib Nachos !",Good,Good,
"It was busy and bustling. All the sights and sounds of Las Vegas at check in time. This was a quick business lunch and I chose the grilled salmon from the ""skinny"" menu. It was cooked perfectly and the brown rice was excellent. The carrots were cooked to crunchy and flavorful. The ""skinny"". menu had some good choices and of course the rest of the menu was expansive. The waiter was diligent and didn't need to wait too long for the food. The ""scenery"" was, as always, entertaining...but this is Las Vegas after all :-)",Good,Good,Good
"Stopped in here late night - place is open 24 hours - and had the wood fired pizza, which was really good and fairly priced in my opinion (for pizza) some of the other menu items seemed a bit high, but everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their meals.  Server was spot on and was quick to refill water glasses, we had the Lychee martini, pricey but delicious.  Various food options to choose from.",Good,Good,Good
"A very average restaurant ordered Caesar salads very dry no bacon no lemon no anchovies completely tasteless no punch I doubt if the lettuce was fresh a bit limp and hard pressed to see any cheese
Smoked salmon was ok but had to ask for lemon and no pepper mill on table
Ordered lobster bis but never arrived",Bad,,
"I needed something to eat in a hurry to hadn't yet discovered the Forum Food Court in Caesars, so I stopped by this place (because it's in the lobby and one of 1st places you see... plus, it is open 24 hours). I ordered a BBQ chicken breast sandwich. The chicken breast was thick and juicy, grilled very nicely and basted (not drowned) with BBQ sauce. I could've done without the horribly over-fried onion ring on top, but it was a a really good sandwich overall. The fries weren't bad either.  


The staff here does the bare minimum. We decided to eat at the bar instead of take it to go and not once did anyone stop to offer us napkins/condiments or ask if we wanted a drink.",Good,,Bad
"Went here specifically for breakfast and would definitely not recommend Cafe Americano.


The food was very average for the price - talking $21 for some eggs, toast, and potatoes. The servings weren't anything to talk about for this price, and there are many BETTER places to eat on the strip than here that are cheaper. I can understand the convenience of eating here if your staying at Caesars, but trust me, eat somewhere else!


Our service was good so I can't complain about that - we were brought warm milk which was exchanged no problem no hassle, waitress was nice and accommodating.


For two guests it ended up costs almost $60 bucks. I rather eat at Planet Dailies in Planet Hollywood.",Bad,,Good
"Service was good, waiters attentive. The price of breakfast was so exorbitant we determined not to return. $24 for 6 slices of toast!!!!! The menu isn't too great for visitors, very American type of 'crappy' food, I am referring to the type of food, not the quality of it. It has such potential for where it is, right opposite check in. We would have eaten there every morning of our 5 day stay if the prices were reasonable. Will not return. We went back for dessert last night and some of the menu items were not available, so we left. Stay away if you are on a budget.",Bad,,Good
Went for late breakfast on a Saturday. The wait was not too bad. The menu was very good with all the traditional items like eggs Benedict but they also had variations on the theme. Very Good. My eggs Benedict was very good and my wife loved the corned beef hash. Others had omelettes. All portions were huge and could easily be shared.,Good,,Good
"Very expensive, but as expected for the lobby of Caesars Palace, Ate breakfast here one morning, if couples are dining, sharing a meal would be plenty for two. Portions are large. Excellent food.",Good,,
We had breakfast in Caf√© Americano at Caesers Palace. Service was great and the food was really delicious and a nice surprise. Prices were around average for a breakfast but the food was worth the money.,Good,,Good
"We had a delicious breakfast at the Cafe Americano.  Cafe Americano is the ""main"" sit-down hotel restaurant situated right in the lobby of Caesars Palace.  While nothing was ""excellent"" service was slow but very friendly and food was expensive but delicious.  We paid around 70 for breakfast (no alcohol) for two.   This consisted of two american breakfasts (eggs/toast/bacon) and we shared a muffin plus coffee.  Apparently it's difficult to order anything not on the menu (management rules) our server had to ask permission for us to order a single muffin which is normally part of the continental breakfast, etc.  I also wish they had soy or almond milk as I would have also ordered the house-made Granola which looked great.  So,while not perfect, Cafe Americano is one of the better places on the strip for regular/casual fare in a sit down environment.",Good,Good,Bad
"I finally has a chance to stop by Caf√© Americano on my last visit to Las Vegas. The menu had plenty of options and the food plates going around looked great. I ordered the Fried Calamari, which was a bit on the chewy side. Enjoyable if you like the ""crunch"". I also had a burger that was cooked nicely but the roll was dry and flaky. Seems like the meals are cooked on a way to high heat measure which can over cook things and should be timed a little better. We stopped in again for a quick breakfast that was really nice. But $$$ for eggs and bacon. The one benefit is that its open 24hrs.",,,
"We enjoyed breakfast here - it was tasty & I loved the coffee. Staff were polite and efficient. 


I would definitely return.",Good,Good,Good
"Huh, I don't think I've ever done a TripAdvisor review where only 3 people have reviewed before!  Obviously this is one of the less frequented (for sure, less reviewed!) places in Las Vegas.  However, I'd be remiss not to comment on it.  We hadn't planned appropriately and tried to get into Bacchanal Buffet with a very teeny tiny window of time before our show ...not sure what we we thinking!  Even with the hostess agreeing to squeeze us in, there was no way we were going to get in, and out, of Bacchanal in time for the curtain, and we thought we'd better grab something quick before the show ... passing by Cafe Americano, it looked quiet, it looked pleasant, and we were hoping it was quick ... so we popped in. As we had ""wasted"" a bunch of time in the buffet line, we realized we only had time for something quick, and ordered some appetizers.  Our server was very good, first of all - he noted we had show tickets and he made excellent efforts to get us in and out quickly, without making us feel rushed.  Our nachos were nice, with a shredded beef, and the calamari was done well, also.  As there were very few people in the restaurant when we were there (about 7:15 or so on a Wed. evening in July), it was peaceful.  It ended up being a solid plan B, last minute choice.  Pricey for simple appetizers - but then again, what isn't pricey in Vegas?",Good,Good,Good
Stopped for a late supper our first night in Las Vegas. The only thing on the menu that is meat free is the spinach/artichoke appetizer. The Caesar salad has anchovies in the dressing. The French onion soup is made with beef bones. The wedge salad is topped with bacon bits. $14 for an iceberg lettuce salad. Wasn't worth it.,Bad,,
"This was out 'go to' spot for grabbing something to eat late at night...sandwiches, burgers, etc. Always great staff, and the food was very very good (and reasonably priced for Vegas).",Good,,Good
"This place is very underrated.  Service was great, food was delicious and it has a very cool atmosphere.  Modern vibe but not too loud like some places in Vegas.  Try the crispy rice sushi sampler.",Good,Good,Good
"My husband and I were able to grab two seats at the bar for dinner on a Friday night without reservations. Nice big square bar- plenty of seating. Service won‚Äôt be as good as table dining but nice & casual and the food is the same. I enjoyed a tasty Sidecar to sip on while we shared the Caesar salad & Waygu Carpaccio. It had a nice presentation and the aioli accompaniment was flavorful. 
For dinner I had the Chilean Seabass with mushrooms - a few too many for my stomach but the Seabass was prepared just right. My husband had the 6 oz. Fillet with asparagus & truffle mashed potatoes. All very good.  Overall a nice dining experience.",Good,Good,
"My husband and I were both celebrating birthdays and chose to dine at Jean Georges about two weeks ago since we have been to Aria many times before and never tried it. I wanted to write a review to say what a wonderful experience we had. We sat in the bar area at the high top tables, which were beautiful marble (we loved the decor in the restaurant). Our server Jill was absolutely amazing, one of the best servers we have ever had at any restaurant. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and recommended several dishes to us including the butternut squash soup (one of the best soups I‚Äôve ever had), an excellent steak, the sea bass (melt in your mouth). All the food was delicious and she was super attentive the entire meal even though she was the only server in the entire high top area. We were so impressed. She also had a great attitude and was so kind. We had such a great experience I actually asked to speak to her manager to tell her what a great job she did and that we really enjoyed everything so much. At the end of the evening we had the molten cake dessert and it was the piece de resistance, so delightful, and so unique. We had such a good time we told our friends to make reservations the next time they come to Vegas in a few weeks. Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great service, delicious food and a nice atmosphere.",Good,Good,Good
Top Steakhouse in Vegas im Aria. Great products and exemplary service. Nice pleasant ambience and fantastic wine list,Good,Good,Good
We absolutely enjoyed our dinner here. The atmosphere was so relaxing and nice. Great service and even better food!  We will definitely go back next time we're in Vegas,Good,Good,Good
"We were staying at Aria, where the restaurant is, so we decided why not eat somewhere at the hotel without having to take a cab elsewhere.
We had a reservation but it didn't look like we neede done per se, the restarant was not crowded.
We started with a nice glass of red wine each, which was delicious. If you are not comfortable paying more than $30 for a glass of wine, don't bother looking at the wine list.
We each had steak and I went for the wagyu beef, because I'd never had it and I figured why not treat myself wince were in Vegas and all. My steak was small and it cost more than $130, but I have to say it was delicious and came with fourr dipping sauces. My wife and I also split a ceasar salad (they actually split it for us). The salad was great! We enjoy a good ceasar and frankly they are bland at most restaurants. We also split a baked potato. Between all that and the bread, everything was outstanding and the perfect amount of food. There's no ""taking it home"" when you are staying in a hotel, after all. 
Food and service were very good.",Good,,Good
"I was disappointed in the steak. Even though it was cooked rare, it was dry. The sides for baked potato was only sour cream and chives, no cheese, no bacon bits. Their tea brand had changed and tasted like peach tea. Prime at Bellagio is much better.",Bad,,
"Phenomenal steakhouse experience. Splurged for the 3oz wagyu and it was by far the best steak I‚Äôve ever eaten in my entire life. The sides were impeccable.  Cocktails were a plus.


The service by the waitstaff was incredible. 


Love the ambience of the dark wood and dim lighting.",Good,Good,Good
"Very elegant setting, perfect service. A pan briosche with butter is served as a truly memorable entree. The meat from 10 and praise. Try the truffle mac&cheese! High prices but in line with the place and justified.",Good,Good,Good
"I went here for an early dinner.  I had two servers.  The female was very slow.  But the male server hustled and tried to cover.  The food was great.  A wedge salad, shrimp cocktail, and a ribeye with the bone.  All were perfect.",Good,,
"2nd time we eaten there, but it never gets better. Service is top notch, but food is just average. For the price you pay you would expect a top notch steak and food, but I have had better at half the price.",Bad,,Good
"I thought Jean George‚Äôs Steakhouse was mediocre at best. Had the 18 oz bone in ribeye that was cooked properly but had very little flavor. No char marks and lots of fat and gristle. Also had the bacon wrapped shrimp that were very dry and Brussel sprouts tat were tough and hard !!
The wedge salad was good and the mashed potatoes were awesome. 
Service was very good and my Manhattan was great. 
The food was not good for the price. For $87 the steak should be sensational !!",Bad,,Good
"We enjoyed our meals and time here , service was good and friendly. One of us ordered a starter of Wagyu carpaccio , we nearly needed a microscope to see 4 tiny pieces of wagyu , the Wagyu measured about a square centimeter each x4 .
We enjoyed our meal and atmosphere but disappointed with the very small quantity of Wagyu called carpaccio!",Bad,Good,Good
"We all had salads couple appetizers and the pig Wagyu tomahawk. It was very nice very good ended up spending $1700 meal was probably worth half that at best very overpriced. I‚Äôve had much better steaks.
Not to mention dealt with the rudest bartender I‚Äôve ever met in my life. His name was Darren if you see him and he‚Äôs working that night run I will post his picture.",Bad,,Bad
"This place doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Great atmosphere, friendly servers, and outstanding food. This is one of the restaurants that we keep on our list whenever we go to Vegas. 


Let‚Äôs start with their buttery and soft bread that they serve. It‚Äôs really hard to eat just 1 piece. My ultimate dish there is the Japanese Wagyu Carpaccio. There‚Äôs 4 servings per order and I can easily eat the whole plate on my own. It‚Äôs basically thinly sliced wagyu beef on top cheese fritters with creamy truffle aoli‚Ä¶..flavor explosion in your mouth! 


Their crab cake is good and so is their steak. You have to save room for their chocolate dessert. I cant remember the name but it was served in big round white chocolate sphere and the server will pour hot chocolate to open the sphere.",Good,Good,Good
"It is a very nice steakhouse.  The bar serves tasty cosmopolitans!   I had the New York strip and loved it - my husband had the ribeye and was very disappointed.  Brussels sprouts very good.  


The setting and the service were great.  Food prepared perfectly, but for the money the ribeye should have been of better quality.  If we would have ordered something else I may have given it 5 stars.",,Good,Good
"Held a business dinner at Jean Georges while at a conference in Las Vegas.  Was expecting excellent service and delicious food to make our clients relaxed and receptive to business discussions.  Unfortunately, our server did not want to work that night.  He only asked about drink orders once.  When we tried to get his attention for another round, he seemed displeased and literally only took drink orders from half the table and the left!


There was never requests for appetizers or desserts.  Such a shame as I would have been happy to provide a generous tip but the payment process was a nightmare and our server never returned to ask if we needed  any help with the machine.


To top off the entire experience, the sea bass one of the clients ordered was undercooked but because our server was incognito, the client simply ate side dishes.


Please stay away from this restaurant.  There are so many better ones in the Aria.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This was a great place to enjoy Christmas Dinner! The service was great and the food was exceptional. The server made great suggestions, which did not disappoint!",Good,,Good
"Ok beyond expectations, service food all of it was beyond expectations. The authentic Japanese wagyu was phenomenal, cooked to perfection. Service is so attentive i think we had 5 different server each responsible for their own area of dining, the milk bread was really good, salt crusted potatoes, foie gras all of it perfectly executed. Not the big names tv chefs and it was better than those i mean to die for!",Good,,Good
"Me and my son took my dad here for his birthday. The service was incredible and the food was delicious, they made his dad feel special and he loved it, definitely will be back.",Good,Good,Good
Food was good but don't come here If you're celebrating a birthday. They don't bring anything out for desserts. I noted on my reservation celebrating birthday. But they did nothing to celebrate my husband's birthday.,Good,,
The atmosphere is amazing. The server was so kind and attentive. The food was fantastic. Filet perfection ! Carpaccio amazing. The drinks were spot on. Even the music was awesome.,Good,Good,Good
"When we are in Vegas, we always like to go to a steakhouse.


We were at Jan Georges last year and loved it.


And of course we went again this year.


But this time it was a disappointment.


The starters were OK, I love the bone marrow, my wife had the char grilled octopus.


It was really excellent.


But the real reason we came, the steaks, were a disappointment this time.


There were no hot plates, my steak was lukewarm, my wife's


ice cold.


I ate mine, but my wife sent hers back.


We didn't have dessert.


The Heritage in the Mirage or Gallaghers in New York New York are much better.",Bad,,
"The Restaurant ambience was nice but the waitress ‚ÄúShannon‚Äù was the worse. The hostess seated my party of five and never explained the tablet for drinks. After waiting 15 mins for a server I finally flagged down someone for assistance. Our waitress arrived with a horrible attitude that ruined the vibe all night. She asked what we wanted and didn‚Äôt explain the dink menu, regular menu or if they had any specials. I hated she even had to come to the table because her attitude was that bad. Her two support servers were nice and a breath of fresh air for giving us bread and refreshing any drinks. She really ruined my experience there. For the amount of money you pay to eat there you would expect a five star server.",,Good,Bad
"We normally stay on the other end of the strip, so we thought it would be fun to try some new places. In town for a concert so this was our one night out. We had a big lunch and upon being greeted by our server and ordering she was verbally annoyed with us that we were sharing an appetizer and a salad. After we ordered a table of 8 was sat to our left and a table of 6 to our right. Both immediately ordered several bottles of wine. Our food arrived properly coursed but we never saw our server or her 2 server assistants again. We had to flag someone down for the check. $300 for two people in only an hour isn‚Äôt going to yield you a terrible tip off a two top but it was obvious we just weren‚Äôt worth her time compared to her other tables. We paid with cash and I asked to speak with manager on the way out. She was a shy woman who could only say she was sorry and that wasn‚Äôt their standard. Clearly it is. Won‚Äôt be back and certainly won‚Äôt recommend unless. Oh and to add insult to injury, the ‚Äúmelt in your mouth‚Äù steak was dripping in butter so much that‚Äôs all you could taste and my husband was in the bathroom half the night.",Bad,,Bad
My daughter and I ordered filet mignon medium rare - they came out medium but was still tasty. My wife ordered king prawns which she enjoyed.  Chips portion was enough to share between 2.  Service and general ambience was ok.  Overall it wasn‚Äôt bad but we‚Äôve had much better for a lot less money.,Good,Good,Good
"We went to Jean Georges with great expectations and were very disappointed.  Seated and menus did not arrive for at least 10 minutes.  While once ordered, our food came out timely but our waiter never came back to check on our food‚Ä¶.the mushrooms lacked flavor and were chewy,  scallops lacked flavor,  the potato just was not my liking and the steak lacked flavor.  On top of that no offer to refill our drinks.  For over 300 for two people we will never go back.  There are so many better options!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We visited this restaurant last Thursday night, meat was not what we were expecting, flavorless. 


Service was ok, but they had to bring the check three times cause they kept adding drinks we didn‚Äôt order. I‚Äôm glad I checked the ticket.",Bad,,Good
"Excellent meal, best steak so far in Las Vegas. My husband ordered the steak with their different sauces which he couldn't stop talking about. Cooked to perfection. I ordered the crispy chicken with fries, I was not in the mood for beef so went with the only chicken dish on the menu, I did end up removing all the breading on the chicken since I preferred it grilled but the part that I ate was very good. The fries were super crispy. A little disappointed with the dessert menu, since Jean George is french, I was expecting french desserts and not apple pie and cheesecake, but ce la vie .
Most definitely recommend it.",Good,,
"Nice atmosphere, but over priced for the quality of food. Staff tries to push the most expensive items on the menu.",Bad,Good,Bad
Food was okay service was terrible! Saw my server Eddie grope the hostesses neck multiple times than continue to serve plates without washing his hands.Our food and drinks took forever to come out will never come back!,Good,,Bad
"The resturant inside is very clean and pretty. The service was slow and the food was not seasoned.
I would not recommend, go to stk, GR STEAK, or HK",Bad,Good,Bad
"We had a very nice dinner my. The place is clean, the music is not loud so we could chat nicely. The food is expensive but üëç‚ù§Ô∏èüíã",Good,Good,
"Top notch service but food is way overpriced for what you get and while the presentation of the food was stellar, half the food came out cold and not edible. Sent one entree back and it came back mushy and again, inedible (sea bass). My wagyu filet was fantastic and the highlight of the meal but the rest was pretty subpar and not worth the dollars involved.",Bad,,Good
Very expensive for what you get. The service was fine and the ambiance was good. The place was packed.,Bad,Good,Good
"Great food and great service. It's pricey so don't go looking for a cheap steak but the food is very good. At our table we had several different steaks and a burger that was fantastic.  Steaks were cooked properly, the burger was to die for and the sides were all unique and tasty. If you need a place to take a customer in Vegas this is a great option.",Good,,Good
"After a failed dining experience at Gordon Ramsey Steak, we sought out another steakhouse to have a better evening. Luckily we obtained a same-day booking for Jean Gorges. The restaurant is beautifully decorated. There is a vibe but it's quiet enough to enjoy your food and have a good conversation but not awkwardly silent. 


The servers were excellent and attentive and knew the menu well. I forked out for a delicious Wagyu steak and it was truly exceptional, and memorable. The accompanying side dishes were amazing too. I ordered a pavlova dessert and it was exquisite and delicious. The wine was well-priced with a varied selection. Highly recommended!",Good,Good,Good
"This review is for the single people or couples without reservations. I highly recommend that you sit at the bar and have dinner. I had such an awesome experience for dinner. I went and sat at the Bar and my server was simply amazing! 
First, service was prompt. Secondly, when I was not certain which red wine I wanted, he gave me a tasting of 3 amazing wines, brining out the bottles and giving me the notes, tasting and brief history of each - along with his favorite. I have to admit, the one I initially liked was not as good as his recommendation. His recommendation was Faust Cabernet Sauvignon and it was beautiful (others tasted Duckhorn Merlot and George Pinot Noir).


For dinner, I ordered the New York strip - medium and that was done after much discussion. I really wanted the bone-in ribeye but didn‚Äôt think I could eat 18ozs. My side was the Saison Battered Maitake mushrooms (I wasn‚Äôt crazy about that and I should have ordered the Salt Crusted Baked Potato).


I would 100% recommend this restaurant for awesome service and food.",Good,Good,Good
"High end steaks are the not-surprising starts here, and they aren't disappointing. The space is sleek and modern, without being too noisy. Service is very good (maybe not perfect, but very attentive), and ALL of the food is great. The steaks are cooked perfectly  and the wine list is wide ranging. Nothing is cheap, but it's JG in Vegas so what do you expect? The steak menu has A5 Japanese beef (fantastic) and some unique cuts from domestic sources (like an 8oz ribeye cap - yum). Best to go with a group and sample many items. Enjoy.",Good,Good,Good
This restaurant was packed and very very expensive. They had a hamburger on the menu for $48. I had the sea bass for $53 which was the cheapest thing on the menu. A baked potato was $21. The service was nothing extraordinary. The wine menu was extensive. I just felt the prices were outlandish but that‚Äôs Vegas for you.,Bad,,
Had dinner at the bar. Service was friendly.   Food came promptly and was excellent. Great steak- didn't need any sauce at all- very tasty- drinks are great as well as desserts. Go have a great meal,Good,,Good
"Enjoyed valentines/anniversary dinner with our friends. Atmosphere was nice, service impeccable, and food good.  Gave roses to all women. We ordered the 50 plus ounce steak to all split, price was not on menu. When bill came the steak was $500!!! All sides are separate price as well.  We enjoyed our dinner but that was officially the most expensive meal we ever ate! It was a special occasion for us, but still way too expensive. Not sure average person can enjoy nice meals in Vegas anymore . Making everything Way out of reach! . ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",Bad,Good,Good
"Came here for dinner as a group of 6, expectations were high given the places reputation. Atmosphere is very cool and elegant, among the best in Vegas. Service is great too. Food & Drink? Started with a Negroni cocktail that was a bit too strong, had a jumbo shrimp cocktail, excellent! Bone in rib eye was a bit overcooked hence not so awesome, spinach as you would expect. Steak came with 4 different sauces to share, tasty but tiny! Each one was about the size of a coffee spoon portion, no clue what that is about. Winelist is long but far too expensive,  only 2 Napa Cabs in the 150s space, had 2 bottles of Newton and then a final Newton at about USD460. The issue is that all bottles got served way too cold resulting in flat flavour and taste. All in all a good evening and experience, but for the coins we dropped there are better choices in LV.",Good,Good,Good
"We made reservations for this restaurant skeptical after reading the reviews. But boy are we glad they were wrong. We had a wonderful dinner with  rice crusted tuna (very thick cuts), sea bass with the largest maitake mushroom I have ever seen and husband had the filet. We also added a side of truffle mashed potatoes which are not on the menu but you can ask for them. Everything was delicious and our waitress and team were fantastic. I also highly recommend the orange & elderflower cosmos. Best cosmo I've had. We will definitely return.",Good,,
I have now eaten at this restaurant on 3 different occasions. My Wife and I cannot seem to find anything on the menu we like except for the meatballs. It is a shame as the restaurant has a great atmosphere.,Bad,Good,
We had a wonderful trip to the Aria for a quick Fall getaway and decided to splurge with a great steak and meal at Jean George's Steakhouse.  The service was wonderful and the ambiance was great (although when first seated it was very cool in the restaurant but our bodies adjusted lol).  The steaks were very average; the brussel sprouts were tasteless and not cooked properly; the macaroni and cheese was lukewarm and so-so...honestly blown away by the sub-par food in contrast to the high prices - even high for Las Vegas!!  The Wedge Salad was essentially a loose pile of iceberg lettuce with milky Blu Cheese Dressing dumped in the middle of it...very disappointing! The service was exceptional however. We didn't complain at all since it was a comped meal...but really - there has to be better places then this in Las Vegas!,Bad,Good,Good
We go here for special occasions . Service and steak is perfect . Ambiance is great for a quiet date night .,Good,Good,Good
Went last night. I had the Colorado bone in rib-eye and it was pretty good. Everyone else in my party had the Colorado New York strip and they all said it was tough. One out of three was overcooked.,Bad,,
"Expectations were high but the food was just OK. The steak was without any real wow factor and again just average. Based on the many options I would look at Mastros, STK and others if you are looking for a Steak dinner.",Bad,,
"The resturant was beautiful and the service was good however the food was just average and for the price it just was not worth it.  We ate the ceaser salad, Wagyu and Kobe.  Steaks were just ok which at that type of venue should of been amazing.  Good wine selection.  Dined at STK two nights later and far preferred it.",Bad,Good,Good
"We came here for a corporate dinner so it's nice to have everything paid for!  Excellent service and food.  We had a private booth so it was nice to be able to hear each other talking.  Our waitress was very knowledgable and helpful.  We started with the Wagyu Carpaccio which was an incredible burst of flavor in your mouth!  I started with the iceberg wedge which was good but since when did iceberg lettuce cost $20?!?  I had the F-1 Wagyu New York 10 oz cut and it absolutely melted in my mouth.  I've never had such a delicious steak!  10 oz was more than enough for me.  Topped off with a passion fruit flower dessert, which was a white chocolate flower moulded like a flower with caramel and praline inside.  Surprisingly not overly sweet!  Everything was great and I would go back...but only on someone else's dime!",Good,Good,Good
"We ate at this restaurant in August 2022.  I had picked this establishment due to them having a Wagyu rib cap.


Everything about the meal was delicious.  The stand outs were the crispy sushi sampler and the Wagyu rib cap.  I would go back just for that sushi appetizer at the bar!


We also enjoyed a couple cocktails each - I really liked the Blood Orange Cosmo.


The service here was really good.  The ambiance is nice - you are in a darkened setting.  It's not an overly large place.  Also, thank you to the staff for acknowledging my birthday - the macarons were delicous! 


We really enjoyed our experience here. I would recommend this place to others - make sure to try the sushi appetizer!",Good,Good,Good
"Excellent experience with great service. For starters, the brioche bread and butter were absolutely amazing. Then for appetizers, I had some of the best beef carpaccio and bone marrow with toast points ever. Warning, the bone marrow is quite large. Another warning, we ordered the deliciously tender wagyu tomahawk ribeye (48oz with the bone) carved table-side, and the four of us barely finished it. The carajillo put a nice ribbon on the end of a great evening. Last warning, this steakhouse is quite expensive, but I think quite worth it.",Good,Good,Good
"We had one of the best meals we ever had. Remarkable food and excellent service. Expensive, but hey, we were on vacation.",Good,,Good
Unfortunately don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be back. I ordered the wagyu filet and there was actually part of it I couldn‚Äôt eat due to grizzle. We loved the Chilean sea bass and the spinach. The mushrooms were not well cooked and without flavor. Atmosphere too bright- there was a spotlight on us from above which is not very flattering. Wine list is great and we enjoyed our choices.,Bad,Bad,
"We ate here seven years ago and remembered the quality of the food and the great ambience, and it hasn‚Äôt changed.  Perfectly sized menu with great steaks",Good,Good,
"We visited the Steakhouse this weekend while staying at ARIA for the first time. It was absolutely delicious. The bread and herb butter is the best I‚Äôve ever had. My husband and I both had steaks cooked perfectly. We also had the truffled Mac-n-cheese. It was melt in your mouth cheesy. For our birthdays, they brought us a chocolate lava cake with a white chocolate ball that they poured hot chocolate over until it exploded. Not only beautiful but absolutely heavenly. We will be back!!",Good,Good,
"Not only is the food absolutely incredible but the service was better than most of the michelin star restaurants I've eaten at. Rachael, Nate, and Elizabeth went so far above and beyond to make the best experience possible. While it may be on the expensive side, the experience was worth even more than what we paid.",Good,Good,Good
"What a fantastic last dinner in Vegas. 


My husband and I made a reservation here last minute and couldn‚Äôt have been happier!


Rachel and Nate took such good care of us and didn‚Äôt mind us taking our time. 


Stellar steak and salmon!


Cheesecake and apple pie desserts were amazing. 


Even the drinks were delicious and made with real fresh ingredients. You can tell nothing is fake here. 


Best meal before an amazing show - silk sonic with Bruno mars and Anderson Paak.  


Jean George‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt disappoint!",Good,Good,Good
"Wicked expensive, but well worth it. We had a large group and everyone loved their dishes from the filet, NY Strip, and sea bass. We had a fantastic server, Rachel. She was very warm, friendly, knew the menu inside and out. The filet was perfectly cooked with a wonderful crust on it, but moist and buttery inside. The sides are meant for 2, and all of them were delicious especially the truffle macaroni. The dessert was probably are least favorite, we went with the recommended lava cake and it was pretty good, but not outstanding like we expected.",Good,,Good
"Fantastic experience in our recent dinner at Jean-Georges before attending the Lady Gaga concert.
Great ambiance in what has to be one of the classiest dining rooms in Vegas. 
So many celebrity chefs have failed in maintaining their high standards when opening restaurants in Vegas. Not so Jean Georges. They have a class act operation here. 
Their service was among the best we have experienced in any restaurant in Vegas (Joel Robuchon included_). The food was well prepared and delicious. The fact that they change their menu seasonally is terrific.
Cannot say enough how impressed we came out after our dinner here. This is now one of my new favorite places in Vegas., and I am not generally a big fan of steakhouses.",Good,Good,Good
"Are here to celebrate my wife‚Äôs 50th. The Cosmopolitan was well executed and was the greatest highlight of the dinner. The Chilean Sea Bass was good but the accompanying mushrooms were way to dry and not worthy of being on the plate. My Colorado Filet Mignon arrived as a New York Strip- given how the evening was going I figured I would try it as I knew it was only $1 more. The medium well that was ordered arrived very undercooked. My first thought was how relieved I was I didn‚Äôt get the Wagyu at $65 an ounce. Given the celebration it was something I considered but glad I changed my mind. The tomato salad and ice berg were very good and executed well. The most odd thing was the random arrival of a slice of cheesecake for my wife for her birthday. We were not given options and we had already planned on ordering the Market Citrus. After the slice of cheesecake arrived I was not asked if k wanted anything and no offer as to if we would like coffee. Unfortunately, my wife doesn‚Äôt like cheesecake so the nice gesture came off as odd and left us a little confused. We ordered the Market Citrus to go so we could have a dessert that we actually would order. As my wife went to use the bathroom as service came to a grinding halt I was impressed when the bill arrived and they had all my information to bill the meal to the room. Unfortunately, when my wife returned I learned she was stopped on the way to the bathroom and asked how we wanted to pay for the bill and gathered the room information. What I thought was impressive work it added more disappointment as it came off as tacky. I was seated at the table the entire time. Instead of properly asking how things were prepared, what dessert would we like if any, and even if we wanted coffee, and asking about the check at the table the experience turned into kind of a circus. With a tab of over $353 dollars I can only recommend other travelers to consider maybe stoping in for the libations and skipping the food. The Market Citrus was clever but the taste was ‚ÄúOK‚Äù. I was excited for this experience and it felt like the establishment was dated. I will say maybe the restaurant had an ‚Äúoff‚Äù night but at that kind of money being spent no free passes can be given. The cocktail glasses were a preamble for all things that followed: they were covered in water spots and etched from repeated washing‚Äôs.  It‚Äôs disappointing so much money was spent and didn‚Äôt live up to expectations one expects.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We were the first ones in at 5:30p.  The wait staff was excellent, very attentive.  The restaurant seemed clean and has very good ambiance.  The 8oz filet mignon steaks should have been tasty.  By the way they were served, I suspect they had been per-seared on the grill, set aside awaiting the first orders, then warmed up.  They certainly weren't sizzling and hot off the grill.  Neither were the baked potatoes, barely melted the butter.  And $25 for a Tito's & Tonic, I'll drink elsewhere.  Too many choices in LV for this.",Bad,Good,Good
I did not think that the service or the food was that great considering over $500 price tag. You can have  better tasting food somewhere else for $100 bill. Also I did not think our server focused on our table although we ordered the most expensive steaks in their menu. I would not go to this establishment again. There are way better alternatives in Vegas!!,Bad,,Bad
"Excellent tomahawk and fillet‚Ä¶.get the battered fried mushrooms! The bread, the salads, all really terrific.",Good,,
"What a huge let down. The food was mediocre at best and the service was poor.


I would try just about any alternative unless you are looking to be disappointed.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This was our 33rd wedding anniversary and this restaurant was just so disappointing. 


My wife ordered the Filet and Brussel Sprouts. I ordered the Rib Eye and Baked Potato. (They hadn‚Äôt brought bread until dinner was half complete). 


My wife began cutting her filet. The filet was literally cold and the rib eye was cool. The brussel sprouts were cool as well. The waiter seemed annoyed when we called him over. They returned all the food and literally just heated it up cut up pieces and all were returned. They couldn‚Äôt bother to cook a fresh steak. The potato was now cold. The rib eye was extremely fatty and I left about 6oz of fat on the plate. 


I called the manager over (while my steak was being reheated.) to speak to him and all he said was oh I‚Äôm sorry and played stupid. He sees my potato sitting. When the steaks arrived back and the filet was in pieces I asked the manager if this was standard in a high end steak house because it was classless. He again said oh I‚Äôm sorry. So casually and again played stupid. Didn‚Äôt even offer to prepare a fresh steak or bring me a hot potato. 


The dinner was on Oct 15,2021. Only manager on duty. The meal was $283 with starters and 1 glass a wine for my wife. I spoke to the manager on the way out and expressed my disappointment. He said again....I‚Äôm sorry. Like he was trained to act stupid. I felt like I was telling him how to do his job. I said you didn‚Äôt even offer to bring me a fresh potato, a piece of cake let alone how classes it was to bring out cut up steak on a plate. Again he could care less. 


I‚Äôm a regular hotel guest. 3-4 times a year and amazed at this because the hotel is outstanding.",Bad,,Bad
"I was thrilled when I saw Hudson Valley fois gras on the menu. Fois gras is something Californians can‚Äôt legally get a hold of. I ordered that as my appetizer. I was in heaven. I also ordered Chilean sea bass with a Maitake mushroom. Delicious! That mushroom was surprisingly tasty. The American Wagyu steak was tender. We also ordered the Crunchy potatoes. Don‚Äôt get filled up on the bread even though it‚Äôs so hot, fresh and good! Everything was perfection.",Good,,
Literally the worst steak I had. 18oz bone in rib-eye was dry AF and no flavor. Sides were terrible. Service was slow. Lobster was over cooked! The only good thing was the bread and butter. Bardot‚Äôs had a better steak!,Bad,,Bad
"My husband and I attended Jean Georges with another couple for a remarkable dinner.  For appetizers, we were presented with a seafood board that included  lobster tail, king crab leg, oysters, clams, shrimp &scallops.  We also had the bacon wrapped shrimp which was the best ever!  For an entree I had the Filet Mignon 8oz, and my husband had the New York Strip 14 oz, with Yukon Gold mashed potatoes that were so very creamy.  The asparagus was absolutely delicious as well.  The desert board presentation was lovely also, with a hollow white chocolate ball that was doused with hot chocolate sauce that broke it when poured over, cheesecake and a few other sweeties.  Stunning!  Would definitely go back.",Good,,
"Wow. Every aspect of my daughter‚Äôs birthday dinner was priceless. The waitstaff was attentive, knowledgeable and most pleasant. Eight of us were treated as if we were the only ones in the restaurant. The food was well prepared, temperatures were perfect and the variety of dishes we ordered‚Ä¶.each was divine. Absolutely happy with our experience and so glad we chose Jean Georges. 
I chose the sea bass and was not disappointed.",Good,Good,Good
"Arrived on time for our 6:45 reservation.  Despite the restaurant being maybe 20% full, we were promptly seated at a table right next to the waitress station, in the back of the restaurant next to a table of 8, right on the walkway through the restaurant.  I will say our 2 servers were excellent; attentive without being intrusive, friendly and funny.  The bread was incredible. Ceasar salad was average, summer corn soup was very one-note and didn‚Äôt deliver much in the way of corn flavor despite it being peak season.  Both the filet and rib cap were very good and cooked as requested.  The creamed corn side dish was good, if not great.  We ordered a salt baked potato to share. It was thoughtfully presented already cut in half for each of us and served with our own set up of butter, sour cream and chives. Unfortunately the baked potato was nowhere near cooked!  It was barely warm to the touch and hard as a rock.  Our waiter apologized and offered to get us a new, cooked, potato, but we asked for the Yukon mashed potatoes instead, which were delivered quickly and very tasty.  We were never visited by a manager or host about the raw baked potato.  We were still charged for said raw potato as well.  I visit Las Vegas very frequently and had been looking forward to trying Jean Georges.  Chef Vongerichten has an excellent reputation and I had hoped for an elevated steakhouse experience, but this was quite disappointing.",Bad,Bad,Good
"I normally don't think much about restaurants from hotels but it wasn't too bad. It takes a long time to get in because the place has a rep as one of the better steak houses, so I knew to expect the kinds of prices I saw for the steak cuts, and quite honestly, they are over priced. I can't say the food was bad, it was OK, really, but it did  not blow me away- maybe I was too fixated on the price to think there was not a match. The black truffle Mac and Cheese was fantastic though. Great service and really cool interior design though.",Bad,Good,Good
"We ate at Jean George Steakhouse in Aria.  It was on a Sunday and the restaurant was crowded.  We were seated promptly at 5:30 pm,  We split the Strawberry Salad and shared asparagus and shared the 32oz porterhouse steak and had the market citrus dessert along with two cocktails a piece.  Over, the meal and steak were very enjoyable/",Good,,
"While the service and atmosphere were both excellent, the food was mostly average and overpriced even for Las Vegas.  Seafood platters were a big hit with enough for everyone!  Sea bass was liked as were about 50% of the strip steaks. However, the Bone In Ribeye was subpar. Not only were our steaks mostly fat, they were chewy,  tasteless and not even close to 18oz. At $77 we expected to be blown away.  Sides were a hit and miss too and were extremely small-especially for a so called steakhouse. Too bad because the service was exemplary!  With so many better options in Las Vegas, this is not a place I would recommend.",Bad,Good,Good
"We had steak and crab legs on a Saturday night, and everything was very good. I have eaten at several steak houses in Las Vegas and this ranks right among the best. I would eat there again when we stay at the Aria.",Good,,
Service was slow.  Ok.  I ordered an ‚ÄòAmerican Wagyu‚Äô steak.  I have had Wagyu.   This wasn‚Äôt it.   I would say it was chuck eye from my experience.  Manager said he would ‚Äòtake care of it‚Äô but did nothing.   There are too many good steakhouses in Vegas to waste your hard working money here.,,Bad,Bad
"The worst customer experience we‚Äôve ever had.


Waitress
Our waitress was not very attentive with our dining experience. She was not very responsive or present with our questions, food or what we‚Äôre there to celebrate for; it was my husband‚Äôs birthday. Her demeanor was off-putting and unprofessional (for us to overhear her speaking unkindly about another customer/guest). She did not ask how the food is, if we would like anything and did not offer desert or coffee after our dinner.


Manager #1 - Jacob Kauffman
Sunday, 07/11/2021
After being extremely disappointment with my dining experience, I contacted the restaurant manager via telephone Sunday, 07/11/2021. I explained how displeased and unsatisfied my husband and I were with our waitress. I received an informal email from Jacob explaining how he needs to ‚Äúresearch‚Äù about my issue. Jacob never called or emailed again.


Manager #2 ‚Äì Jerry
Wednesday, 07/14/2021
Now my husband and I are livid by this whole restaurant and company. For an upscale fine dining restaurant, this type of treatment is absolutely unacceptable and beyond disrespectful to the customer. Instead of Jacob or another team member reaching out to me out of courtesy, I contacted Jerry on Wednesday, 07/14/2021. I explained once again and shared new information of how extremely disappointed we are with our overall service from the waitress and now Jacob. I did not appreciate Jerry‚Äôs suggestive remarks of how I should have handled my concerns/issues with the waitress; he implied I should have voiced my concerns the day of reservation. My husband‚Äôs birthday celebration is my priority. Video surveillance will show as proof/evidence how inattentive our waitress was so I advised Jerry to search through their records. Jerry asked what outcome I would like, and I requested more than half my money back.


Tuesday, 07/20/2021
After 9 days of ‚Äúresearching‚Äù I once again received an informal form of communication via email of my $100.00 refund. Nowhere in my email does it state we were unable to accommodate more than half of your refund request or given me an option of how I would like my refund as I split the cost between two credit cards. Jacob and Jerry are very unprofessional. My husband and I were ignored. Both managers did not have the common courtesy to contact us over the phone and provide us with a status or say a simple thank you for your patience as it‚Äôs taking longer than expected. 


Corporate Office
Sunday, 07/18/201 @12:06pm  voicemail 
Tuesday, 07/20/2021 @7:41am  Lina  x1900 Executive Assistant 
I refused to speak to anyone from this restaurant and preferred to escalate the issue. I left a voicemail to the corporate office Sunday, 07/18/201 at 12:06pm, no one called me back. On Tuesday, 07/20/2021 @7:41am, I got a hold of an executive assistant. Although Lina works for a different department, she took my call. I explained what happened, but just like Jacob and Jerry, her condescending attitude came out. She became very rude and patronizing.


Bottom Line
We had a very poor experience for a special occasion. We hoped to rectify the Bad by reporting it to management. We were ignored on two separate experiences. We only received a quarter of our money back. This is a problem on a company level; from the restaurant to corporate. We will NEVER go back to this restaurant and we hope you do the same.

"Solid steak - among the best preparations of Waygu post pandemic. Not overly seasoned just juicy natural flavors. Delicious free bread. Fun sauces for the meat. Wife enjoyed the halibut. But as we all know, the sides complete the meal. The spinach was just ok, mushrooms definitely better.  Steak is a 4.5/5, sides a 3.5/5. 
Our server Rachel was friendly and knowledgeable - 5/5. The service and bread made up the extra half star. The manager even dropped by to check on us. 
Pro tip: if you‚Äôre a solo drinker the Pine Ridge Cab by the glass is nice, the Frank Family is a good option by the bottle.",Good,,Good
"Got there around 5:30 p.m. and asked if takeout was available. To my surprise, it was. Ordered a NY Strip ($67) and baked potato ($17) from the bar. Very nice layout and atmosphere. There was not a lot of people inside but I felt more comfortable eating in my room. The steak was good. Not the best steak I ever had but I was satisfied. The bread and butter that came with it was the scene-stealer IMO. They also included what looked like samples of four different steak sauces but I like my steak plain. If I stay at Aria again I would visit but I wouldn't go out of my way to return.",Good,Good,
"There were three in our party with a reservation for 8 pm on Tuesday 6-15, after multiple e mails and texts telling us to be on time etc, we arrived precisely at 8 pm. We were told the table was not ready, really, why didn‚Äôt they text us with that information.
It was 8:20 before we were seated.
They seemed short staffed, before the server greeted us about 20 minutes elapsed. In that time we were given water, picked out a wine [the sommelier was excellent] and were served delicious salted Parker house rolls and butter, still no server.
We were given menus and ordered. All the food was 5 star for quality, presentation and deliciousness. I had the spring vegetable side dish as my appt.; the super fresh vegetables of haricots vert, fresh peas and sugar snaps were the star of the 1st course, we almost ordered another.
Then something odd happened, time went by and, although we were in no hurry, saw tables that came after us get their food and finish. After 45 minutes I asked the server asst., to check on our entrees.  A few minutes later our server appeared, the kitchen had lost the ticket and were rushing the order. Why didn‚Äôt the server notice?
He insisted on showing our table that the order had been put by him on time, so it was the kitchen‚Äôs error.
Finally we received the entrees but over 1 hour had elapsed. They were excellent, my Short Ribs the best I‚Äôve ever had.
There were 2 floor managers in suits walking the dining room, I found it odd that neither approached the table to offer an apology or explain. We didn‚Äôt want a Comp just a pleasant apology.
Maybe they are there to look official, and they do, but to actually approach a guest?, we‚Äôll, that‚Äôs above their pay grade.",Good,Bad,Bad
"My wife and I had high hopes for this restaurant; especially after watching some of the more popular Vegas VLOG‚Äôers giving positive reviews.   I can‚Äôt say my review will fall in line with their.  However, I do have some positive comments to share as well.  The restaurant is located inside the Aria, Las Vegas casino resort.  As such, all the upscale dining establishments should also live up to the service and quality one comes to expect by the Aria brand. 


From a food quality perspective, Jean Georges shines‚Ä¶.sort of.  We had the chilled seafood platter as an appetizer.  The stand the plate rests on is too tall and makes seeing inside the bowl a little difficult.  It‚Äôs was not so much a major concern as it was an annoyance.  Both the oysters and the mussels were small, subpar.  The lobster was good, sweet and tender as was the crab leg.  We had the chilled seafood platter, the at Mina‚Äôs within the Bellagio the night prior and it far surpassed the quality of Jean Georges.  The lobster tail, F1 Filet Mignon, blue cheese mashed potatoes were excellent.  Two thumbs up. 


So what was the problem?  First, the atmosphere was lacking character, was cold and the seating consisted of mostly a very long bench seat with tables pulled up to it.  It lacks the ‚Äútraditional steakhouse feel‚Äù.  Second, service was substandard for the price point of the restaurant.  Had the prices been at least 50% lower then the staff would have met the bill.  That said, for the money, the service was sub par at best‚Äî-along the lines of Texas Roadhouse or The Longhorn Steakhouse.  Our bill was approximately $840 when all was said and done.  A $1,000 dinner at Joel Robuchon was more of a value than $800 here.

"Incredibly disappointed!  This should in no way be classified as a high end steakhouse.  From service to grade of meat to preparation, they failed.  We were staying at Aria and celebrating Fathers Day and my husband‚Äôs birthday.  The server, Jonathan, was unfriendly and seemingly wanted to turn our table over as quickly as possible.  We ordered a filet mignon (medium rare) and a ribeye (medium) accompanied by asparagus.  The food arrived quickly accompanied by large steak knives.  I mention the knives because this is when we first realized that there was an issue with their product.  We both struggled to cut through our steaks.  Typically, you can use a butter knife to cut through a medium rare filet in a high end restaurant.  Both of us had chewy meat.  But even looking past the quality of meat, there was no flavor other than a taste of the char on the surface.  The asparagus was bitter and stringy.  We brought all of this to Jonathan‚Äôs attention, which seemed to make him angry (which made us very uncomfortable).   We each only ate a couple of bites and sat awkwardly in front of our plates for several minutes while we waited for the manager to come by.  It was clear by the number of issues with our meals that starting over was not going to produce better results.  They are just not up to the standard you would expect for the prices they charge.  We would have gotten much better steaks at Outback.  Since we did not wish to receive a replacement meal, the manager said that he would see what he could do.  We sat at our empty table for 30 minutes without any communication from anyone until a very nasty Jonathan came back and asked us for our name and room number.  He brought our check out for the full price of the food, less the cost of the asparagus and two soft drinks‚Ä¶$153.00!!!!  Jonathan even had the nerve to tell us that there‚Äôs nothing they can do if we won‚Äôt give them an opportunity to fix it.  We paid the bill and even left a tip for Jonathan and left having not eaten anything at all.  Absolutely Horrible.  They failed on every level.   In retrospect, I feel that I should have stood up for myself more, but they had already wasted so much of my evening and ruined my husband‚Äôs celebration.",Bad,Bad,Bad
My wife and I ate here on our trip. First time eating here and the service was amazing. As soon as we sat down we had servers helping us. It was like a movie that it was so on point. I had a NY strip and it was PERFECT!! Highly recommended,Good,Good,Good
First class but expensive. Had my sons wedding dinner there. Great steaks and outstanding service. The variety of food was great. The staffs attention to service and detail was outstanding.,Good,,Good
We ordered take out to our room at the Aria Sky Suites and Steak was so amazing melt in your mouth. We ordered the Market Citrus Dessert and OH my Lanta! It was sooo wonderful!! I wanted some to take home on the plane with me for my friends!,Good,,
"First, the negatives to get them out of the way.  We waited 15 minutes for our reserved table.  People who came in after us of the same party size were seated before us.  One of those couples had a lobby visit by an employee in a chef jacket. Hmmm.  Anyway, at a high end steakhouse, one shouldn‚Äôt be waiting for their table to be ‚Äú prepared‚Äù.  Our servers were OK, a little brusque.  We ordered shrimp cocktail to start and grilled octopus.  The octopus had little added flavor other than the wood grill taste.  Shrimp cocktail was not crisp, rather four pieces of limp fish on a plate.  The tenderloin was a bit over cooked and the king crab legs lacked flavor as well.  Wine list was seriously overpriced so we settled on cocktails.  Positives?   The mushrooms and asparagus sides were really good.  Would we return?  In Vegas, with so many choices?  No.",Good,,Bad
I ate dinner at this restaurant in  December 2020.  Food was fabulous.  The Service was top notch.  Highly recommend.,Good,,Good
"James made for another excellent meal!  We come now every trip even when not staying at Aria!


Seafood platter, short ribs, steak, desert cappuccino  wine drinks all great!",Good,,
"First time at a nice steakhouse in vegas and this place was a must try. We had the a5 japanese kobe beef 3 oz, the short rib, brussel sprouts and fries. The short rib takes 2 days to prepare and it was fantastic! My friend had the kobe and she said it was the best steak she has every had in her life, we were told they are 1 of 8 places in the country to have this kind of steak available. Brussels were good a little too much balsamic for me but still very good and the fries were excellent. The staff was so friendly and it was overall just a great experience.",Good,Good,Good
"My companion and I will be moaning over Jean Georges for weeks to come. First off, best service of the entire trip, they show a real appreciation for patrons during COVID. I had a raspberry lychee concoction that was absolutely perfect. Waitstaff were overly surprised by my companion who is in recovery and doesn't drink. My companion enjoyed the buttery buns they brought to the table. This was followed by the carpaccio appetizer which was melt in your mouth...okay more like softly explode.  The filet medium rare was to die for, perfectly cooked. We also had the brussels sprouts but the char was a bit much for our tastes. The grand finale was the chocolate cake. The presentation was amazing although I preferred the taste of the cheesecake, the chocolate cake was a hands down winner.",Good,,Good
"My wife and I were in Vegas for a wedding in October, decided to try your steakhouse, best decision we made!! Wagyu steak was my first, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint! And the sauces were excellent. Would recommend to anyone.",Good,,
This was our 3rd trip to Jean George and we've had the pleasure of being served by Joseph and James each time.  The recommendations they make are always excellent and they take outstanding care of us. This trip we were staying at Wynn and made the trip over to Jean George  and the outstanding service by Joseph and James is a big part of the reason why!,Good,,Good
"This was the greatest dining experience we've had. Food was amazing! Ribeye, Sea Bass, Shrimp App, Molten/Chz Cake Dessert were all delicious The service was nothing short of spectacular as we conversed with the service crew and management. Gerry and his team know hospitality, and it shows through your experience! Ask for him, he's great!",Good,Good,Good
"I was looking forward to this meal the most of all the ones I experienced in Vegas. Service was pretty good. We had a hard time hearing anything the servers were saying because of the masks and the size of the table. Cocktails were delicious. We started with a double shellfish platter and were pretty underwhelmed. The size of it was comparable to a regular tower at a restaurant like Morton‚Äôs or capital grill and their towers are superior to this one. The best appetizer by far was the beef carpaccio. We were blown away by the amount of flavor just one bite had. We also ordered the crispy sushi sampler and it was amazing. Really fresh and delicious. For dinner we ordered the rib cap, which is a very unique cut of meat that most Steakhouse‚Äôs don‚Äôt sell. It‚Äôs an american wagyu and was cooked perfectly with a side of shishito peppers. I didn‚Äôt try them but the looked good. We ordered the truffle Mac and cheese which was nice but it‚Äôs typical steakhouse Mac and cheese elevated by truffle. The crispy potatoes were great. A smashed baby potato that I‚Äôm guessing is fried after it‚Äôs been baked with a chili yogurt sauce. We also ordered two orders of bone marrow, not knowing that it was literally the whole bone and took up 3/4 of the table. It was, however, some of the best bone marrow I‚Äôd ever had. It was served with a delicious herb and lemon gremolata which accentuated every bite. I mean, it was amazing. For dessert we had the molten chocolate cake. We had to since Jean Georges was the pioneer of this dessert. It was incredible. Exactly the way it should be. Hot and melty and chocolatey. It‚Äôs a very rich meal so prepare yourself.",Good,Good,Good
"Worst restaurant in Vegas.
Went to Jean George for a business meal with 7 people. Made reservation for 8pm, when arrived there, they made me wait 1:30 hours for a table since we wanted to add 1 extra person. The appetizers were amazing mainly the tuna tartar. However, we all ordered steak, main dish on the house. It took another 1:30 for them to serve us the steak. I ordered medium well and it came well done, my colleagues ordered medium, it came rare and very bloody. The steaks were an awful experience. We literally had a 4hr dinner due to all these delays and service. I will never go back to this restaurant or recommend to other people.",Bad,Bad,Bad

He spent valentines evening on the floor of the bathroom. I believe it was the food. We will never go back. So disappointed .",Bad,Bad,Good
Had dinner in a private room and the staff were professional and all the food was as excellent as you would expect. I had an A5 steak for the first time and it was truly worth all the hype (be careful to not get one too big because it is so rich you may not be able to finish it). The seafood was perfect and the wine list had everything you could want or imagine.,Good,,Good
"We were staying at the Aria so we thought we would try this restaurant for a nice meal.  The food was tasty but the atmosphere was not good.  We were sitting facing out looking into the restaurant.  There were two stations that had a large tray and the dirty dishes would be put on it.  HOWEVER, they didn't take the dishes away, as they cleared dishes from tables they would just stack them up higher and higher until someone came and got it.  The whole night we were looking at 2 of these stations.  It seriously affected my evening.  Not was I was expecting from such a place.  the food was tasty but we didn't stay for dessert as I was done looking at dirty dishes.",Good,Bad,
"I wish I could offer a review on the food, but we didn't even make it to dinner. Stayed at the Aria Hotel for the first and last time this past weekend and made a reservation to dine at Jean George for Saturday night (I now realize why I was able to get a reservation so easily). Our friends arrived 20 minutes before our 8:00 reservation to have drink and were greeted with such poor and unprofessional service that by the time we arrived they actually wanted to go somewhere else to eat, which we proceeded to do. I did speak to the manager, to express my dissatisfaction and to let them know why we were leaving. The manager was certainly nice enough, however it more than evident that she lacked the experience to handle such a situation in a manner that would have been appropriate for this type of restaurant.  I have been to fine and not so fine restaurants all over the world, and this was the first time I left before dining because of service and/or rude behavior.  I consider myself a fairly experienced diner, and understand that restaurants and/servers can have ""off"" nights. However this was certainly not the case. Nor was there an issue of being understaffed or too busy, as the restaurant and bar was extremely quiet for a Saturday night. There are so many excellent restaurants with impeccable staff and service in Vegas that know how to treat customers, there is simply no reason to visit Jean Georges.",,Bad,Bad
Had a business dinner there and absolutely loved it. The tomahawk steak and seafood platter was excellent. Great place great service great food great drinks!!,Good,Good,Good
The ribcap was great and that‚Äôs it.  So I sat at the bar on a slow Monday night and ordered wine.  It took her about 15 min to pour a glass then she finally came and told me she‚Äôll pour extra for the long wait.  I ordered the dinner with the wine and waited.  The guy sitting next to me came about 20 later and he gets his steak and mine still didn‚Äôt come.  Finally my steak came but no fries.  I ate the steak and once done she brings the fries. She never asks about desert and gives me the bill. $120 later I leave and what a terrible experience.  No manager no nothing just bad bad!  Was so looking forward but so disappointed!!,Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had dinner there last week and really enjoyed it. The service was good and the food was wonderful. Though it is on the expensive side but it seems like most nice places in Vegas are.
Not sure about the girl that came and took our picture and tried to sell us super expensive prints, I thought that was weird and not something a fine restaurant should have.",Good,,Good
We had a great dining experience tonight at this restaurant. The Sea Bass was the best we‚Äôve ever had. Thank you Rachel and Juan for the best service!! We will definitely be back!,Good,Good,Good

"Recently celebrating a decade on Aria‚Äôs second floor, only it and The Buffet remaining since December 2009 while so much else has changed, it was at the site of last year‚Äôs best meal that a new decade got started, and once again Jean Georges Steakhouse lived up to high expectations.


Led by Chef Sean Griffin since 2015, including a renovation that upgraded d√©cor and delivery of unparalleled Meats and Produce, guests entering Jean Georges Steakhouse are greeted first at a podium before being led to spot-lit tables, the mood upscale but never stuffy while prices track similar to other similar Restaurants that feature far less creative cuisine.


Decorated in gold, and updating the menu at least seasonally, it was as a party of four that carte blanche was given to Chef Griffin, Wine and Cocktails quickly followed by buttery Loaves of Brioche and a sizable tower of Seafood highlighted by jumbo King Crab Legs and Oysters from both coasts that paired well with housemade Mignonette.


Playing background music that is never invasive throughout the four-course feast, it was alongside the Shellfish that Sean delivered his newest Amuse, Caviar and Lemon tucked inside dainty Spinach Pasta a bite of pure luxury while Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp and Foie Gras Br√ªl√©e each balanced sweetness with a bit of heat and a smooth finish.


Using Salad as a segue to grilled Meats, the iconic Hearts of Palm and Tomatoes praised by all for its brightness while a simple Caesar and briny ‚ÄúBeet Greek‚Äù also performed well, it was on a large central board the two full Bones of Marrow soon arrived with gently seared Scallops and F1 Wagyu, the hybrid buttery and rich which thus relegated Jean Georges quartet of Sauces irrelevant save for as a dip for Fries.


Specifically requesting the Wagyu Brisket carved tableside, each slice of Beef from Mishima Ranch smoky and moist even before adding an unforgettable spoonful of Sauce, no guest should leave Jean Georges without a taste of the city‚Äôs best Fried Chicken, and if in season also the truffled Tempura Squash.


Refreshing the palate between bites with Mushrooms and Sprouts, the latter a particularly praiseworthy preparation with all three ingredients in harmony, Dessert saw nothing but old favorites down the line, Chef Vongerichten‚Äôs Chocolate Cake served in its classic form and followed by Cheesecake, photo-friendly Citrus and faultless Apple Pie.


FIVE STARS:  As the site of 2019's best Las Vegas meal, Jean George Steakhouse seemed an ideal spot to take the first bites of 2020, and just as prior Sean Griffin's cooking continues to shine as a result of Ingredient sourcing and skill with no signs of slowing in terms of quality or creativity.",Good,Good,
I reviewed this steak house after my last trip and mentioned that I would try it one more time to report back. I have to say there is a steady decline in the quality of service and food. I would not pay the price they asking for in this place for standard beef. It is common on the experience you get in all of Aria though. They want  you to pay luxury prices and offer you a standard experience.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"A family gathering ended with a dinner at this restaurant to celebrate my birthday. Beautiful ambiance and very friendly staff. After looking at the menu and all of the beef options, it is a steakhouse you know, I decided to try the porcini crusted salmon. Oh my gosh! We live in the Pacific Northwest so we know about fresh fish. This was by far the best piece of salmon I have ever had and the porcini crust was to die for. Numerous people in our group, 10 of us, had various beef cuts and the responses were all amazing. Incredible wine list and an amazing tray of ‚Äúbirthday‚Äù desserts came our way. It was a beautiful family filled evening. You will not be disappointed.",Good,Good,Good
"Jean Georges isn't simply a restaurant. It's an experience--as well it should be, considering the cost! This was certainly the most expensive date of our lives, but the service and food were absolute perfection. 


We had reservations for right as the restaurant opened at 5:30 and waited out in the lobby. An attendant knew we had been waiting and came out to escort us to our table. We met our waiter immediately. When we ordered, he offered helpful advice on wine pairings and menu items, and consulted us on the order we would like the food.


I won't waste the space offering individual superlatives for each amazing dish, but the star of the show--the reason we were there--was the A5 Kobe sirloin. My word. Three-ounces of divine indulgence, right there. Our other delights included the bacon-wrapped shrimp, 18-ounce ribeye for my husband, my porcini-crusted salmon, shared sides of truffle macaroni and cheese as well as Brussels sprouts, and to finish off the meal, a Jean-Georges gold brick.


Incredible. Just incredible. I am sure it will be years before I have another such lavish meal.",Good,Good,Good
Went there for a birthday dinner and food was decent however service was terrible. It seemed like once we didn‚Äôt order cocktails our waiter decided our 250$ check wasn‚Äôt going to be expensive enough for a decent tip and didn‚Äôt come back to the table till after we paid our check. By far the worst service I have ever had at a high end steak house.,,,Bad

"We went here for anniversary dinner on a recent trip and I can‚Äôt think of a more disappointing expensive dinner. I‚Äôll start with the pros.


Pros: 
1. We were greeted by the hostess and congratulate on our anniversary.
2. The staff was friendly and served us an anniversary dessert. 


Cons:
1) I ordered a bourbon on the rocks. When asked what type, I stated a single cube. That was a $4 up charge. Seems like something the wait staff would let you know. 


2) My wife ordered the prime filet medium well and I ordered the bone-in ribeye medium rare. 
a) First, if you have any modicum of cooking knowledge regarding steaks, just save your money and never order one at a restaurant like this. You‚Äôll spend triple or quadruple what you can buy for two from your local butcher and create a more flavorful steak. 
b) My wife‚Äôs steak came back well done and very much tasted like hamburger. This is supposed to be a prime cut of meat, and it was bland, dry and outright a waste of what is a good cut of meat. My steak was also a prime cut of beef. Aside from being served medium well (I wanted medium rare) the steak also lacked flavor. I‚Äôm I spent $150 on two steaks that had no flavor, and were not cooked right; I suppose I‚Äôm the dummy.


3) They brought out 5 sauces to go along with the steaks. I thought this a bit odd at first, but soon realized that the sauces were there to hide the blandness of the steak. If a steak is seasoned right you won‚Äôt need any type of special sauce. 


4) We were served some type of bread to begin our meal. It wasn‚Äôt that good, and you‚Äôd probably enjoy the bread at Outback (yes, Outback) more than what you get here. 


5) Lastly, and the most hilarious, the mac and cheese side dish cost $17 and has to have the highest profit margin in all of Vegas. The dish was probably 4 oz. worth of food. But the real kicker is that it looked like the mac and cheese you get a Chick-fil-A, however, Chick-fil-A‚Äôs would win a contest every time over Jean George‚Äôs. A description of it is a cheese crust topping followed by a white cheese version of Velveeta Mac and cheese, yet, I‚Äôd be inclined to say that Velveeta makes a better box mac and cheese. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the chefs (side eyes followed by eye roll) used some box mac and cheese and just broiled it to get a cheese crust topping. 


Overall, Jean George‚Äôs is overrated crap. The fact they charge the prices they do for what the serve is a stunning testament to people not taking criticism seriously.",Bad,Bad,Good
"On our first night in Vegas and we wanted a great steak for dinner and we decided to go to Jean George Steakhouse in the Aria Hotel.  The restaurant was great and the food was amazing!  I had a medium rare filet and our group shared multiple side dishes.  I was very impressed with the quality of the food, wine and service.  The food was a bit pricey but I am a firm believer that you get what you pay for and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who would like to experience a top tier steakhouse.",Good,Good,Good
"The food was OK, the service also but nothing to justify the astonomical price of the food.


Nothing in that restaurant is impressive except the price",Bad,,
"Fantastic food, exceptional wine list, patient wait staff. Went with a large group after a few had a couple too many drinks. This is a fine dining experience to say the least. The staff were what set this restaurant apart. They were patient and gracious throughout our meal. They were receptive to all our requests. The truffle mac&cheese was delicious. The bread was the best in Vegas. Note: all the portions are large! My husband and I split several items.",Good,,Good
"This is a good little steak house, The food was good and the evening suitable with a business associate.The steak house wants to be a higher category than it actually is with the actual sitting. It is not a sit down top end meal, though the food is excellent.",Good,Good,
"My wife and I went to Jean Georges Steakhouse to celebrate my birthday, and to continue my quest to dine at all of the fine dining steakhouses on the Strip.  Jean Georges is at the top of my list for quality food and impeccable service.  Jack and James, our servers, made us feel right at home.  The menu offers unique items and outstanding meat.  We decided to share the Wagyu carpaccio for an appetizer.  The flavor of the meat combined beautifully with the black truffle fritters and lime salt--truly delectable.  My wife had the Chilean sea bass with a beautiful maitake mushroom on the side.  Again, great flavors in the miso-yuzu glaze on the fish and the succulence of the mushroom.  I had the Wagyu ribeye cap--such a beautiful piece of  steak, perfectly cooked.  My complimentary birthday treat was a chocolate shell with chocolate-covered coffee beans ""sealed"" inside.  A tap of a spoon on the shell released the delicious beans--fun and beautiful.  All in all, this was a memorable birthday dinner.  By the way, small touches make a difference:  we opted for individual glasses of wine.  Our servers came with the two bottles and poured the requisite tastes for approval before pouring the glasses.  As Jack said, that's the way it should be.",Good,Good,Good
"EVERYTHING about this place is amazing. The Steak, drinks, dessert, bread, butter EVERYTHING!!! JUST GO!!",Good,,
"The filet was amazing. The sushi was pretty good. The drinks were amazing. The server was non-attentive.
very weird in such an amazing atmosphere. Price was as expected",Good,Good,Bad
The food was outstanding. Steaks were unbelievable!!  Service was fantastic as well!! They couldn't do enough for you. Dress code apparently doesn't matter.   We were dressed in sport coats  surrounded by flip flops and shorts.,Good,,Good
The food was fantastic and we felt completely taken care of by the staff. Would recommend to everyone-,Good,,Good
"Had dinner there this past week and one thing is clear...they are going to try to upsell you and run up large checks.


We knew going in that it was going to be expensive and considered heavy apps and splitting an entree...after hearing our waiter push the most expensive things on the menu and a visit from the sommelier within minutes of sitting down- we knew that would be frowned upon.


I came for the brisket and it did not dissapoint. Can't say it was worth the $100, as it was the single most expensive piece of meat I've ever bought, but it was damn good. If you got an appetizer, it could easily be split amoungst two people. The waiter was clearly interested in us ordering every course and wine pairing and when he saw we weren't- he spent most of his time courting other guests, which was fine with us. Guy was pretty arrogant and full of himself in my opinion.


My wife got a filet as we split our entrees and honestly it was disappointing. Overcooked and really didn't have much taste. I've had better at many a places. We had the corn as a side dish and it was very good. Job well done there.


Overall- it was an experience I was happpy doing once. I wouldn't go back due to the sheer cost of eating here. There are many other steak house that are 30% cheaper that would be as good or better for steaks and sides. Couldn't get the brisket though- so it was worth doing once.",Bad,Good,Bad
The best NY Strit in town for me. Also the bread and the saladas were amazing. They have a very good wine list.,Good,,
"im not one of this people that like to talk bad stuff about restaurants but i do feel i have to warn people from eating in this resturant. for my opinion its overpriced, Good, and horrible service i have ever exprined on the strip.",Bad,,Bad
"I brought a  some clients  for a dinner to Jean George Steak house after the packaging show. Been here is the past and just as good as always . All of us had a different dinner meal so we all shared some .  With out looking at the menu we told the waiter what we where looking for a dinner . He went back to the chef and the chef said he would make are requests . This is a real steak house .One of us had a fish plate prepared perfect in an ice plate . 


the meal was equal to the other steak hoses in Vegas for cost  but worth the it . so try a Vegas steak house",Good,,
"Great ambiance to enjoy a top notch dinner and service. 


Unfortunately, the food was average at best. Service was good, although subtle up-sale was evident throughout. 


In this case the food was sub-par for the pricing. $100 a person, without alcohol, is expecting above average food, which they do not deliver. 


Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the food was average, not bad. It‚Äôs like when you order a bottle of wine, you pay top dollar, the wine is EXPECTED to be great. When you pay low dollar, average is acceptable.",Bad,Good,Good
We went with a group for dinner and we thought the d√©cor was very nice and the service was fine. The steak quality for the Colorado filet was ok and was at $67 . The sides were also quite good and tasty. The only issue was that the waiter kept trying to upsell us to a much more expensive steak. He was insistent that it was worth it. The group thought was that their steaks were fine but mine was a little tough for median rare. You might want to check out other locations for comparison pricing.,Good,Good,Good
"Extremely expensive check, yet very very dissapointing food and stake. Don't get me wrong, I am a regular of Michelin star places, but only if it is worthed. This one was a Big rip off. Please stay away. There are other great stake rest's in LV with much much reasonable prices. Shame on a ""celeb chef"":((((",Bad,,
"Came here to satisfy my steak craving and was not disappointed. The Bone in prime ribeye was exceptional. Perfectly Cooked and seasoned. The flavors were just outstanding (especially the ribeye cap). Paired this with the Caeser salad and black truffle Mac and cheese. Both were fantastic. Reasonable prices were an added bonus! They are one of the few certified A5 Kobe beef restaurants, and I will be trying that on the next trip!",Good,,
"This is our first stop for dinner on every visit to Vegas. We have eaten here so many times I have lost count. The sea bass and filet were outstanding as usual. Thanks for another great experience, and please bring back the pretzel bread.  :)",Good,Good,
"We had a large group dinner in one of the private rooms on a week day. One point of note, the restaurant was not at full capacity and our dinner was scheduled for 7:15pm but did not get started until 7:40pm. Somewhere in the ‚Äúcontract‚Äù there was a clause in VERY small print which stated the restaurant would charge $500 for very extra 1/2 hour the room was used. At no time did the Aria restaurant concierge call this out nor did the account receivable team. We spent thousands of dollars for a dinner including Appetizers, main meal, desserts and refreshments but was penalized for going over the two hour allotment. The room was not being used after our party and we left before 10pm so the wait staff was not on overtime. Rushing the guests was not an option. Despite the food and service being terrific, I couldn‚Äôt recommend the establishment for private parties. Too much exposure for unnecessary usage fees.",Good,Bad,Good
"Meh - I've experienced better sums up our experience.  Like most patrons, I did extensive research to select a steakhouse to celebrate our tenth anniversary.  We were staying at Sky Suites so Jean Georges was an easy selection.


The ambience is dark and adds to the experience.  We were promptly seated for our 6:30pm reservation fulfilled by the Aria concierge.  The concierge did note our anniversary celebration on our reservation, but there was no mention of it by the restaurant team.


The menu was straight forward and we selected a shrimp cocktail to start, followed by filet's for the main course coupled with asparagus and baked potato for sides.  We added the scallop accompaniment (3 for $36) topped off with two rounds of dirty martini's (delicious).  $400 out the door.


We left underwhelmed and disappointed.  The service was on par with Outback as was the food.  Seriously, our filets were bland, lacked any resemblance of flavor and were ""plopped"" on our plates.  The sauces were interesting, but I elected for garlic butter which the staff whipped up for me.  We were served bread and butter 30 seconds after our entrees were delivered while the surrounding tables were provided their bread and butter upon arriving for dinner.  Not once did the servers every ask how our food was.  It's implied that the food is wonderful and if it's not prepared correctly or not to your liking, it doesn't really matter.


I really want to like this restaurant, but if the A1 or A5 beef is anything like our filet, I'm thrilled we didn't drop $400 on a 6oz A5 filet.


In closing, avoid this establishment if you would like to experience a memorable steak.  There are far too many strip steak houses that are much less expensive with far better steaks with servers who care about you and your dining experience.


P.S. - For everyone wondering about specifics on the dress code, I rocked dress shorts and a polo and nobody batted an eye.  I'm on vacation and if my super comfy shorts offend anyone, there are larger issues at play.  This was a hot topic of discussion I encountered when researching this restaurant, so thought I would add my .02.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We enjoyed a wonderful meal here in January 2019 and we loved it so much we decided to go back on our June trip. However, the food and service was not to the quality of the first trip. Not sure if it was new car smell or what but we were not as impressed with the steak. On the first trip I ranked this as top 5 steaks I have had, on the second trip it dropped to top 10. We will try a 3rd time to see if in consistency is a common issue for them.",Bad,,Bad
"We are definitely foodies so based on the reviews and the recommendation of a friend we thought this would be a great place to try..... I will say when the bill came I was shocked. 
When we go out for a dinner we don‚Äôt look at prices we order what sounds appealing and go with it. For $544 I would say this meal wasn‚Äôt worth it. The food was good don‚Äôt get me wrong it just wasn‚Äôt worth the price I‚Äôve had better for less. The desert was subpar. The scallops were soft and cooked perfectly. The steak was cooked perfectly. It just wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúthat‚Äù great. There‚Äôs many other restaurants in Vegas that serve better for less.",Bad,,
The restaurant is really really nice. I love the feel you get when you walk in. The staff is very friendly and courteous. I love the fact that you have someone coming to your table to fill you glass with water every single time your glass is empty. I know most restaurant well all restaurants do this I believe it‚Äôs the way they did it. You would have to be there to understand lol. The food was great. I had their lamb chops (delicious) and Caesar salad my husband had a steak and wedge salad we ate it ALL. They even gave me a complimentary dessert for my birthday!,Good,Good,Good
"I've returned to Jean Georges on every trip to the Aria. The service is always fantastic and the food is utterly amazing. I'm particularly a fan of the prime filet they serve (they also have a grass-fed that isn't as good in my opinion). I've never brought myself to get the wagyu here - though I've had it elsewhere. I suspect like everything else, it's fantastic. 


I really can't say enough positive things about Jean Georges. I highly recommend it. I also recommend making sure you get a reservation. It is very much an in-demand sort of place.",Good,Good,Good
"My wife and I were treated royally by the entire staff at your restaurant.  Our waiter Joseph, was just so cordial and knowledgeable.  He made us feel so comfortable, and he really helped us with our selections. 
The food was exceptional, and most importantly we had a great time from the moment we walked in.
We can't wait to go back soon!!",Good,Good,Good
This steakhouse was a little hard to find. It‚Äôs up a back escalator in the Aria.  The interior was really nice.  The service was top notch.  I had pork ribs app and the rib cap steak.  They are amazing.  The bread was also great.  A top notch place to eat.,Good,Good,Good
We have been to Jean Georges Prime in the Bellagio so expected Good from him at the Aria Hotel and were not disappointed. Both of us had the tasting menu that was a feast for the eyes as well as our stomachs. The wait staff was attentive and helpful. The osetra caviar served in a half of a lemon filled with a Meyer lemon gelee was fabulous. We would not hesitate to go again.,Good,,Good
"We are always excited to visit a new steakhouse (to us) whenever we are in Vegas, and reading many reviews led us to try Jean Georges this visit. Unfortunately the amazing food was overshadowed by the terrible service and eye popping prices. The (4 count) shrimp cocktail and tuna tartare were ok, I've had better tasting tuna tartare in much less expensive restaurants. The F1 filet was amazing, but looked so tiny on a huge plate with nothing else on it, and our side of lobster mashed potatoes were also very good. We finished with the dessert that looked like a gold bar - the most amazing dessert I've ever tasted. Now for the service (3 wait staff). We were an afterthought for all 3 servers. We never knew who or what would be coming to the table next, no mention of ""your steaks will be right out"", not much conversation from the wait staff at all. Our table was not cleaned of crumbs until after dessert, when it should have been swept after each course. Our coffee was brought to the table with no sugar or sweetener. We had to flag somone down for a packet of Splenda. The  ultimate insult was the bill - close to $500 for dinner for 2 - no alcohol and a shared dessert.   We felt like they couldn't wait for us to leave. So disappointing.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We celebrated with family and were completely happy with our choice.  We each chose a different entr√©e... Short Ribs, Sea Bass, Grass-Fed Filet and Wagyu Ribeye Cap.  ALL were excellent!  Attentive service and a nice ambiance topped off with a much-appreciated complementary dessert assortment.  Highly recommend!",Good,Good,Good
"Visited while staying at the Aria. With the extremely high cost of the food, the expectation goes up as well. While the steak and food was very good, not sure I would have been able to taste a difference if I had a steak from the Outback across the street. Service was excellent. Amount of food was average. Probably would not visit again simply due to the cost of the meal.",Bad,,Good
"Two of us for dinner, both of our steaks were over cooked. After complaining, they brought a third complimentary steak, which was also over cooked - not great. Wine list is good at the high end, but not enough mid-range choice. 


There are better steak places in Vegas than this.",Bad,,
We celebrated our anniveraay bu having dinner here and it was average while the prices weren't. The NY strip was ok but lacked flavour which was made up for by a trio of sauces provided. The service was also average. We have dined at Jwan George's in our home town of New York and had every different experience. Both the service and food at tere was outstanding.,Good,,Good
"We had an amazing evening in this restaurant, the staff were superb in assisting us in picking wine and explaining details on the menu. 
The food was fantastic and my steak was cooked perfectly. 
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for that extra special evening.",Good,Good,Good
"Been looking forward to this for months but it was a decidedly average experience which left a sour note given the price point.


Table wasn‚Äôt ready when we arrived, not the end of the world. Great decor, a modern take on a traditional steak house. 


Our main was brought out before we had our starter, was told it was on its way, didn‚Äôt appear, so we had to ask for the main to be taken away. Then waited 20 mins for our starter to arrive! 


Mains appears ( new dishes so that was good) but my better half steak was too charge-grilled and over done. My NY was very good. 


It wasn‚Äôt bad, but not special enough for the price. can think of four steak houses in our home town (Vancouver) which have always been better and cheaper.",Bad,Good,Bad
"The summary sums it up. If I wasn't on an expense report, there is no way I would have paid these prices. That said, the food was indeed great. But no beget than a typical morton's or capital Grille, and the service was more Vega cheesy with a somallier and server who feel the need to spend too much time talking when at your table, and not enough time coming back to check on you.",Good,Bad,Bad
It was very dark in here and the tables were so far apart (facing each other). I felt like I had to shout. We were excited to eat here. The steak was nice but not a good piece of fillet. The cocktails were too strong/not enough choice. I was basically drinking straight gin... the sides were nice especially the asparagus and mushrooms.,Good,Bad,
Got to try Jean George‚Äôs first to recommendation from family members so glad we took the advice. We arrived early so sat at the bar for cocktail and HELLO popcorn was served and it was amazing. The atmosphere and vibe was so nice and the staff was so friendly! We had group five so we all tried each other‚Äôs food and amazing. Appetizer had sushi plate please get perfect little bites before your amazing steak! The sides alone worth going back for! Overall great experience and great food.,Good,Good,Good
"Have tried other steakhouses on the strip, we find Jean Georges to be our favorite. As non drinkers we asked our server to recommend a dinner beverage for us. She recommended a virgin Mojito which was a perfect choice to enhance a perfect meal. The ambiance, the service and meal were without parallel. We will certainly be dining at Jean Georges again.",Good,Good,Good
"Staff was on it. ambiance is excellent and the food is great but not over the top. the desserts are awesome,",Good,Good,Good
"This is the second time we‚Äôve had dinner here. My husband had a steak and he had no complaints. My husband likes his steak well done and he ordered the Filet Mignon. The steak was cooked perfectly. My daughter and I had seafood which was just as wonderful. Very very attentive service. Dinner is pricey ,approx $250 w/no alcohol for 3. The food alone not worth the price but the entire experience was.",Bad,Good,Good
Always a delicious and decadent dinner.  Love the sea bass and short ribs. Great Moscow miles and very cozy for romantic dinner. Highly recommend!,Good,Good,
"We have stayed at the Aria many times and never made it to Jean Georges, we were looking forward to giving this place a try! We were seated promptly at our reservation time.  The place was super busy- busy with customers and busy with servers running around everywhere- but our server (I wish I could remember his name, but I can't) was outstanding- for several reasons--read on.


My husband and I had been up since 4:00am, traveled, and eating dinner at 10:30pm our time.  We were absolutely exhausted to say the least.  We enjoyed the bread basket and a bottle of Micah while we waited on our entrees; Salmon and Filet, with a baked potato and asparagus. 


Our server recommended the wine- phenomenal choice and was so memorable we remembered the name (Always a good sign.)  My husband had a piece of cork in his wine glass- he never said anything because we just are not those type of people- but our server noticed it and took care of it immediately! 


Both the entrees and sides were great- its unfortunate we were both so tired we didn't finish it all. 


When I went to stand up from the bench I was seated at I felt an unpleasant feeling of wetness and stickiness on my calf.  Someone sitting in the spot prior to me had stuck gum to the bench, and it was half stuck on my calf and half stuck on the bench in a stringy, sticky mess. I was a little in shock and a little mortified.  My husband sat back down and we waited for our server to come back by.  After I told him what happened he took immediate action; we apologized up and down, got me a warm cloth, and brought me alcohol and a towel and the warm cloth wasn't doing the job.  He apologized more times than I could count, which I appreciated even though there was nothing he did wrong.


As my husband and I walked out of the restaurant laughing about what had just happened, a man came running out of the restaurant towards us.  He stopped us, introduced himself, and apologized for the gum incident, offered to buy us a drink which we first appreciated but denied.  After a little more conversation, more apologizes he again offered to buy us a drink. I accepted his offer and he took us back the restaurant and promptly got us 2 glasses of wine.  He gave us his business card and told us to reach out to him personally if we decided to come back. 


We were treated with such respect by our server and the manager, Jerry.  We are a laid back couple, from a small town in Nebraska, who were in Vegas to enjoy our 5 year anniversary. We don't like special treatment, we aren't flashy, and are far from wealthy, 'hoity toity"" people.  To be treated the way were were treated was refreshing.


Honestly, the whole incident was hilarious to us (gross, but hilarious).  I am glad it happened to me, and not to someone who wouldn't have found it as funny as I did. It will not deter us from returning.  Thank you Jerry, and our server, whose name I wish I could remember for the great care!",Good,Bad,Good
I always make it a habit to stop in when I'm in Vegas. Best steak in Vegas!  Highly recommend coming in.,Good,Good,
"One of the best steak houses of Las Vegas, not only has a nice romantic decor but an outstanding selection of great wines, steaks, appetizers like the tuna tartare, the lettuce salad with blue cheese and the bone marrow.  Even the chilean sea bass was amazing, so if you are not a meat eater you can also have a nice dinner. The desserts are also out of this world",Good,Good,
"Last full day in Las Vegas on a 6-day visit to Las Vegas so we chose a restaurant inside our hotel, the Aria Resort and Casino.  The food was excellent and service impeccable.  We both ordered the 8-ounce Filet with mashed potatoes and truffle Mac and Cheese.  Our server, Eddie, along with several supporting staff too care of our needs, even before we asked.  At check-in the hostess asked for allergies.  How nice to have my needs met so that I can thoroughly enjoy my dinner.  Great choice!",Good,,Good
"Although online review sites and public relations departments across the city would have one believe otherwise, Jean Georges Steakhouse has been one of Las Vegas best ever since Chef Sean Griffin took over in 2015, and on Thursday evening he, Robert Phillips and team once again proved precisely why.


Now celebrating nearly a decade on Aria‚Äôs second floor, only it and The Buffet remaining since December 2009 while so much else has changed, it is immediately after eyes adjust to recessed lighting that guests find themselves amidst a well appointed room, background music never invasive but just loud enough to drown-out surrounding tables.


More swanky since a Summer 2017 rebrand, gold replacing red and several new service pieces helping bring Chefs tableside, it was as a party of seven including five first-timers that carte blanche was given to Chef Griffin, Wine and Cocktails quickly followed by buttery Loaves of Brioche and individual Amuse portions of Wagyu Beef draped over Choux with molten Cheese and truffled Mayonnaise.


Reined in slightly from past visits, a different crowd necessitating accessible flavors but at the same time agreeable to being more adventurous than usual, it was with share-plates set that course one featured two seasonally-dressed menu items plus Jean Georges‚Äô offering for #picnicinthepark, the Thai-inspired Wraps enjoyable with or without added heat but nonetheless unable to match snappy Shrimp wrapped in Bacon or creamy Duck Liver blended with Nuts and spread on Toast with Jam.


Using Salad as a segue to grilled Meats, the iconic Hearts of Palm and Tomatoes praised by all for its brightness while sliced Asparagus made new fans thanks to Nuts plus Mushrooms, it was with plates re-set that table quickly filled, a large central board of three Steaks from Greeley Colorado predictably gathering the most attention, in particular for the full-size Bone that one guest ascertained must be a prop from ‚ÄúThe Flintstones.‚Äù


Deferring temperature to the kitchen, diners typically used to Medium-Well or beyond pleasantly surprised by just how good a shade of pink can be when treated correctly, it was from sides including Mashed Potatoes and vibrant Snap Peas that many took large helpings, though those more knowledgeable went straight for sizable Belgian Asparagus with Ramps two-ways plus Parisian Gnocchi interspersed with roasted Morels and Fava Beans.  


Drawing eyes from around the room with Smoked Wagyu sliced tableside, a neighboring table even requesting a small slice of the residual end before ordering one of their own, it was with Beef soon gone that many reluctantly considered Chicken, though all who did immediately agreed that the combination of brining, grilling and light Tempura was an unanticipated highlight.


Now 9pm, two ‚Äústuffed‚Äù guests calling it a night before Dessert, those who remained were treated to the full array of Jean Georges Steakhouse sweets, both Cheesecake and the Molten Cake purportedly ‚Äúinvented‚Äù by Vongerichten gone fast while seasonal Citrus in the form of Cr√®me Brulee and Pound Cake each also performed well ‚Äì though by the end all agreed that they wished they had saved room for more of Sin City‚Äôs best Apple Pie or the Salted Caramel Sundae.",Good,Good,
"Great service, our waitress was chatty & very attentive without being evasive, we hadn't booked a table but they accommodated us, we were celebrating our wedding day.A little pricey but well worth the experience.",,Good,Good
"Second time was better in terms of a lovely waitress and speed of service but a chewy $64 NY Strip Steak is sad- I have had  better on my grill at home- the baked potato and asparagus were good but dinner for 3 with only 2 drinks and 1 desert that comes to $300 isn‚Äôt worth it.
Try a different place-",Bad,Bad,Good
"This is a very expensive enu. A fillet is $64,and thats all you get, not even a garnish. % of us ordered the sea bass, it was $45, a very small piece. It came with a mushroom side, all 5 were ice cold. Jack was a horrible waiter. Never checked how everythign was, nor if we wanted a second drink(which we did). Dont waste your time, go to Stk at cosmopolitan instead.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Four hour dinner on Tuesday night. We had to ask multiple times for more beverages. We had set menus and didn‚Äôt get all we ordered. It took an hour between dishes and then the portions were size of tapas. Sauces and bread were really good, but no way we will come back next year. We had a 7 pm reservation and showed up at 6:45 hoping to meet a 9:30 show that we all missed. 


Not worth what they charged us.",Bad,Bad,Bad

"This restaurant was a disappointment to my family (grandpa, parents and two kids ages 9 &12).  We were fully prepared for the pricetag and excited about Japanese Waygu beef and the Tomahawk, but I wholeheartedly expect that when you are paying at the very top of market for any steakhouse in the U.S. and order a medium rare steak it will not arrive medium well.  To their credit they recognized their error immediately and brought another one but of our two steaks, neither arrived cooked as ordered (the second one arrived medium instead of medium rare) and the total bill for 5 people (two of whom were children) without liquor but including tip was over 1k.  Not acceptable and reflective of poor training in the kitchen and lack of management oversight.  Those steaks should have been perfect considering the beef came all the way from Japan.


Additionally, service was so slow that of the 5 of us, my husband was the only one not falling asleep to the noisy din of the room.  Lastly, we found it extremely annoying that they have a professional photographer going around hawking photos because every two minutes when her dumb flash when off it reflected off the enormous mirror behind the bar into our eyes.  Lastly, the music seemed out of date and out of touch with the sleekness and classiness of the ambience.


My only shout out is to the sommelier - we told him our preferences and gave him a budget and he was able to recommend a bottle to our taste and actually under budget.",Bad,Bad,Bad
My son and I stayed at the Aria resort the beginning of April and made reservations at Jean Georges Steakhouse.  It was truly amazing.  The filet and mashed potatoes were truly incredible.  We will definitely go back when we get back to Vegas,Good,,
"My ribeye was PERFECT!  I never get a steak that is right on the 1st try.  My waiters(yep- you get 2) we‚Äôre absolutely wonderful... Nate and Matt.  They Were right on with everything that they suggested all of it was a hit.  I had an avocado, heart of palm and cucumber salad as s starter... normally not my deal... I give that thing a 10+.  The Drinks we had were the best we had since in Las Vegas.  I had a couple cucumber martinis while my husband had the best in  life old fashions made with some kind of  Japanese whiskey...so good!   I definitely recommend going here even if it‚Äôs s little out of your way.  The atmosphere was perfect as well.   And I can‚Äôt say enough about Nate and Matt, they were very good about my food allergies as well.  Very in tune to what each has.",Good,Good,Good
"Had a business meal last night.  I just can't get past how outrageously expensive this place was.  


Started at a round table that was so wobbly we had to move.


Many at the table had wine.  Two asked for a specific type of wine and the first one recommended didn't meet their stated preferences.  The second did.


Had a few appetizers including a seafood sampler.  Was good.  Large crab legs and shrimp.


Main dishes were good.  Had a nice 8 oz filet - but it wasn't enough to justify the prices.  Sides were very small, but again expensive.


Restaurant was nice.  Staff were friendly and generally attentive.  Food was good - but I've had equivalent at nowhere near these prices.


I just can't recommend a place that so egregiously over prices everything on the menu.",Bad,Good,Good
"While on vacation, my husband and I chose this restaurant for my 50th birthday and enjoyed everything about it.
The food, service, ambience and having an on site photographer to capture great memories, made our experience truly wonderful.

I‚Äôll definitely recommend this restaurant and hope to return sometime.",Good,Good,Good

Couldn't be better,  Maybe best Sea Bass ever.",Good,,Good
"Valentines Day many restaurants can be hit and miss.  They are usually packed full of people, and people expect a fantastic meal when dinning out with their someone special.  Well this restaurant really knocked it out of the park for Valentines day.  My wife and I were in the mood for Crab Legs as an appetizer which were not on the menu as such.  We figured maybe the Add on to the steak would be possible, and asked our waitress.  In no time at all they had some of the best crab legs brought out with Atomic Horseradish and Cocktail Sauce.  A real treat that should be a regular menu option!  The Main Course (Filet Steak) was as expected, very good.  For a place this busy to be this on point is a real testament to how good it is.  This isn't our first time here, and it will not be our last.  I just hope they can maintain this as a great staple in Las Vegas.",Good,Good,
"I came to this restaurant with a business group and we had a set menu.  I chose the rib-eye as it was their specialty.  It was full of grizzle, unfortunately.  It was 22 oz and most of it was  left on the plate.  I really liked the ambience, however.  It is a great place to have a date night.",Bad,Good,
"Lived in Aria and wanted to try their steak restaurant. Ate a 18 oz prime rib-in rib eye with their mashed potatoes. Simply fantastic! Maybe best I had in many years. If you want to spend some money on fantastic meat, there are few places that can match this. The bread you get in the beginning is insanely good.",Good,,
Business partner and I ate here a week ago. Steak absolutely incredible. Started off with Oysters. Best I have ever had.,Good,,

Had a business dinner at Jean Georges Steakhouse in Las Vegas and the service and food was excellent.  Nice place for a dinner meeting and we were seated right away and the food was very good.  Great steak and everything was great.,Good,Good,Good
The food at this place was amazing. Overall great experience with Good and friendly staff. The tables were a little to close together and the noise level was a little to loud to make it an excellent date nite but overall a wonderful experience.,Good,Good,Good
"Food is good, but service is HORRIBLE.  We were celebrating our friend‚Äôs 40th birthday at this restaurant after a phenomenal experience at the Scottsdale location. Our reservation was at 6:45 pm. We arrived on time and still had to wait on a table. 


To say the level of service was subpar is an understatement. 


We mentioned to our waiter we had to leave at 9 pm. A 6:45 pm dinner reservation should be plenty of time to accomplish this.  They poured our water quickly and took our drink orders.  We received our drinks a few minutes later, but then waited 45 minutes until they came to take appetizer orders.  At that point is when we had to ask to bread service with our appetizer order.  


I asked to speak to a manager and then explained the situation above.  He did not initially apologize and simply stated that he would ‚Äúlook into this.‚Äù  


He questioned our servers and then returned to state, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what is going on, but I am sorry and dessert is on me.‚Äù  It was at that point I informed him we still didn‚Äôt have bread service, which came shortly thereafter (now almost an hour into us being seated).  I thought all was well after this, but it‚Äôs gets worse...


At this point, we had to get in both our appetizer and dinner options at the same time. 


My friend and I ordered butternut squash soup. They brought us white bean soup. We had to wait on them to make the correct soup.  Then came the remaining appetizers, but no plates.  We only had our bread plates to eat off of.  


I would also like to point out that at no time were we given any information on specials or details about the menu.  Not once did they ask us if we had any questions about the menu.  There was never a point during our dining experience that anyone asked us how the food was or if we needed anything else.  We repeatedly had to ask for water to be refilled.  


One friend ordered the sea bass and another had a filet.  Both arrived cold and had to be sent back.  If I had to guess, the kitchen made those entrees with our appetizers and held them back until the appetizers were served and cleared. 


The sea bass came back at a decent time.  The friend with the filet didn‚Äôt get her entree until everyone else was finished with their meals and now it was 8:50pm and they were going to have to rush bringing out dessert.  


The desserts came out and then we sent our husbands out to call an Uber so we could quickly get to the show since we are already running behind.  It was after that that they brought out the ‚Äúbirthday dessert‚Äù at 9:10pm, but it was too late for that given we had already sent the birthday boy and his friends out of the restaurant.  One would think the birthday dessert would be brought out with the rest of the desserts.


We asked for the bill and were informed it takes approximately 8 minutes to process a room charge.  I was expecting that they would have removed the filet for my friend that was sent back cold and didn‚Äôt return until much later, and possibly also removing the sea bass given that was initially served cold also.  Neither were removed from the bill.  We asked for the manager and he acknowled that he was aware those entrees were sent back.  He adjusted the bill and then we confirmed the desserts were comped, and quickly headed out of the restaurant.  Wait, it gets worse.....


My friend was reviewing the bill later that evening and noticed a charge for a wine bottle we never had - for $535.  We had ordered 2 bottles of wine, which were on the bill correctly.  We never had a 3rd bottle and certainly not for $535.  That charge had to be disputed with the hotel the following morning. 


Last but not least, the bathrooms were a mess. Toilet paper all over the floor and dirty toilets.  Certainly not what you expect in a high end steakhouse.  


I don‚Äôt expect to pay close to $2,000 for a meal and get service like this for a party of 8.  This ruined our friend‚Äôs 40th birthday.  Service was so bad that they should have provided our entire meal complimentary. 


We were late to our show and missed the opening act.  While multiple conversations with the manager resulted in them removing the 2 cold entrees and comping our desserts, this does not rectify the experience we had for our friend‚Äôs 40th birthday celebration.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Took kids there for NY Eve and found it to be a beautiful resturant, with a great menu and excellent service.  WAS DARN EXPENSIVE, but actually worth it for the quality.
The family loved the meat and I had the best Sea Bass I've ever had.


Great Desserts too!


Worth a try for a special occasion.",Good,,Good
If you want a great steak and an even better seafood appetizer that is more like a meal eat here.  The  seafood appetizers came out fast and were wonderful.  The waygu filet melted into your mouth and was perfect.,Good,,
"While staying at the Aria we wanted to try a new steakhouse. Staff suggested Jean George...reservations were made and a dining experience was about to begin. My wife's shrimp cocktail was presented artfully and was delicious (she says). My Caesar salad was a bit different, as most are similar, because the dressing had a special ingredient...again, delicious. Our Porterhouse was cooked to perfection and very tasty. Our two side dished  completed a delightful dining experience. We will return.",Good,Good,
"The food is Exquisite but pricey.  Best to get there early if you want a table,  The steaks are out of this world!",Good,,
"Let me start off by stating, if you look at my reviews, you will see I have only posted one other negative review.  I regret that this will be my second.


I hosted a group of ten business people for a customer dinner and wanted an impressive venue to properly entertain some important clients.  Jean George's came recommended.  


We made dinner reservations at 8pm and upon arrival were informed that our table was still occupied and we needed to wait about 15 minutes.  OK, no big deal.  We waited 15 minutes and were then told that the table was still occupied and the restaurant was not sure how much longer it would be.  So, we went to the bar and ordered drinks.  Our bartender was really good, although for a restaurant this size, there were only two bartenders.  He created and served 10 cocktails very quickly.  If we had been seated on time, we could have easily ordered two rounds of drinks in an hour.  Lost revenue and tips for Jean George.


At 9pm, we were finally seated.  Our server was very knowledgeable, but was also serving at least three other tables, so the service was extremely slow.  After our appetizers finally arrived and were enjoyed, we had to pile the empty plates in the middle of the table ourselves as no one came to remove them.  One of my colleagues had to eventually get up and find a server to take away the empty plates.  Embarrassing.


Dinner was finally served at 10:15pm, but by that time, everyone was tired and had really lost our appetite.  We enjoyed the food, but the lack of prompt service really ruined the experience of the meal and lost additional revenue for the restaurant.


Our server did realize that the service was slow and said the kitchen was backed up.  She did comp us for one round of drinks.  However, this was a business meal with clients and what we wanted was a fabulous experience, not free drinks.


My suggestion to Jean George - hire more staff.  You will give your customers a much better experience and increase your profitability.",,Bad,Bad
"An absolutely delicious evening!! I myself am a pescatarian as where my husband is not. He loves a good steak house and although I have found it easier over the years it still feels like there are never too many options for me when we. go to them - then we came here.
Everything start to finish was absolutely delicious! They offered several fish specials - along with steak and other proteins. 
We look forward to making it a staple of our Vegas vacations.",Good,,
"Nice ambience and the food is of a very high quality. However I am not sure the prices warrant the experience. Our server got my order totally wrong and then rushed it so that I could have my meal at the same time as my husband, which made it probably not as good as it should have been. I ordered a sea bass that came with a very dry wild mushroom. Mt meal was OK I would not say it blew me away for the price. My husband ordered the wagu beef and that was very nice. The choice of sides is also excellent and very tasty. 


When the bill came we were charged for a drink we didn‚Äôt have. Check your bill before you pay!  Honestly the two of us cost $400 for dinner for a special occasion. It was very good but for that price I expect to be wowed by the service. Unfortunately that fell short",Bad,Good,Bad
This is our favorite Steakhouse at the Aria; You will enjoy the gorgeous atmosphere and attentive staff!! The steak and seafood are wonderful; and we enjoy the soups and sides and desserts!! Wagu filet and lobster and squash soup are some favorites and of course the drinks too!! We enjoy spending birthdays and anniversaries at this dining destination!!,Good,Good,Good
Off the beaten path and we loved it! Comfortable atmosphere and relaxed seating. Staff was nice and we felt well taken care of. Food was amazing and worth the high price. We will be back again.,Good,Good,Good
I ordered the 8oz filet and it was prepared and seasoned perfectly. My wife had the miso glazed sea bass and the glaze was super sweet and so over powering couldn‚Äôt taste the fish.  They also made an excellent Manhattan.,Good,,
"I loved everything!! The ambiance, food and service were all 5 star. Great place to take a date.  I don‚Äôt know where to begin... it all started from the bread and butter. It couldn‚Äôt possibly taste better. I could have made that a meal.  Then my filet came. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. My girlfriend had the sea bass and absolutely loved it. We both shared the Brussels sprouts and agreed they were one of the best we‚Äôve had.. if you‚Äôre looking for a really cool, hip and sexy place that has the best service in Vegas then this is it!!",Good,Good,Good
"Pricey as one would expect for a steakhouse, in Vegas and  JGV venue, but worth every penny. The Octopus was fresh and delicious, the Peppercorn lacquered smoked Wagyu Brisket one of the closest experiences to paradise a meat eater can have. Service was top notch team style and winelist is appropriate to all the expectations of a place like this. Thank you JG and team. This venue just MAY have surpassed Prime (also JGV) as my fav North American Resto.",Good,Good,Good
The ambiance was amazing! The food was spectacular! I would recommend just eating at the bar if it was a short visit. Worth a visit!,Good,Good,
"Sad to say this place was a total letdown. We had been very, very excited to come here because about 7 years back we remembered it as the best steak ever had but, seems like things have gone downhill. It wasn't bad - it was certainly a better steak than most (really, for the cost, it should be), but the service is truly terrible. 


This restaurant is 1 of only 9 in the US that serves real Kobe beef - if you are not familiar with REAL Kobe beef, it is actually very fatty and rich. Suggestion is to order a regular wagyu and 3oz of the Kobe to try, unless you know what you're getting. 


Steak quality and the 4 sauces offered is good. 


We were seated relatively quickly with a reservation, and a waiter brought us the menus. After an intro to the menu, he disappeared. At this time we noticed one of our drink glasses had a very odd mark inside - it wasn't a bug or food, but literally looked like either melted wax or marker - wouldn't be a big deal if it was on the outside, but it was the inside. No joke it took about 10 minutes to catch ANYONE's attention to change it out... and then that person wasn't even our waiter, so we couldn't order. Finally we ordered - wagyu and fries for him, salad for me, and Kobe beef to come out right after the wagyu. 


After ordering, bread came. We were pretty famished as it's been about 20min since being seated now. We asked for another. It didn't come. 


Wagyu and salad came out relatively quickly after order. The tomato salad was exceptionally fresh. The fries never came. Nor did the second order of bread. Another 15 minutes goes by. We're wondering where the Kobe is too. Looking around, it's not like it's overly crowded. Plenty of tables empty an open. We're beyond frustrated right now - especially bc we have a show to catch. We gave ourselves 2 hours for dinner and as 2 people we can't understand how and why it's talking so long. 


Waiter comes. We ask him to cancel the fries bc we don't want them anymore and they're not here, mention we still haven't received the second bread, and ask where the Kobe is. I swear it's like they just forgot to put the order in, because after 5 minutes, they bring it all - including the fries which they say is ""comped.""


We're done within minutes. After about 10 minutes, waiter reappears with 2 desserts and advises that they're both free of charge because they ""appreciate our patience"" - molten cake and cheesecake. Neither of us wanted dessert, much less 2 - we would've preferred drinks comped, my salad comped - literally anything. 


For a $500 meal (for 2 people - not including drinks), we were appalled by the lack of service and slow timing of everything. The restaurant was probably only at 50% capacity so it's not like there was good reason for it. The steak quality was NOT exceptional enough to outweigh the Bad (seriously, hillstone/Houston's probably better), and we definitely will not be returning or recommending.",Good,Bad,Bad
"It was October 2015 when Jean Georges Steakhouse at Aria first stirred interest, the Restaurant described by a local culinary curmudgeon as ‚ÄúPrime‚Äôs hipster cousin‚Äù suddenly producing Food that looked far more interesting than that at Bellagio thanks to the relocation of Chef Sean Griffin, and on Saturday as a it was Griffin and his team who managed to raise the bar even higher.


Now the eleventh visit to Aria‚Äôs only remaining second story Restaurant since opening, this time on the eve of CES with a group large enough to fill a Private Dining Room labeled ‚ÄúChef‚Äôs Table,‚Äù it was minutes to 6:30pm that ten guests were led to a space customizable for lights and music, the atmosphere made even better by educated service including several tableside presentations from both Sean and Chef Robert Phillips.  


Presented in five courses over the course of three hours, Prix Fixe Carte Blanche deferred to the kitchen as some guests sipped Wines by the glass, it was shortly after the Steakhouse‚Äôs golden Brioche that a mix of old and new arrived, the crispy Rice beneath raw Fish and Gougeres draped in razor-thin Beef as good as ever while two styles of Foie Gras impressed first seared with a mixture of sweet and savory but then more so chilled and reminiscent of Halva thanks to a Almonds in the Terrine  and Pistachios ground on top.


Moving next to Salad, Griffin‚Äôs skills with Produce and willingness to create fully-Vegan meals inside a Steakhouse perhaps even more striking than the high-quality Animals featured, those craving Tomatoes in the middle of Winter should take heed of Jean Georges thick slices topped in Hearts of Palm and creamy Coconut, though seasonal items including Caesar a la Kale and crisp Endives topped with Pears plus toasted Quinoa are equally well balanced and built to share. 


Onward to the Sea at this point, all guests waiting with bated breath as Chef Phillips shaved White Truffles over textbook Risotto with Lobster, Balsamic Vinegar and lots of Butter, it was in three additional plates that Vongerichten‚Äôs influence was clearly evident, the Shrimp given a bit of spice cooled by Yogurt while both the signature Sea Bass and seasonal Scallops saw Citrus with Soy build layers of flavor that highlight Meat and Produce without being overwhelming.


Attempting best to graze without going all-in thus far, previous experience still not fully preparing guests for what was about to happen, it was on two large carts that boards of Meat were wheeled in hot off the grill, the Mishima Ranch Brisket immediately catching eyes as Sean sliced through it like Butter while Robert pulled out a blowtorch to caramelize two half-femurs of Bone Marrow tableside.


Again mixing signatures with specials as Sides, the Mushrooms and three styles of Spuds all remaining worthwhile choices, those seeking something new were treated to tender Onions with Hazelnuts as well as Brussels and Pecans, though neither those nor anything else served on this night could compare to Honey-soaked Squash that was smashed and Tempura-fried before being topped liberally with White Truffles from Alba. 


Not forgetting about the Meat, both Beef and Lamb as well as Las Vegas‚Äô best Fried Chicken all accounted for, most agreed that the Porterhouse and Tomahawk were standouts though one attested Filet Mignon with B√©arnaise was ‚Äúpure heaven‚Äù while two of JG‚Äôs Wagyu-Fat-fortified Cheeseburgers also lived up to a personal belief that it is still the best gourmet combination of Patty and Toppings tasted to date.


Saving a sliver of stomach space for Dessert, though making sure not one bit of Squash went to waste, it was mostly classics that comprised two platters alongside a Salted Caramel Sundae for the youngster, recently-debuted Lemon Pound Cake offering a delicate crumb and lots of flavor but still not enough to supplant Jean Georges Market Apple Pie as the ‚Äúmust have‚Äù finish to any visit.


FIVE STARS:  Even just sticking to the classics Jean Georges Steakhouse would stand out as a result of Ingredient sourcing and Chef Griffin‚Äôs skills, but for those willing to give their keys to the kitchen there is not a shred of doubt that Aria Las Vegas is home to America‚Äôs most complete and creative Steakhouse.",Good,Good,
Good restaurant in Vegas for meat lovers. As usual quite expensive but that‚Äôs Vegas. The wine list is also very interesting.,Good,,
An amazing experience having meat in the USA. We were dlighted to have dinner at the venue. Strongly recomended.,Good,Good,
"This restaurant in the incredible Aria hotel in Las Vegas, is a must go to place, especially the Kobe 5 steak was to good be through!!!


Incredible wine list great service great atmosphere 


Just go before the gambling, you want to spent your money on the great menu , and winning is easier after a very special dinner experience (I think )",Good,Good,Good
"I had the pleasure of eating here with my two girls ages 12/10 in December of 2018. We are well travelled when it comes to steak houses and have experienced the best of the best and worst of the worst. 
This establishment tops a long list of one of the best steak houses we have eaten at on the planet. 


 The service was outstanding with James and John starting the meal with bread, drinks, and a knowledge of the menu that would‚Äôve impressed Mr. George himself if he were present. Service was spot on and excellent. James and John were both engaging with my children and actually started a trivia game with them. It was one of the best nights of their dining lives. 


 I was surprised to read the other issues diners have had with the food quality. The weekend before we ate here we had Japanese A5 Kobe Ribeye at the Wynn in Macau, China. That was a ‚Äútop of the world cut‚Äù without a doubt. The Prime steak I had at Jean Georges was as good, if not better, than the Kobe Wagyu offering in China. The sauces they served with the beef are some of the most unique and flavorful I have ever had. As a general rule we never add anything to Prime or better steak but these sauces were so good we asked for seconds and thirds. 


 The GM visited our table several times  during the meal to make sure everything was perfect. The icing on the cake (pun partially intended) was when the chef visited our table with a complimentary desert sampler. The deserts, like the rest of the meal, were incredible. 


 I can not speak more highly of a dining experience than the one we had at Jean Georges in the Aria. What a fantastic staff they have in place there. Thank you for a world class evening.",Good,Good,Good
If you want to pay a huge amount of money for a so so steak go ahead and visit here. Just because something is expensive doesn't mean its great. Seriously. Find a Cattlemans or spend your money at Ruths Crist. The atmosphere is pretty good and the servers very good. However I am not into snobs and 50 bucks for just a steak that is gristle and not cooked properly. A companion sent hers back and it still wasn't right. Seared on the outside but still not medium like she ordered. Everything here is over priced and just not worth it.,Bad,Good,Good
"With disappointment, how the mighty fall. Having recommended JG for years, I am sorry to say that they have read their press clippings and don't feel the need to not provide even average service for very expensive food.  Ate there this past weekend and there were many open tables in prime time and while food is tasty, the servers were as inattentive as I can recall. Steak came out cold, and we waited for a very long time. Server blamed it on kitchen yet we never had her come by.  
There are many choices for excellent service and food in Vegas.  The management is not paying attention to their customers and I will likely not return anytime soon.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We came here for thanksgiving dinner. We had reservations and showed up 30 mins early. The hostess had no problem seating us early. The service was excellent, we never had an empty water /tea glass.  During our time here , we never felt rushed at all. Our party of 3 had steak,salmon and veal. All entrees were excellent. While they are known for their steaks, my daughter thought the salmon was the best she‚Äôs ever had. The veal was a large portion and could have had a little more flavor but still good. My husband had no complaints about his steak. Side dishes are extra. I would recommend the brussel sprouts.  For 3 entrees, 3 sides, 1 salad and one dessert, along with 1 ice tea..including tip it was approximately $300 which seems what you pay in Las Vegas for fine dining.  We will definitely be back.",Good,Good,Good
"I recently ate at JG and found the experience to be a little lacking based on the reviews. 


The service was great - everyone was friendly. 


The atmosphere was nice - as to be expected in Vegas at a high end steak restaurant. 


The steak was disappointing. I really had much higher expectations. When compared to all the steak restaurants I have enjoyed in the last, this steak was on the lower end in terms of the enjoyment, the flavor, the texture. It was cooked just the way I ordered it so that was not the problem. 


Overall a fairly Good but I think I would explore other options before going back.",Bad,Good,Good
"The food was not exceptional, especially considering the high cost. There were 6 in our group; 4 had meat, 1 chicken, and 1 salmon. One of the steaks was ordered medium but came as medium rare but he didn't want to send it back. The chicken was - well chicken. The salmon was good, but no better than others at 1/3 the cost. The size portions on the sides was small. But this is Vegas - so just be prepared to spend a lot but not necessarily get what you pay for!",Bad,,
Good steakhouse in Aria. I had the wedge salad and the 8 oz. filet mignon . Also split the asparagus and all of it was excellent. The meal took a little too long to arrive after the salads.,Good,,Bad
"I dined here alone while on a business trip and sat at the bar.  The service was great and the 8 oz filet was great.  Steak house can be expensive, but overall I felt it was fairly price given Vegas standards.


(My only small complaint was I didn't care for the mushrooms.  Seemed a but rubbery)",Good,,Good
First off - we were prepared to spend a good amount.  We did NOT go crazy though by ordering Wagu beef at $60/ounce.  our steaks were delicious and prepared as requested.  Wait staff very attentive.  My hubby n I had 1 cocktail.  1/2 bottle of wine.  1 app.  2 sides.  2 entrees and 2 teas. (No dessert) bill was $375 before tip.  They also served us a  truffle Mac n cheese on the house.  All over very nice night.  Not rushed even though one of last to leave (we had a 10:00 pm reservation),Good,Good,Good
"Our party of 5 opted to sit at the bar. Alan, the bartender, took great care of us. I tasted a little of everyone‚Äôs dish. It was alll amazing.",Good,,Good
"Note: this review comes from someone who has eaten in many of the best steakhouses in the United States. Charlie Palmer, Jeff Ruby, Peter Luger, Pine Club, BLT, Prime, etc. 


My girlfriend and I came in for dinner during our stay in Vegas. She had never had A5 Wagyu before, so I thought we would stop in here considering its proximity to our hotel. 


I‚Äôll make this short. Do yourself a favor and go to Cut, Prime, or STK. It‚Äôll be pricey, but you won‚Äôt get screwed on service. Pay attention to the recent reviews ‚Äî this place has gone downhill. 


We spent over $750 for the two of us. She had one cocktail and one glass of wine. The Wagyu was reasonably priced at $60/oz, and it was fantastic. The rest of it was incredibly overpriced. This would have been a $500 meal pretty much anywhere else. 


After having spent that much cash, the waitstaff didn‚Äôt bother coming back to check on us. We were finished eating for over 20 minutes when I finally flagged someone down to box our food. We didn‚Äôt even have time for desert due to our wait. If this was Cheesecake Factory or something like that, I would understand. But I expect more from a place billing itself as a world class steakhouse. It isn‚Äôt.",Bad,Bad,Bad
We visited on a Tuesday evening and the place was packed. Service was on the slow side and the steaks were disappointing. The 18 oz. rib-eye was 1/2 grizzle and sure not worth the price. My strip loin was on the cool side and that was unacceptable. Poor experience overall.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"Was staying @ hotel so decided to dine @ JG  since I have  dine @ his CPW LOCATION IN MANHATTAN & in Bridgehampton New York 


JG IS a top of the line restaurant 
What a disappointment 
Flatware was dirty 
Service was awful 
Food was cold had to sent back


When I return to room  spent the evening in the bathroom 


Need I elaborate any more",Bad,Bad,Bad
"My husband had to have Wugyu beef, and this place had it as a brisket (cheaper option).  At $80/plate, overpowered with hot spices and too much fat, I didn‚Äôt enjoy the brisket.  Add a side of asparagus, which was delicious, and 2 wedge salads and our bill for 2 was over $300.  They did give us free little treats for our anniversary.",Bad,,
"We ate at Jean Georges on a Sunday night.  I first went alone and the hostess said I needed a reservation, but I could sit at the bar, so I did.  Then a group of friends invited me to sit at their table.  Not sure why she didn't give me a table because there were a few empty tables all evening.
I the wine list was pretty good, but very pricey.  I don't mind paying 2x or even 3x sometimes, but 4x and 5x are unacceptable.
I got the 14 oz prime strip steak @ $62.  It was very good and a tender piece of meat, but I've had way better at Old Homestead at Borgatta for less money.


Overall I think it is pretty good, but there are a lot of better options for less $$.",Good,Good,
"My wife and I were treated to a wonderful meal at Jean George Steakhouse while in Las Vegas recently.  The steaks melted in our mouths and the array of sauces were delicious.  The tuna tartare starter was outstanding.  When we return next year, we will definitely splurge again for a great meal.",Good,Good,
"We enjoyed an end-of-season team weekend in LV and chose Jean Georges as the location for our 'treat' dinner (10 of us). The restaurent is hidden in the bowels of the impressive Aria hotel and occupies a dark but nicely lit space. 
We were given the private dining room and were very well taken care of by the excellent team there. Food was all nicely done, steaks impeccable - as you would expect - and sides all outstanding too. The wine list is seriously pricey but we found a very tasty Priorat that was a little less eye-watering!
I would return either for a business dinner or with my wife, no problem.",Good,Good,Good
"This was one of the best food experiences of my life. The A5 Kobe beef was a one in a lifetime experience. Sadly, it was the worst customer service from our incredibly grumpy and rude waiter. He acted like we were a bother and was not happy to be serving us. It was unbelievable. When you are ordering a $180 3 oz steak, a smile would be nice.",Good,Good,Bad
"My buddies and I went there because we wanted to try Kobe beef which was excellent..... although expensive as expected.   But in addition to the steak we also got salmon which was excellent and the sides are large enough to share with table.


 Very cool and modern atmosphere is well!",Good,Good,
"Nice ambience and the steaks, both the 8oz filet and 14 oz strip were excellent
Saut√©ed spinach and fries were good.
Nice oysters. Sides can be shared-I HAD TO ASK.
Quite expensive- try the 1/2 bottle of wine if you only want 2 glasses.
Large cocktails.
I would have given this 5 stars but service was slow and the waiters were inattentive and it took quite a while for the wine to show up and after the first glass being poured for us the waiter got lost!",Good,,Bad
"We enjoyed excellent food and service at Jean-Georges Steakhouse Las Vegas. We started with oysters (east and west coast), grilled octopus and calamari. We continued with lobster and sea bass.",Good,,Good
"We went there with a few colleagues after a conference and enjoyed their private room. It is quite nice if you are a group, as it allows for more privacy and everybody can easily discuss with the rest of the group as well. Food was delightful, I would recommend a steak (no surprise here) and if you can, a surf n turf. While we were there, their surf n turf was a 6oz Wagyu Beef Filet with Lobster, and it was wonderful. They also have a great variety of drinks, whiskeys, and wines. Best restaurant in the Aria. It is pretty expensive as a downside (that surf n turf was 179$).",Good,Good,
Excellent food with a group of friends. Bone Marrow was excellent a must try! Overall service was excellent. Great time!,Good,Good,Good
"The service and the 18oz Prime Bone-in Ribeye were both average. For the price, I was expecting someone incredible and I was kind of disappointed.",Bad,,Bad
"Two companions and I dined at Jean Georges.  We loved the atmosphere and the wait staff was top notch.  Some highlights were the Wagyu Beef, The Chilean Sea Bass, and the Prime Filet Mignon.  Wine list was good.  Truffle Mac and Cheese was delicious, as was the Market Apple Pie.  We thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant and will return.",Good,Good,Good
This was our best meal in Vegas. It was a very expensive meal but well worth for the quality service and amazing food. They can even custom the meals for a gluten free choice if required. We had the steak and chicken which was phenomenal. Excellent choice and will definitely return.,Good,Good,Good
"Possible the best meal I‚Äôve ever had. The smoked wagyu brisket sliced table-side was straight phenomenal. The garlic mashed potatoes with it were a cherry on top.  The staff was great and it was a wonderful experience overall. However as I didn‚Äôt pick up the tab for the meal I assume I may feel a little less exuberance if I had.  
My wife veal chop was also great, but that was that was the opinion on everything we tried.",Good,Good,Good
"Now an annual tradition in its fourth year it was on Saturday night that six guys sat down to Steak, the second consecutive at Jean George Steakhouse and a tasting proposed by Chef Robert Phillips not quite as epic as meals past, but continuing to show why Aria may just posses the best Steakhouse in America directly next to a Brasserie deserving similar accolades.


Always a busy room on weekends, though on this particular night quiet early as other Las Vegas visitors tuned into GGG versus √Ålvarez part two, it was at precisely 7:30pm that the party was greeted by hostesses, a confirmed reservation leading to seats at a semicircular banquet just outside the Restaurant‚Äôs private dining room where music plays less loudly than elsewhere.


Noting both new and old faces amongst a well trained front of house, this evening‚Äôs waitress a middle-age Woman whose knowledge of Bourbon went over well with connoisseurs, it was after Water and Drinks were served that palates were readied by seasonal Gazpacho, the up-front Fruit and linger of Basil expectedly refreshing and leading well into warm Brioche meant to be slathered liberally with Herb Butter.  


Served family style following a second Amuse of Golden Osetra Caviar atop Meyer Lemon Gelee with Creme Fraiche, approximately three spoonfuls of luxury leading many to wonder whether this or last year‚Äôs Egg Toast was better, it was not long after that course one arrived family-style, Foie Gras plus two each of Jean Georges Crispy Sushi and Wagyu Carpaccio gone almost immediately while Salads featuring sweetness, earth, heat and Mint seemed a bit too busy and were decidedly less popular.


At this point slowing down, spoons of Lemon Sorbet offered to cleanse the mouth in preparation of a second course that combined what has typically been offered as separate rounds of Fish and heavier Meats, it was by request that one of JG‚Äôs juicy Cheeseburger‚Äôs fortified with Wagyu Fat was divided by six, all agreeing that taste and grind rank high amongst the best there is while Sean Griffin‚Äôs current Salmon set-up including Citrus and Corn comes across more cohesive than steamed Halibut that is beautifully prepared but a little overwhelmed by intense Green Olive Dressing.


Working with a full table at this point, no new Sides on display but all the old-favorites offered as good as ever with Summer Corn, Crunchy Potatoes and Spuds enriched with Lobster most noteworthy, it was largely passing on Sauces save for Vongerichten‚Äôs Soy Miso Butter that Smoked Brisket and Chateaubriand took center stage, the former still turning heads even without tableside carving and remaining unmatched in terms of texture while two Bone-in pounds of Beef from Colorado did not lag far behind as presented medium-rare.


Certainly not missing out on Bone Marrow, two roasted Femurs finished on Toast by those with remaining capacity, it was on request that Coffee was served alongside Dessert, a special request seeing two of the Steakhouse‚Äôs world-class Apple Pie arrive on a lengthy plank alongside Jean Georges signature molten Chocolate Cake plus a round of Cheesecake served alongside a sphere containing Sour Cherries and smooth Sorbet.


Not as majestic a feast as some at the Aria‚Äôs second floor mainstay, stunted pacing and a lack of novel sides making one wonder if Chef Griffin‚Äôs time away opening MGM Springfield may have hampered creativity during Las Vegas‚Äô slow season, Jean Georges Steakhouse remains a destination for anyone visiting Las Vegas, though one hopes the team hasn‚Äôt let their foot off the gas just because their greatest competitor recently shuttered.",Good,Good,Good
"My husband and I came here for my birthday and were greeted right away with complimentary prosecco which was delicious as well as an amuse bouche. We ordered the bone in rib eye with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. All were so amazing and mouth watering. We loved all of the sauces that accompany the meal and highlight different flavors in each dish. I loved the bread and butter at the beginning of the meal as well. We were also surprised by an inventive chocolate egg dessert that we cracked to reveal candies, for my birthday. Overall it was the perfect dinner for our occasion and I highly recommend the rib eye!!",Good,Good,
"My friends and I dropped in Monday night of an excellent dinner. Had a great bottle of wine. The atmosphere was great, the music was not too loud. The service was really great. The were on top of our every need.",Good,Good,Good
"First off, this place is pricier BUT it sells an experience. We never mind paying that extra bit for a meal when the whole evening is an experience to remember.


Right from the moment we entered and the Hostess greeted us with a warm welcome and ""happy anniversary"" (it must have been on their system when we gave her our Mlife card), to the waitress and many other wait staff that make the process seamless. 


The wine list is extensive and the cocktails are fantastic. I had a Lychee Bellini and i highly recommend. Our waitress introduced herself and the two other gentlemen who would be tending our table, and they were all very professional, friendly, and you could tell take pride in their jobs. Everyone who worked they took a moment to come and thank us for coming in and a happy anniversary. It didn't feel intrusive at all and felt very special. 


We asked for recommendations to which our waitress had answers to everything. She was very knowledgable and fun to talk with.


There's in-house made fresh bread to start you off (oh my god - unbelievable)
We had a Waygu Carpaccio to start (you need this in your life)
The Chef gave us a complementary pallet cleanser (a citrusy tarte drink) for our anniversary,
We shared a 34oz Porter House with a side of Bone Marrow (it's giant, beautiful and super tasty!)
And we were also surprised with a special dessert. It was a chocolate ball which has ""happy anniversary"" written on it and you smashed it with a hammer and their were chocolate and cocia covered nuts inside. It was fun, unexpected, light and perfect sweet touch for the end of our meal.


We left very happy and have many fun stories to share. Our special day was made more special by many staff who went out of their way to make sure our night was fantastic and they succeeded. Can't wait to come back.",Good,Good,Good
"9 pm reservation, promptly seated.   House music playing, but at a great conversation level, able to hear my date clearly.  The service was first class.  And the meal was perfect.   One of the best Rib-eye steaks I have ever had.  My date agreed with me !   The octopus appetizer was excellent.  And, the apple pie dessert was perfect !
And a great selection of great wines !",Good,Good,Good
The food was sooooo amazing my steak was seasoned perfectly and sauce what sauce lol. I needed nothing but the silverware,Good,,
The Jean Georges Steakhouse in Aria offers the finest in steakhouse dining in a contemporary setting with attentive service and quality.,,Good,Good
"Got to restaurant 15 minutes late due to overwhelming traffic Labor Day weekend. Smartass young guy at front desk told us with a slight smirk that ‚Äúwe were late and he had canceled our reservations‚Äù and to ‚Äúgo somewhere else‚Äù. Checking open table found there were seats available 15 min later! Complained and was haughtingly seated. 


Don‚Äôt care how good the food is, with service like this they should be ashamed to call themselves a first class establishment. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!",,Bad,Bad
"I know that restaurants are now known for quality food rather than fabulous buffets, but seriously the price of a good dinner is getting ridiculous and this restaurant was no different.  Even though I wasn't paying I was still astounded by the cost of everything from the appetizers to the sides, lets now mention the wine and drinks.  The food was good but $65 for lamb chops and I mean JUST lamb chops is ridiculous.  They were good but nothing unusual other then the sauce that they served it with which in my opinion (I am a Brit and have eaten lots of lamb) was to far fetch, nothing bets a good mint sauce.  The other issue I had was the length of the dinner.  There was only one dedicated server, lots of bus people who whisked away your plate before you had time to savour the food, so there was long gaps between courses so dinner took over 3 1/2hrs!!! I was so done by the time I was finished.  Just another expensive restaurant to me, sadly I could have bought an entire cow for the cost of some of the beef and certainly if I had picked up the tab, needed a second mortgage.",Bad,,Bad
All the restaurants were great in the Aria. This was one of my favorites. The steak was so tender and worth every bite.,Good,,
"We had a wonderful dinner at Jean Georges. First and most importantly, the steaks were perfectly cooked, something that many places seem to get wrong. My medium was text book perfect. We also had the trumpet mushrooms and they were simply the best mushrooms we have ever had. I don‚Äôt know what they did to make them so amazing, but we could not stop eating them.  Bread was to die for, and service was on the mark and not fussy or stuffy. Prices are as you would expect from a premier Vegas steakhouse but it was a delightful evening.",Good,Good,Good
"The attention to detail by the staff was on point, never missed a beat. And the Steak! The best Rib-eye steak I have ever tasted!  EXCELLENT!! I enjoyed every bite! They say, you get what you pay for.. Well, this is exactly right at Jean Georges Steakhouse!  Plenty of space and great atmosphere. Make a reservation. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!",Good,Good,Good
"Rich flavors abound at Jean George Steakhouse.In addition to fine steaks,  be sure to get the pineapple shrimp as an appetizer.",Good,,
"i visited this restaurant in August 2018 and although it was the most expensive restaurant that i went to in Las Vegas, the decoration, atmosphere, staff, service and food were all excellent, and i even visited Gordan Ramseys Hells Kitchen restaurant while i was out there. 
the food was absolutely beautiful and changed my previous opinion that one steak is like any other.


the only downside for me which stopped this from being excellent all over was that the prices were so high!",Good,Good,Good
"If you are in town, please book this one 
It is amazing, incredible, fantastic service and the food is beyond expectations 
I‚Äôve tried the steaks , all are excellent, the fancy one is a bit too fatty for me , but is melting in ones  mouth . There is nothing I didn‚Äôt like here ..",Good,,Good
"I was alone so i decided to seat at the bar.
The bar man was experienced and polite 
I had a steak with fries and a glass of wine 
Everything was really good 
Really enjoyed it although it is expensive",Good,Good,Good
"With a plethora of options in Las Vegas, it can be difficult to find a truly great steakhouse that will surpass all expectations. I have tried many steakhouses all over the US. My wife and I are big foodies, and being in the hospitality industry myself I tend to have high standards for for I would consider ‚Äúexceptional‚Äù. There are only a couple places I‚Äôve ever been I would consider to have exceptional service, or exceptional food. Jean Georges has both. The first time I went here last year was for my birthday, and they didn‚Äôt disappoint. I had done a lot of research and decided on Jean Georges, and was glad I did. Knowing that any place can get lucky once, I still had high expectations as I returned with my wife for our anniversary. Not only did they not disappoint, they far exceeded my already high expectations. We felt like royalty from start to finish. The GM came over to wish us a happy anniversary and check on us. He was kind and engaged enough to personally ask for allergies and on top of that, asked for my wife‚Äôs dessert preferences. 


Service: We had Ramon and Rachael for our servers, and both were amazing! extremely attentive, gave great recommendations, very knowledgeable about the menu, and truly cared about making our experience a great one. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about them, thank you!!! 


The Food and drinks: on their recommendation, I tried an Eagle bourbon on the rocks.  Very good and smooth. My wife had a special, the belichi raspberry Bellini whisk she enjoyed. We had the tuna tartare to start, and it was very good. Not too big or filling, but tasted fresh and looked like it was made with care. For entrees, I had the bone in ribeye and my wife had the Chilean sea bass. I‚Äôm a big steak fan, so order steak a lot. This was without a doubt the best steak I‚Äôve ever had. It was so flavorful and had a perfect char on the perfect medium rare. To not only have the high end steak, but to have it cooked absolutely perfectly just made for a taste that‚Äôs hard to imagine. The I tried my wife‚Äôs Chilean sea bass as well, and we both agreed it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. You would think it was fresh off the boat, not eating it in the middle of a desert. If possible, the truffle Mac and cheese was just as good. The saut√©ed spinach and hand cut fries were good, and at a normal steakhouse I might say they were excellent, but here, in comparison to everything else, they were just fine. Not bad, but not exceptional. If I‚Äôm getting nit picky, I might recommend having a garlic or herb aioli, to go with them, or some type of parmesan truffle fry as a side, as opposed to just plain with ketchup. But again, they were cooked well and very good, just not as exceptional as the rest of the meal. 


Dessert was made special by the chef for our anniversary and was just as good as the exceptional meal. We had the chocolate lava cake and Carmel apple pie with maple pecan and vanilla bean ice cream. It was incredible! I was already stuffed, but had to eat dessert just because it might have been one of the best desserts I‚Äôve ever had. 


Overall- 5 stars is not enough. No I don‚Äôt work here, have no financial interest in this place. It just truly deserves an exceptional review for the exceptional place it is. Our experience was just incredible. Service, atmosphere, and food. Yes it is more on the expensive side, but it is well worth it. I live in Boston now, and we have some great steakhouses in Boston and NY, but nothing that compares to this (in my humble opinion). I would save up and fly back to Vegas just for this restaurant. Will definitely be returning. Thank you!!! Special thanks to the chef and GM. You truly helped make our anniversary a great one and exceeded our already high expectations!!",Good,Good,Good
"4 adults and 1 child (3 years) went for a meal with high expectations. 
Prices are high so we were expecting quite a lot. 
First conclusion: Not a restaurant expecting children. No childrens menu but flexible service compensated somehow for that. 
Great stakes and REALLY GOOD halibut. 
Service OK but we found ourselves a bit alone as most other tables were conference delegates with deeper pockets than ours :-)
Coming from the gastro capital Copenhagen we would expect more value for the money we spent considering the fact that the staff is expecting 15-20% in gratituity which is a stupid American phenomena. 
I know we are ‚Äúexpected‚Äù to pay this sort if ‚Äúsalary‚Äù in all restaurants in the US so it‚Äôs not really criticism of JG Steakhouse but 15-20% is way more in this restaurant than in Loris Diner :-)
Not sure if we will retur even though the food was great.",Good,,Good
"We reserved the Chef‚Äôs Table for a wedding party dinner of 14 people August 1st. It was a fabulous meal. The guests are still raving about the meal. The Wagyu Carpaccio was our appetizer, and was so delicious. I had the Burratta Mozzarella for my salad course - the mozzarella melted in my mouth. The steaks were moist and juicy, and desserts were tasty too. This is one of the best meals I have ever had at a restaurant. Our service was timely and the servers were very friendly. Their suggestions for our champagne and wines were right on.  The prices are on the high end, but worth every penny. It was a beautiful place to celebrate.",Good,Good,Good
"I always eat at the bar; the bartenders are awesome and always welcoming. The food is phenomenal. The 18 oz rib eye with all the sauces is amazing, as is the Caesar salad, which is a 'real Caesar'. I always have the salted baked potato with all of the 'fixings'.
Overall this is my favourite meal in Vegas!!",Good,Good,Good
"Great steakhouse with premium cuts of beef.  If you are looking for a place to take customers during a conference or just a nice night out, this is a great option.  The service is outstanding and the team there goes out of it's way to ensure you have a memorable night.  Worth the price.",Good,Good,Good
"We came here on the first night of the trip to Vegas.  What more can I say about it other than awesome?  The steaks were absolutely fantastic, and they also have an excellent range of wines.  I would happily recommend this place to anyone staying in Vegas, looking for a good steak, with Good in a nice setting.",Good,Good,Good
"I've been coming here since JG opened.  Their bone in rib-eye is prob the best in town!!.  And with a side of those mushrooms!!  One of the best meals in Vegas.  
Darren the bartender is great too!  Offers great service and always happen when you've returned to JG.  Prices are high, but I love it here!",Good,,Good
"We were excited at the promise of this restaurant but left feeling pretty underwhelmed. While there were spots of decent service and clearly there are a few professionals who work here, there are also many folks on the staff that don‚Äôt appear to have fine dining experience. We felt that the service was adequate but nowhere near what it should‚Äôve been  given the price points. You are still in Vegas in a casino and so unfortunately this still feels a little bit like a mass market steakhouse but honestly I‚Äôve had much better meals at places like the Capital Grille. The food was very delayed which they apologized for and offered an assortment of desserts to compensate. While I appreciated the desserts it was an inadequate gesture for a very long delay and otherwise mediocre steaks. The wine steward was immature, unhelpful and misinformed. I‚Äôm normally pretty gracious when I think perhaps a restaurant just had an off night but there was enough that added up to a mediocre experience here and it was considerably overpriced for the quality of the experience and the food so I won‚Äôt be back. I eat at a lot of fine dining restaurants and I‚Äôve been to steak houses in cities all over the country traveling for business so perhaps my bar is higher than your average Vegas tourist but this just isn‚Äôt the kind of place that‚Äôs worth the money or time.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This restaurant was beautifully decorated with lovely tables and fancy decor. Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly. However the food was average. I've been to plenty of mid-range and fine dining steakhouses and this one was so disappointing specifically because of their sky-high prices. We spent $200, and we did not have any drinks (only flat water) or any dessert. We ordered two filets and two appetizers. The appetizers were the fried calamari and the shrimp cocktail, both were pretty good but those steaks were just so disappointing. Frankly, I was pissed off that I paid so much for something that I couldve made better myself. No flavor, as if they didnt season with any salt/pepper. it was just bland. Never again. We warned our friends who were there with us not to waste their money, they went to STK in the cosmo instead.",Bad,Good,Good
"Jean Georges is one of my favorite steakhouses in Vegas..actually its the only steakhouse I go to when I'm in Vegas.  It never disappoints.  I'm in Vegas frequently for business - one trip has me there for a week, and I make a point to visit JG twice in that week.  The steaks are by far the best I've had - the food in general is incredible. 
The service is impeccable.  I would highly recommend JG to just about anyone - any group or a romantic dinner.",Good,Good,Good
Went for dinner for 3 on Sunday night.  Resturant was busy but had no trouble getting reservations. Bar decor nice and Resturant large but spaced so not so loud and easy to carry on a conversation. Prices a bit high. Sushi appetizer superb   Entrees average size so you do not get stuffed feeling.  Wine list extensive.  Would definitely eat there again,Good,Good,
"Ambiance in this place is incredible. Food is superb. Steaks, appetizers, sides... all wonderfully prepared. So flavorful and everything made to perfection. We wound up here as the result of a Thanksgiving Dinner reservation issue at another restaurant. Now we are thinking of making this our Thanksgiving tradition.",Good,Good,
"My husband had a great birthday dinner! Great food, service, and ambiance. We had a great experience. I would recommend highly however it is a little pricey. Located inside the Aria hotel so we couldn't complain it was literally upstairs from our room.",Good,Good,Good
"Excellent service !!!!!!!!! Reservations highly recommended. Here for my Birthday. The Black Truffle Mac and Cheese was Fabulous with ribeye steak. Great Beef cuts, quality, tender, and melt in your mouth. Hubby enjoy BBQ ribs, octopus, and Wagyu something. The bread with the butter/garlic was served warm. So delicious. My hubby after the fact wish we got a small treat since it was my Birthday but the memory still leaves a smile on my face. We were very pleased with our experience. It's located in the ARIA. High Eats and worth it. Looking forward to returning back once we visit Vegas again.",Good,Good,Good
"Intimate beautiful dining decor, outstanding servers (Seana, Israel, and John), decadent and delicious food and their homemade bread makes this restaurant SPECTACULAR!


Kudos to all of the attention to detail!  Thank you for a perfect dinner and wonderful memories.  See you soon!",Good,Good,Good
"Stayed at the Aria Hotel earlier this year and had a wonderful dinner here at Jean Georges! The carpaccio was heavenly. Service was on point, efficient and gracious without being pandering.  Steaks were cooked to perfect medium rare as ordered. Excellent, well laid out wine list with viable options for any taste. Room was dimly lit but with well positioned lighting so one did not have strain to see the menu. Decor was refined with an artistic touch. Price point certainly makes this a special occasion restaurant but well worth the cost.",Good,Good,Good
"July 1 , 10pm reservation. For our appetizers we ordered the wagyu carpacio & the octopus. The carpacio dish had good flavors , although unconventional to the style of carpacio we are used to & the octopus was mediocre at best . We also had the wedge salad which was subpar to most wedge salads we‚Äôve had in the past . For entrees we had the bone in filet or chateau-briand (misspell I‚Äôm sure) & the whole lobster tail , almost $400 combined for these two items alone ! The bone in filet was carved table side & after the first few cuts we could tell it was cooked very unevenly , extremely dry on the outside & some of the inside was undercooked . As if that wasn‚Äôt bad enough , the steak lacked flavor & tasted like very low quality meat , kinda makes sense now that they bring 5 different sauces for the meat ; a good steak needs no sauce ! The lobster tail tasted pretty good but arrived at the table cold . We also had an accompanying dish of foie gras , it was good . For sides, we had the creamed spinach & the truffled mashed potatoes, both were ok but not what one would expect at what is supposed to be a high end restaurant  . Additionally , we overheard complaints from the table in back of one of their steaks arriving an hour after ordering it & to make matters worse their 2nd steak arrived 15 minutes after that , surprising since they weren‚Äôt busy at all . As for the service at our table , we have no complaints. Maybe Jean Georges was just having an off night or maybe the chef called in sick & one of the waiters replaced him , either way we will never return .",Bad,Bad,Good
Me and friends ate at 3 different high-end steak houses last weekend and I would have to say that Jean George was the best.  The grilled octopus and tempura calamari starters were both excellent.  I splurged on the A5 and was not disappointed.  A nice selection of wines by the glass and service overall was timely and attentive.  This is an extremely convenient place to get a great steak if you are staying at Aria Sky Suites.,Good,Good,Good
"I ordered the filet cooked medium and it came out more medium plus and medium well on the outside. The waiter did offer to remake but I declined because I filled up on their yummy
Mashed potatoes and mushrooms. Aides are big enough to share with 3-4. The bread was AMAZING and that herb butter was spectacular. I‚Äôd give this another try if they make my steak to order!",Good,,
"We ended up at Jean Georges after another restaurant completely dropped the ball for my husband's 50th dinner.  I can't say I'm sorry that happened now, because the dinner and service we received at Jean Georges was extraordinary!  Every course got better and better.  The steaks were cooked perfectly, the sides were large, shareable and delicious, and the service was perfect.  


A huge shout out to Joe, the Asst. Manager who took the time on a busy night to come over and chat with us about our experience.  You and your team ended up saving the night for us!  We will absolutely be back the next time we are in town.",Good,Good,Good
We stopped by for some apps before our table was ready at Carbone it was delicious and we will defiantly be back for dinner. The bone marrow was amazing.,Good,,
The restaurant is nice and comfortable and the wait staff is cordial. Ordered the Chilean sea bass. Awesome. The 14 dollar baked potato was overcooked and sent back. My wife's $45 salmon was half raw. Watched 2 other orders sent back raw. Told the wait staff. Did not do anything about it. Of course we paid for it but this was a trial for our company party and obviously they failed. Go somewhere else.,Bad,Good,Bad
"Vegas is loaded with steak houses to be sure.  This one is convenient in the hotel and was a great meal.  Not sure this one stands out over any of the other good ones, but for sure you are getting a great steak prepared as it should be.   Wine list was good and the sommelier was very helpful narrowing down based on my budget and asks.  Over all I'd go back if I was at the Aria again.",Good,,
"I visited Jean Georges Steakhouse with a colleague on my recent trip to Vegas.  It was with some apprehension that I did so, as I am not a big meat eater and I find that meals at these hyped restaurants are usually a disappointment.  I was completely mistaken about JG.  It was great.  And, everything about it was terrific.  I settled on classic steakhouse selections: shrimp cocktail and lamb chops.  The shrimp cocktail was comprised of 5 crunchy jumbo shrimp accompanied by a great sauce.  And, my lamb chops were cooked medium rare as ordered.  It was a large order of 4 double rib chops that were accompanied by a wonderful lamb reduction sauce flavored with mint and other spices.  They were just sensational and accompanied by sides of delicious mashed potatoes and spinach.   I opted to skip dessert as I was completely satiated by the meat (with leftovers.) but based upon the other dishes that I had, I wished I had saved room for it.  I would return there any time in the future that I am in Las Vegas.",Good,,
I ate last week with my invited guests at Jean George. Restaurant was the choice of my guests. It was my first time eating at Jean George. I asked for no salt on mine and my husbands food. I ordered the Rib eye Medium Rare and my husband had the Veal Chop Medium.  My steak came salty as could be and my husbands Veal Chop was pretty Medium Rare but not salty I asked the waiter for another Rib Eye it also came salty and Medium so I just didn't eat it and my husband ate half of the veal chop to rare. I did not want to complain in front of my 3 guests so I let it go. The waiter or manager should have seen that the steak was not eaten or that the Veal chop was pink when taking it off the table and ask was anything wrong. I paid the bill I thought at least they should have taken off the rib eye they didn't my husband paid and we left very dissatisfied. I eat at all the restaurants at the Aria and I was never as disappointed as Jean George.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"One of the best steaks I've had in a while. Sides were also very, very good. Great ambiance and excellent service made this a memorable dinner. The prices are on the high side, as you would expect for a quality steakhouse on the Las Vegas strip, but you get what you pay for here.",Good,Good,Good
"This was our second time eating here.  The first time I ordered a steak that was great, this time I had lamb chops which were really good, and big.  The side options are so good.",Good,,
"Highest quality of food, design and service!  
We visited the restaurant on our last day in Vegas, and this night made everything just unforgettable.",Good,Good,Good
"This was my first time at this restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised by the very attentive sevice and excellent menu. The cocktails are also very good. This is an upsce restaurant so it is pricey, but a great choice to treat yourself wheb you visit Vegas.",Good,Good,Good
"FABULOUS in every way!!! Food, service & atmosphere wonderful... Jason & Nate were awesome!! Can‚Äôt wait for the next time! Hubby had lamb, I had Wagyu fillet ... split their incredible salt rubbed potato, shrimp cocktail and beet salad... PERFECT‚ù§Ô∏è",Good,Good,Good
"This is an excellent restaurant.  Even though we sat at the bar; our waiter was first class.  The food was beyond excellent and the portion size perfect.  I can't even begin to describe the taste of the food; the only one that comes to mind is ""mouth watering"".  It is expensive but worth every penny and then some.  Try it out if you ever get the chance. Remember though, if you want a table make a reservation; but sitting at the bar is just as good.",Good,Good,Good
"Seriously people! We have no idea how this place is given any kind of a good reputation for steaks???!!! Did we just by chance go on their worst ever supply of beef? But that doesn‚Äôt explain the BLANDNESS of the flavor! Everything else was exceptional, wait staff, the sea bass, the sides..... but jeeeeez NOT THE BEEF!",Bad,,Good
"The food and service was great! Servers were knowledgeable and very helpful in helping us decide on food choices. 


My only negative feedback about this restaurant is regarding their photographer. Not sure if she worked with the restaurant or if she was on her own. She got rude when we declined to buy the photos she took of us and then stormed off. Either way, that level of professionalism is unacceptable. Just because photos were taken doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm obligated to buy them, especially if they weren‚Äôt up to my standards.",Good,Bad,Good
"wait staff was nice and paid attention.  nice looking restaurant.  Good menu.  A bit pricey compared to portion sizes.  They do serve prime steak - which is only way to go. Plus they have higher end waygu if you want that.  They don't mess around.  A nice cocktail. 
Steak was cooked perfectly. Dessert was decadent.  One of the better places in Vegas for steak. NIce bar area with TV's.  Dress is casual to business casual. In Aria hotel. Had enjoyable time.",Good,Good,Good
Went here for our wedding celebration meal. I had the bone in rib eye and my partner had the salmon. Both cooked to perfection. Lovely restaurant and service was spot on.,Good,Good,Good
"When in Vegas you have a lot of great choices for hotels and dining. If you are staying at the Aria or not, you should definitely dine at Jean George‚Äôs Steak House. Steaks,fish or seafood you will enjoy your delicious meal. The wait staff was great also.",Good,,Good
"Right off the bat the atmosphere was perfect for an anniversary occasion by being dimly lit. Service was excellent and they catered to all our needs. Quality of meats and sides were superb!  They gave us a ""free"" anniversary dessert. Now, it is expensive and to be expected here, but was worth every penny!",Good,Good,Good
We were early for our reservation and we weren't dress the best. Nothing bad just not nice slacks etc. They took us right in to our table and said we looked just fine. The d√©cor is just beautiful low lights candles etc. The food is why we come to this restaurant. I don't care what the price of the food is because it is so worth the experience of cutting your Filet with a fork. Yes with a fork. Lobster is always good. The staff always have a smile and treat you like your party is the only one in the restaurant. Enjoy,Good,Good,Good
This steak house the food was really good and the customer service was excellent. I really love how the service here was. they also have a really good wine selection . The best part was the butter bread they bring out before the course . Another appetizer that was excellent was the calamari. I love how elegant and beautiful the place was decorated and it had a very nice ambiance. I definitely recommend this place ...,Good,Good,Good
"We went to this restaurant during our first evening of our stay of there nights. All the food we ordered was great. A very good selection of wines, even the open wines that you can have by the glass. We were attended by Rachel. She was great. On our third evening, we returned asked to be waited by Rachel again. A second great experience, although we ordered different dishes. It is not cheap but worth every penny spent.",Good,Good,Good
"I had a short business trip to Las Vegas and of course wanted to get back to one of my favorite spots on the strip.  I didn't have time for a full dinner.  After meetings a colleague and I dropped in for appetizers and a drink.  We were greeted by Gerti Gjika, the assistant general manager, who was warm, welcoming and ushered us to a fine table.  Appetizers included carpaccio and sushi.  All flavorful and expertly presented.  


Whether you are an expert in whiskey or a beginner, the whiskey cart is a great experience!  Prices are very reasonable with a wide range.  You don't need to spend a fortune to try many options.  We had the Yamazaki 12 with the applewood smoke - a great whiskey plus the infused smoke is both a great presentation and flavor.  As a treat, we asked if they had the Van Winkle available.  Gerti went to another restaurant to obtain this rare offering - thank you for going the extra mile to maximize my experience!  I'm glad I tried the Van Winkle, it is expensive but amazingly lived up to the hype.  It is smooth.


Gerti - thank you for arranging a great experience on short notice!  You're the best!",Good,Good,Good
"We came here as a group of 5 and for the most part, we all enjoyed our meals. We were seated immediately and the service was great. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and lesson-learned (again) -- don't order seafood at a steakhouse. It was pretty good but a very small portion. Luckily one of my friends ordered the Wagyu Brisket which was absolutely enormous, and I had a good amount of leftovers that he couldn't finish.


One person in our group also noted that the Old Fashioned he ordered was barely drinkable. He drinks a lot of Old Fashioneds and he was just really shocked that the bar messed it up so badly. He didn't say anything during dinner though so we couldn't see if it was just a one-time issue or always made that way.


A photographer was also coming around taking pictures of the various tables -- I really liked ours and would have purchased if there wasn't a person standing in the background. Just something to look our for before getting photographed.


Overall, we had a pretty good dining experience!",Good,Good,Good
"The food was just incredible and the service staff was among the best ever. This restaurant is quite pricey, but for the quality of food, service and setting that should be expected.",Good,Good,Good
Second visit to Jean George. 16oz bone in New York very good. Lobster mashed potatoes also good. The best part of the meal for me is the different sauces. I really enjoyed the habenero based sauce. That said the miso base was great with everything ordered. It is spectacular.,Good,Good,
"The steak was top notch as was the service.  We booked last minute and needed to eat quickly.  We were seated, had starters and main and gone within the hour.  Worth a visit.",Good,Good,Good
I love this place. The menu has changed a bit since my last visit but it‚Äôs still amazing. The beef carpaccio is unusual and I love it. Definitely not the normal way it‚Äôs served. I shared a beef chateaubriand on the bone. It was amazing. You get a nice range of sauces which you can combine for some great flavours but to be honest the meat doesn‚Äôt need it. Sadly I didn‚Äôt have room for dessert.,Good,Good,
"I try to start every Las Vegas visit with an evening feast at JGS.  This month was no exception.  Usually a solo diner but this time my daughter and her boyfriend joined me.  I am now used to the culinary magic of Chef Sean Griffin but this a first time experience for both of them.  They were blown away.


They got to the restaurant before I did and we greeted and made welcome by Joon, the over the top manager that keeps everything running so smoothly.


We were lucky enough to have Reed as a server and he did not skip a beat all night all‚Äîand the 3 of us gave him a workout!


The food‚Äîveal, brisket, fish, and So many apps, salads, sides, desserts, and extras.  Every bite Perfect!


And a table visit by the most talented and humble Chef I know made this one for the books.


Do yourself a huge favor and experience the magic of Jean Georges Steakhouse in the Aria.",Good,Good,Good
This is a top favorite whenever we come to Vegas. Great food & service. The sea bass and filet are wonderful.  Bring back the pretzel bread!,Good,Good,Good
"The food was excellent, the beef carpaccio starter was a revelation, a different take on it and great in every way. The chateaubriand steak was excellent and well worth sharing. The sides were great - make sure you ask for more bread it‚Äôs so good and the mashed potatoes are excellent. Great wine selection to go with the meal and great advice from the serving team.",Good,,Good
Every year we go decide to try a different steak place. This years was worth a stop. Service was on their game. Food was very good make sure you get lobster mash potato,Good,,Good
"I guess most people eating here are only going once but it is a touch overpriced.


We had a decent meal. It was what you would expect though for such a restaurant inside a major resort property - food was delicious, no issues with our service, good wine, Strip prices, and yet nothing to really make it stand-out but for the price.",Good,,Good
"Everything was pretty good.  The food is about what you'd expect when you're paying a higher price for dinner.  Wasn't the best I've ever had and certainly wasn't the worst.  I enjoyed my oysters.  My steak was way overcooked but we had just flown in and I was starving so I ate it and it was delicious.  If I wasn't so hungry at the time of dinner my review probably would of been worse.  


Service was spotty.  Our waitress was outstanding and personable.  Our waiter seemed like he had better things to do.  At times our glasses went long periods without being filled while other times we felt rushed.  Very odd dining experience.  


I think when a restaurant charges high prices they are a bit under the microscope.  Rightfully so in my opinion.  I had the feeling while eating that it was one of those restaurants where 8 out of 10 people will say it's the best they've ever been to.  Where more often than not your food and service experience will be just fine.  And I think the restaurant is good with this.  I got the feeling that they didn't much care if a few people didn't like their meal because enough people do.  It's all a numbers game that's probably extremely profitable.  I fall into the 2 out of 10 category and I'd probably still go back.",Good,Bad,Bad
"I now JG¬¥s Restaurant in New York, Shanghai and Bahamas (at least 14 years ago I was there). This was my first visit in one of his steakhouses. Meat selection and quality perfect. Service very friendly and professional. Great selection of wines and perfect presentation of the steak and the sides dishes. Sure, not cheap but I had a great evening. Will be back !!!!",Good,Good,Good
"Visited here a few days ago as a friend wanted to try the A5 Kobe. $180 for a 3oz steak! As a one off I get it though and we knew it would cost that before we went, but my complaint isn‚Äôt strictly about the food. The steak was really nice. Not the best steak I‚Äôve ever had, both Gaucho in London and Gordon Ramsey Steak in Vegas we‚Äôre superior (except for the Kobe). The problems here are the service and price. With tip, it was over $1000 for 6 people with only 2 alcoholic drinks in that and the rest drinking water. On top of that, one ate a burger and another ate chicken. Still, over $1k and it certainly wasn‚Äôt worth that. Then there‚Äôs the service. I‚Äôm a slower eater than most, but the second the first person finished, the plate was whipped up from under them. Then the second person finished and within 15 seconds the plate was gone. This continued until it left just my plate on the table and still a little of my meal to eat. I felt rushed and they just wanted us out to flip the table again. With the amount we were paying, they should have wanted to keep us there! I didn‚Äôt feel cared for and felt they wanted us in and out in a flash. So to summarise, the food was good but not special and the service was not commendable at all.",Bad,,Bad
"Two adults and two teens, and with tip it was over $500.  We didn't order a lot of food, but when the cheapest steak is approaching $60, this will ad up quick.  The food itself was good, and the atmosphere was nice.  The servers were very friendly and nice, but were not the most responsive - just seemed maybe there weren't enough for the restaurant, and there seemed to be some larger groups they were catering too.  I'd give it a 4 with better service, and a 5 if the prices were slightly less.  The food itself was all very good.",Good,Good,Good
"At this time the most popular Restaurant request amongst out-of-town guests, even those infrequently dining on Red Meat compelled to visit by a wide range of Appetizers, Salads, Entrees and Sides, it was as a party of eight that dinner was enjoyed at Jean Georges Steakhouse on Friday evening, a five course meal large enough to feed twelve once again leaving several diners speechless and the rest already planning a return visit. 


Still the longest tenured Restaurant on Aria‚Äôs star-studded second floor, Chef Vongerichten occasionally  paying a visit but the menu and day-to-day cooking left to the talented Sean Griffin, it was just prior to a 6:30pm reservation that guests were  seated in a rounded booth where Beverages and Bread were served quickly, the Prix-Fixe Menu beginning with eight signature Wagyu and Truffle Gougeres plus a fully loaded Shellfish Tower featuring plump Gulf Shrimp and Lobster Tails plus Crab Legs as thick as some adult women‚Äôs  forearms.


Not yet turning the page from Winter to Spring, though subtle changes and seasonal Produce have persistently allowed  Chef Griffin to customize a menu even for a table of Vegans, it was with the last few Oysters and Clams slurped from their Shells that a trio of Salads next landed  in duplicate,  Jean-Georges signature Heirloom Tomatoes with Hearts of Palm not losing a bit of its freshness during colder months while the chopped Wedge and the new Spring Salad with Peas and Avocado shined thanks to its various textures and herbaceous Green Goddess.


Matching high prices with larger than average portions, the $15 Bone Marrow always a jaw-dropper as it is served whole with Parsley Salad a la St. John, course three additionally presented two plates of Crunchy Organic Chicken that remains unparalleled even in Restaurants that specialize in fried Bird, the Tempura Batter standing at least a quarter inch off the Skin and delicious on its own but even better when paired bite-for-bite with saut√©ed Spinach soaked in Butter and Hot Sauce. 
 
Certainly not forgetting the Beef, everything from USDA Prime to certified A5 Wagyu available at a price, it was on a large tableside cart that Wagyu Brisket and a 42oz Tomahawk were sliced and served along with a sizable Dry-Aged Strip Steak, each prized by a different part of the table with a former ‚Äúwell-done‚Äù Midwesterner  particularly praiseful of the Medium-Rare Meat from Mishima Ranch while others marveled at the full flavored Strip and Brisket that was not merely fork, but spoon tender.
 
Complimenting Beef with Sides, the Steakhouse‚Äôs signature Crunchy Potatoes and buttery pureed Spuds with Black Truffles both as good as usual, those looking for something more seasonal may wish to turn their attention to simple Grilled Asparagus or elegant Pea and Carrot dishes while those who simply cannot get enough Meat are invited to dress up their Steaks with seared Foie Gras, grilled Salt Water Prawns or Scallops currently offered atop Polenta with Bok Choy, Peppers and Bacon.


Rounding out the evening with a platter featuring all five of the Restaurant‚Äôs current Desserts, none new but all novel to seven first-timers, suspicions were confirmed that those who enjoy Passionfruit were particularly taken by the Gold Bar while the Market Apple Pie, Cheesecake and Salted Caramel Sundae all had their fans with not one bit of any returning to the kitchen despite many saying they were ‚Äútoo full‚Äù for Dessert before the wooden board‚Äôs arrival.


FIVE STARS:  Although some may wish to argue the merits of Luger‚Äôs or Bern‚Äôs nationally and Carnevino or CUT locally there is really no comparing any American Steakhouse to what Sean Griffin and his team at Jean Georges Steakhouse have been rolling out since last year‚Äôs renovation, everything from the service pieces to Meats and Produce upgraded from an already fine baseline to a level that defines world-class.",Good,Good,
"I was really looking forward to this meal with a good friend. Dinner started with an amazing bottle of Kenzo Estate. Sadly, it went downhill from there. 


We ordered Tuna Tartar, fries and Calamari as apps. The two that are cooked showed up cold. Our waiter Eddie, who was excellent, took care of replacing the dishes for us. 


I ordered the 8 oz NZ filet, Oscar style. It arrived cold as well. I didn‚Äôt bother with a refire. It would have been an excellent steak had it been hot. I just didn‚Äôt want to deal with sending it back as well. 


I never expected these kind of execution issues at a restaurant of this caliber.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Quite the steak house! I was shocked by the price but realized the value in perfect food and excellent service. The noise level was a little too much. service was friendly and professional. Overall a great experience.,Good,Good,Good
"This was my second experience at Jean Georges and it lived up to the first trip!  


I had the filet mignon and it was prepared perfectly to my liking.  The mashed potato and asparagus sides were wonderful.  Dessert was an exceptional apple pie.


The wine selection for dinner was an excellent cabernet sauvignon.  Truly exceptional was the Yamazaki 12 year old scotch after dinner.  This is a difficult to locate bottle but when our table discussed trying it, the bar captain promptly produced a bottle.  It was an exquisite taste and experience all around.",Good,Good,
"First of all, I personally phoned the restaurant twice to tell them we were celebrating my wife's bday and our anniversary.  When we arrived, we sat at the bar and found that there was only one bottle of red on the extensive wine list under $100!  We got around to ordering and my wife told the server she wanted her fish extra well done.  I ordered my steak med rare.  The fish came medium, and my steak was rare. Throughout the meal, no mention of her bday or our anniversary. We passed on the dessert and the check came.  Nothing.  I asked for the manager and told him how disappointed we were on the entire experience and that no one ever mentioned our anniversary or her bday.  I thought for sure he would at least offer to take something off the bill, and all he did was give us his business card and said to ask for him next time we come in.  He did send a celebratory dessert over.  Too many options in Vegas to ever go back and we won't.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The food was phenomenal - I especially loved all the vegetable options like the beet salad, brussel-sprouts, and asparagus. The apple pie was my favorite from the dessert menu and I enjoyed it with a delicious cup of coffee. Service was superb.",Good,,Good
"We originally tried to get a reservation at Blossom but it conflicted with our Zumanity show. Long story short- We had to wait even though we had a reservation & then the hostess tried to sit us in this ""punishment time out"" section completely separated from other diners & rather lonely. We immediately told her no we would prefer to sit amongst the rest of the guests on the other side of the restaurant so that set the tone for the remainder. Once we got to a WAY better located table, we ordered. The photographer was nice but tried to turn it into a photo shoot & I really just wanted to chill with my friend & converse. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass & my friend ordered the Waygu filet. This was my first Chilean Sea Bass so I was extra excited because Jean George is a world-renowned chef so I know his food would be. The wait for the food was an approx. hour which I found odd. Once we got the food, I could not break the fish a part with my fork; I needed a knife, nay, a steak knife. I took the bite & it was the rubberiest piece of fish I've had to date & because I am a textural eater, I could not swallow it. It was terrible. My friend's filet was overly salty. I went to the restroom to spit the fish out of my mouth. I tried her filet & it literally tasted like a bite of pure sea salt. The managers took the dishes away & apologized. I cannot leave a good review for this steakhouse. It was disgusting. The ambiance & d√©cor on the other hand were absolutely gorgeous.",Bad,Good,Bad
"We got exactly what we were expecting, ‚Äúa great steak‚Äù! However my associate ordered the cod, not something that I‚Äôd ever suggest in a steakhouse, and was nice enough to give me a taste. I then spent the balance of our meal wishing that I‚Äôd ordered the fish. It was amazing. Definitely a go back place.",Good,,
"Short rib entree was excellent. Calamari appetizer was tough and too chewy. Their gold bar dessert was not great, the apricot in it tasted odd. Should have went with the tomahawk ribeye. Very loud, noisy restaurant, I actually had to switch my seat  mid meal, the table next to me was so loud and boisterous. I'm not sure I would come back, it is pricy, not worth the hundred dollar bill for one without drinking.",Good,Bad,
Thought we would try this steak house as a special treat  Wow what a mistake  The steak a new York cut ordered medium rare came very overcooked for both of us. It was duly returned and a fresh complete course was brought to the table. Although better cooked the steak was not very favourable and not as tender as one might expect  I ordered the side of lobster mashed potatoes for a ridiculous price of $20 and these to were not very tasteful. A couple of small pieces of lobster and what seemed like the lobster water  Not a great meal after such high expectations,Bad,Bad,
"I recommend sharing a few different dishes family style. The filet was great, but the octopus was not as good as expected. Great service and atmosphere.",Good,Good,Good
"There was 6 of us who were in Vegas for a few nights. Our last night we decided to visit this restaurant, the waitress was very knowledgeable and fun. They were able to accommodate a gluten allergy and made sure we all got something we enjoyed. This is not a cheap option for eating out as your protein doesn‚Äôt include any sides but we enjoyed a lot of the options.",Good,,Good
"Had drinks and extensive appetizers with coworkers here. The waitstaff were super attentive, and the food was really awesome. I assume that dinner would be equally as good, and our friends who live in Las Vegas say that this is their favorite place for dinner.",Good,Good,Good
"The restaurant was half full when my friend and I arrived so no complaints at the speed of service nor their attitudes. In fact the servers were very pleasant. I knew that we were in for an expensive meal so no complaints there or else I simply would not have gone there. My complaint is the overall presentation of the meal by the so called chef working there that evening. Mind you it could have been the restaurant owner's policy of how it's done. Totally horrible. A white plate with an 8oz steak in the middle of it. That's it!!! There was a very small receptacle the size of a shot glass with a green dressing in it. Neither of us liked the taste so it remained untouched. The side order of fries were in a separate tiny bowl. The server said that we would be fine by splitting a single side order of fries. That was a mistake. We each got about 10 to 12 fries each. The lighting in the restaurant was very low making the entire place dark to the point that the ambiance created wasn't a pleasant one. The wine was excellent, pricy but again I knew that going in so no issues with that. With so much emphasis placed on food presentation and taste on so many of these Food Network television shows, I think that if someone from one of these shows were to rate this restaurant outing, they would most likely have harsher words to say.",Bad,Good,Good
"nice restaurant in aria hotel, not overcrowded and gives a little privacy to talk. food was excellent and they have an extensive wine list.",Good,Good,
"We came with a large group and they were more than accommodating.  We also ordered almost the whole menu and everything I tried was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing!  Service was excellent even though it took some time to get our meals out, we had lots of appetizers and drinks so it didn‚Äôt bother us. Really cool restaurant and huge wine selection.  You‚Äôll spend some money for sure but it was worth it!",Good,Good,Good
"Have eaten here twice, and the food and service were both very good both times.  This time, however, the place was packed, and my wife and I were forced to yell to hear each other.  Not really the atmosphere we're looking for at these prices, but then again, it is Vegas.",Good,Good,Good
Really great meal. The service and decor/ambiance are great. It's not cheap though! But a really nice experience and all the food is really good. If you can afford it it's worth checking out for sure. Steaks are great but nice seafood and sides too!,Good,Good,Good
"I did not know it was a steak house, but they have large menu that you choose from that is not typical steak house menu..
We started with Calamari Tempura with a dipping  Sriracha sauce that was delicious! We also order the Grilled Octopus and it was nice and soft with perfect seasoning.we also ordered the sea bass with miso and the grilled lobster. 
The space is very nice and can hold large groups because of the layout.
Great service very professional.",Good,Good,Good
We were seated in the back of the restaurant next to the wait prep are so not a great start. The rest was very good. Very knowledge wait staff and food was done very well. Steaks were cooked to our liking and a good selection. Great wine list. The bread that is brought to the table is outstanding. Very good dessert selection including a good bar. Prime Steakhouse in the Bellagio is Cheft Jean George's as well. The menus are very similar. If I had to choose I would go with prime to add the atmosphere experience.,Good,Good,Good
"I go on an annual ""steakcation"" with my friends to Vegas and we try to hit up all of the steakhouses in town. This year, we tried Jean Georges and we will most certainly be back. We were seated quickly on a Friday night. It is a darker space with some modern music playing throughout. The space is clean and modern, but has a dark steakhouse feel to it. One look at the menu and we knew that we were going to be in trouble because everything looked amazing. I had the garlic shrimp appetizer and I nearly licked the plate clean, the sauce was so good. Our waiter was helpful in guiding us through the menu and offering suggestions. I ended up splitting a Tomahawk Ribeye with my friend and it was prepared perfectly. A nice flavor with some good, but not overwhelming seasoning. The brussel sprouts and truffle mash were super good. near the end of the meal, we all decided it was so good that we ordered a New York Strip to share between the four of us. Not more than 5 minutes later another perfectly cooked steak appeared and we continued to gorge. Then for good measure we ordered dessert- the JG 24K Gold Bar (basically hazelnut mouse and some passion fruit) and a molten chocolate cake. Each were very tasty. We will certainly be back.",Good,Good,Good
"Food was great! Husband is very picky eater and he loved his filet mignon! Mashed potatoes where amazing, definitely reserve!",Good,,
typical steakhouse as far as menu but above the cut as far as quality. Steaks are great cooked to your liking. good selection of sides with truffle mashed my favorite. The highlight though a wagyu carpaccio out of this world.,Good,,
"This steakhouse is located in the Aria hotel and casino. One of many fine restaurants they feature here. We had a fantastic experience and the server took excellent care of us. For appetizers we had the raw oysters, beef tartare, tuna tartare and beet salad. All were expertly prepared and delicious. For our entrees we split a porterhouse with 4 tasty sauces and truffle Mac n cheese. But what really blew us away was the bone marrow. The bones were huge, the marrow was plentiful, and they were roasted perfectly. Instead of spreading the marrow on the bread we scooped it out and put it on the porterhouse steak. Unbelievable!!!",Good,Good,Good
"Was very excited to eat here, but the experience was far less exciting than the bill warranted. 


Medium-rare chateau briand was RARE and bland. Pepper prawns ok, but 3 for $26? Even the deserts were child sized. I wouldn‚Äôt of minded the small portions nearly as much if they weren‚Äôt so exorbitantly expensive and bland.",Bad,Bad,
We had the waygu tomahawk for two. It was delicious and perfectly cooked. The service was better than expected.,Good,,Good
"Alongside my juicy and delicious 100% grass fed NZ fillet, I can recommend the wasabi mash and beautiful fresh asparagus. I favorably remember the tuna ceviche and bread as well. There was definitely a consensus around our table of six that the food was superb. 


Wine selection was impressive, and the service was efficient and friendly. Amongst us was a colleague who was short in time and the restaurant ensured we all had a wonderful full meal together! 


Very much enjoyed the whole experience. Will recommend to any colleague traveling in Vegas to stop by this great restaurant.",Good,Good,Good
"After having a great steak the previous night, was a bit disappointed with Jean Georges. Ordered a filet and it was just OK. The taste was good, but a bit tough to get through. The side dishes were very small considering they were to be shared. Over all, value for the price was not there.",Bad,,
"As a Vegas veteran, I've been loyal to the fine folks at Wolfgang Puck's ""CUT."" Still, staying at Aria recently, we decided to give Jean-Gorges a try. We were blown away with the meal. 


We started with the beef carpaccio. It was my first time with this dish, recommended by the server. It was melt in your mouth beef served just the right way. 


We continued with their signature ribeye. We had mac and cheese as a side and a couple of cocktails. The steak was one of the best I've had in Vegas. It was tender and flavorful. I've had problems at other Vegas steakhouses (looking at you, Prime) with properly booking meat, but JG did medium rare the right way. I wouldn't have changed a thing. It was one of those meals where I looked at my buddy and we both were just making noises while eating. Not much was said other than ""wow"" when we left. 


JG is not cheap, but it's a worthy experience. The service was good, we felt comfortable, and the food lived up to expectations. I have my bachelor party in Vegas in March, and a group of us will be back at JG for a special night. 


Thanks to all.",Good,Good,Good
"When i go to Las Vegas I always stay at the Aria, partly because of this place. Im almost always traveling solo and having this place in my hotel is a blessing. I've only sat at the bar so i cant speak to the dining room but I have always had exceptional service. Im a BIG eater and drinker (especially when I'm traveling alone) and usually have an appetizer or 2, a steak (add the bone marrow)  and a side... then a dessert,,, after a few more glasses of wine of course. Obviously im used to racking up the bill but at JG's it was surprisingly reasonable. I dont think they're on the menu anymore but the beef carpaccio with truffle fritters was a good enough reason to fly out to LV on its own! Luckily there is enough on the menu that even when i came 4 nights in a row i never got the same thing twice (except that bone marrow)! The steaks all come with an assortment of tasty sauces, but the quality of meat here is so good you honestly don't need them (although the Bearnaise and the hot sauces are truly special) Cocktails are also on point btw! (seriously though, get the bone marrow) 
Will be back at the Aria in February and definitely know where my first dinner will be!


did i remember to talk about the bone marrow? Get the bone marrow.",Good,Good,
"Let me start with that I‚Äôm an architect and professional heddonist. I‚Äôm very pretentious and detail oriented person. Unfortunatelly I see things other people don‚Äôt. 


So, will give you my comments about the stay devided by five categories: 
1. Service
2. Design
3. Food
4. Overall experiences


Service - 2/5
When he took our order, the waiter ruined my Zegna shirt with a blue pen. The only normal man was the somelier who offered the wines for us. All other guys were more than terrible. I drank San Pelegrino sparkling water and they mixed it 2 times with still water in my glass...


Design - 1/5
The restaurant is with redicilous layout. When you enter, the first thing you see is the toilet!! Tables are very close to each other and you don‚Äôt have any privacy. 
It‚Äôs overdarked and not cozy at all. 


Food - 1/5
Food was disgusting. Plenty of oil in the fishes and the steak wasn‚Äôt better than any steak on the street. As well the salads.


Overall experiences
Overpriced and overrated. 
Sorry, Jean George, but your restaurant here sucks.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This was maybe my 5th visit and I absolutely can‚Äôt wait to go back! I dream of the waygu carpaccio! I know others have said it‚Äôs pricey but order a few items from each course to share and there will be food leftover. My daughter and I even split a steak and it was just right amount.
Ive tried several steakhouses in Vegas and this one really is the best quality and price. 
I‚Äôll be back soon!",Good,Good,
We couldn‚Äôt decide upon a steakhouse and ultimately decided here because we were staying in aria sky suites. We were very happy we chose Jean Georges! The bread and butter was a perfect appetizer and not too filling. Raspberry Bellini was also great. A friend with us ordered the A5 Kobe beef and it was melt in your mouth delicious. I‚Äôve never had a filet quite like that one! However... the best meal hands down was the Waygu brisket!! Holy moly... to die for!!! Sooo tender and moist with the perfect about of fat and sauce on the side. I had the waygu filet and our other friend had the New York strip which were both good but average. The truffle Mac and crispy potatoes were winners on the sides for sure!! The chocolate cake was a lava cake that was good. I‚Äôd go back and I recommend giving this place a try!,Good,,
They were serving a tasting menu and everything was very good! The kitchen sure knows how to cook a good filet without ruining it. We were very happy with the atmosphere. There was music but you could still talk and enjoy each others company. It‚Äôs pricy but worth it!,Good,Good,
"New Years Eve Disaster...Looking forward to a great NEw Years Eve Dinner, $145 a head. Group of 10, reservations at 7:30PM, First the service one was on the worst I have ever seen, and both waiters stated they could no wait for the night to be over. Slow to bring drinks, wine, than food as one waiter stated we are out oc scallops, it was a price fix menu! The entire five course meal could have been placed on a dessert plate, Mediocre at best on top of it. At 11:40 PM we are begging to get our bill and get out, 35 minutes it took to bring it. Needless to say it ruined the rest of the evening as we ran to get outside to see the fireworks. JG, if you are going to put together a Dinner event on NYE or any other event, First, hire people who want to be there, next hire a competent purchasing department who can order enough ingredients that you can support the dinner, next think about what you are going to give your customer and its presentation............you completely fail! But last, we sat at a table for four hours, that you should have been able to turn at least one more time, talk about poor business planning. Poor Service, Over priced, no value, poor planning.......you lost ten customers that will never return. Especially in LV where there are lots of options.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Nice restaurant with Good, but honestly the steaks we ordered (at more than 80 usd a piece) were just below average. You can expect a bit more from such a restaurant. If you want to go there for a drink it is OK, but I would not recommend it for food. Starters were also mediocre, with over fried calamari and a ridiculous interpretation of sushi that was just tasteless. 


I had a better steak for 30 USD a couple of days later at an airport steakhouse near O‚Äôhare Chicago.


All in all disappointing.",Bad,Good,Good
"After going to SW steakhouse at the Wynn, Prime at the Bellagio, Heritage at the Mirage.These guys have nothing on Jean Georges at the Aria.
Much more reasonably priced very good selection of affordable wines And most importantly the food was equal or I dare say better than these other high end steakhouse
I d definitely go back",Good,,
Due to it being cold outside we changed our special dinner from Delmonico's to Jean Georges.  The prices are quite a bit more than Delmonico and that would have been fine if it was of the same quality.  There is not as much ambiance and personal service but my food was good.  It was over $200 for two of their most economical steaks and asparagus for 2.  My only add on was a $17 glass of wine (the cheapest on the menu).,Good,,
Highly recommend this place.  We had four couples eating and service was never better. From the seafood appetizer to the calamari the beginning was great.  Everyone had something different and not one of us said it was not one of the best meals we have eaten.  Congrats and job well done.,Good,Good,
Jean George's serves super tender steaks and they make sure you have what you need constantly.  Highly recommend eating here,Good,Good,
"I have dined here many times and it simply has gone from great to greater.  Last night was the Greatest‚Äîin a word Incredible.


They have completed a major renovation of the dinning are and made it even better than before.


Executive Chef Sean Griffin is amazing.  He keeps the menu fresh and my food last night was perfect.


Now the service‚Äîmine was 5 Star.  And here is what happened to the table next to me:  The lady complained to the server about the temp of her filet.  No questions asked.  The server took complete responsibility and removed the dish.  The manager, a relatively short time later, graciously apologized, presented her with a new steak, brought her New fresh sides, and made sure to stay as she cut into the steak and signaled perfection.


Jean Georges‚Äîthe men and women at JGS are zealously protection your name and reputation.  You should be very proud!",Good,Good,Good
"This restaurant was excellent, relative to the food and new atmosphere as it was recently renovated.  My issue was, we had a reservation and arrived a bit early.  They told us to have a seat at the bar because they had no tables available. When we went to the bar, walking past the seating areas, it was evident there had to be about 5 tables which were vacant.  


Be prepared for truly high prices but it didn't matter, we enjoyed the night anyway.  The food was quite good as was the service.  Was it worth $700 + $200 tip????? Probably not.  But, again, it was Good.",Good,,Good
"Food was amazing. Service outstanding.. our waiter was Nat. He was awsome.


My friend and shared the bone in rib. It melted in our mouth.  Nat reccommened sautes spinach and the truffle mac and cheese.
All Awsome.


If you come to Aria.


I highly recommend this place..",Good,Good,Good
"I wished I could rate this 4.5 stars. I wasn't 100% sure of booking based on a few recent reviews however I am glad we chose to eat here.  Atmosphere was amazing, we couldn't decide what to order so went with the tasting menu with pairing wines.  The sommelier was a highlight.  The steak was the other  highlight of the tasting menu and cooked to perfection. The restaurant catered extremely well to both of our preferences with foods. 


Yes the food was expensive but not unreasonable for that style restaurant and not shocked by it. 


Why I have given four stars is my disappointment with the fine dining aspect. We have been very lucky to be able to eat all over the world and honestly our Australian chefs back home are truly amazing. We find it extremely hard to find places that seem to match, for example the salmon dish on the tasting. I felt I could have whipped that up myself at home in half an hour, it was nice but not worthy to be on a tasting menu. 


All in all though we love our restaurants, we had a great time. If I was to go back i would stick with the steaks and some sides. The wagyu melted in our mouths. Amazing.",Good,Good,
"Completely overpriced for the service and quality. The Vegas standard is overpriced anyway, but for what we expected this was a disappointment.  Our server must have been over sat because the time between ordering our drinks and ordering dinner was ridiculous.  Steak plates were lukewarm at best and over cooked.....",Bad,Bad,Bad
"There were 8 of us dining in this restaurant, the atmosphere was lovely, but as we sat down, we were inundated with waiters, basically, too many trying to tend to us and we were asked 3 times by 3 different waiters for our drinks orders when the first guy was already on the case.  8 of us had steaks and only 2 out of the 8 steaks were cooked as we asked, I'm sorry, but in a fine restaurant such as this you would expect the steaks to be cooked to perfection, every single one of them, I had the house fries and they literally looked and tasted like a portion of fries from a burger joint ($15 worth), our bill was over $1,500, the food was tasty, my steak was absolutely gorgeous, but we walked away thinking we wouldn't be back, we were expecting something out of this world but it wasn't to be.",Good,Good,Bad
"When my husband and I first walked up to the restaurant on Friday night November 10, the host/hostess did not have our reservation.  My husband made a reservation that afternoon on open table.  The host then attempted to seat us almost in front of the exit door near a serving station.  The restaurant was only about 33% full at the time.  We asked if we could have a different table.  We were then seated at a high top in the bar.  The table was fine.  The server however was not!!  We ordered drinks, martinis.  We then ordered a wedge salad, calamari, NY strip (medium rare), and mac and cheese.  The service was not good.  The salad and the appetizer came out at the same time.  When we asked about the food service timing (expecting our appetizers first then the salad), she said ""That's how it comes out of the kitchen"".  You could almost hear the eye roll she gave us.  Then it was time for the steak and mac and cheese.  The steak was ordered medium rare.  It came out cold and medium to medium well.  The server then said, with hand on hip and another eye roll, ""I mean I can send it back if you want.""  My husband and I have traveled extensively, this was by far the most overpriced meal with the worst service we have ever had.  I mean you expect you are going to pay a little more.....it's Vegas right.....and we don't mind especially if the atmosphere is great and the food is good.  Unfortunately this experience at Jean and Georges had no redeeming factors.  I would not recommend this restaurant at all!!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This is not cheap, we had two fillets, two side dishes and sparkling water and it was $180 plus tip. It was however a great steak and the mac n cheese delicious. Interesting and tastes bread basket. The restaurant is dark and there ther is an in house photographer if you want a souvenir photo, no pressure if you don't.",Good,,
"My wife and I are big foodies from the Boston area, but travel a fair amount as I work in the hospitality industry. We are not necessarily the ""must be a high end restaurant"" type of people as we love to try all kinds of different things. We love to try different things, but an all around great steakhouse is admittedly one of our favorites.  We don't have a ton of money, so this was a treat we maybe get once or twice a year when we travel. We were here for my 30th birthday on this occasion, and they did not disappoint. Yes, it was on the expensive side, but the service, and atmosphere were excellent while the foods were phenomenal.  I ordered the special bone-in 28 ounce tomahawk rib-eye, while my wife had the Seabass, sides were truffle mac and cheese, and the garlic parm fries.  Everything was probably the best we have ever had.  The Seabass was melt in your mouth delicious, the steak was cooked perfectly with a nice char and great marbling/flavor, and the sides were just as good. Overall I would highly recommend this steakhouse, and hope to return in the future on our next trip to Vegas.",Good,Good,Good
"The atmosphere is nice although a bit noisy.
The food is generally speaking good with the best (truffled mashed potatoes) but also the worse (very nice meat poorly cooked -overdone-)
Good choice of wine but not always served at the proper temperature (too cold Barolo red wine)",,Good,
"Another great restaurant inside of the Aria. While a great place for a business meal, I would also suggest this for a date night or special location. The flavor profiles across the menu are not to be missed. The staff is fantastic.",Good,Good,Good
"This was our second Steakhouse dinner in Las Vegas and I was a little let down. I think my standards were set too high. The food was good, really good to be honest, but I have had better steaks from less expensive Steakhouses. I feel we paid too much for the quality of the food. If money isn't an issue than this is an ideal place for you. The servers are amazing and knowledgeable.


If you're like us, and going out to a nice restaurant is an event that rarely happens, then I would skip Jean George's Steakhouse.",Bad,,Good
"As we have had the good fortune to experience having dined at restaurants of various cuisines and flavors throughout the world, we especially enjoy fine steakhouses across the United States.  What‚Äôs most important to us is the ‚ÄúTotal Dining Experience‚Äù, a well-run establishment with great food, good atmosphere, exceptional service, clean, and with hospitality that values their clientele and treats all patrons as regulars. Jean Georges, Las Vegas not only meets but exceeds the highest standards of expectations. It‚Äôs the kind of place where you could have fun with a group of any size or a very special intimate encounter.  I especially enjoy the bacon and blue cheese iceberg wedge and as always, the perfectly seasoned and flawlessly prepared Bone In Rib-Eye accompanied by a half pound of Alaskan King Crab legs.  Be prepared to pay as much as you would expect in any ‚Äúhigh end‚Äù steakhouse but also look forward to enjoying the quintessential, ‚ÄúTotal Dining Experience‚Äù.",Good,Good,Good
"For such a highly claimed restaurant, this was a major letdown. We ordered the A5 Wagyu, 8oz filet, and salmon. Having eaten high quality wagyu in Japan, I can honestly say the beef here did not compare. At $60 per ounce, and the associated almost pretentious presentation by the servers, you expect a certain standard that was not met. The bill was over $400 for a party of 2 and that only included one glass of Malbec. 


There are far better options for good steak.",Bad,Bad,
"If you want to enjoy a nice evening at a great steakhouse with top notch service, AVOID THIS PLACE. We were really looking forward to a great dinner based on reviews we read and we were extremely disappointed. 40 minutes late on seating us with a reservation with tables sitting dirty.  Finally sat and ordered wine.  After 15 minutes no wine. Adios.  I hear they are changing the name to ‚ÄúFor Lease‚Äù.  Go to Craftsteak at MGM.",,Bad,Bad
"Delightful food, excellent table service, but EXTREMELY expensive.  If you were to treat yourself for something SPECIAL just once on your visit, this restaurant will not dissappoint.",Good,,Good
"We started our Las Vegas experience with the sage - a very good choice. 
However this restaurant topped that easily. 


Yes it is (very) pricey. 
But it is one of the very few worldwide that serves A5 Kobe beef. 


But even the other options are fantastic, the wagyu filet is an absolute stunner. 


The wines are selected and expensive, but we did not see a single one you would be disappointed with. However I would have to add that the red wine did come to the table way too cold - that was a faux pass. 


All in all I would still say this was one of the best meals I ever had.",Good,Good,
"I am a steak house snob and as Jean Georges is not normally in the conversation of best Vegas steakhouses I did not have high expectations.  Ended up having a fantastic experience and would highly recommend.  Tuna tartare as a starter was perfect, nice sized portion and had a little kick.  The bone in rib-eye was cooked perfectly and very high quality beef, could stack up with any other steakhouse in Vegas.  Slightly disappointed in the truffled mac cheese, very weak truffle flavor.  Finished with the gold bar, which just for the presentation is worth it.  As others have mentioned its not cheap, but not different than the other high end steak houses.  Looking forward to going again.",Good,Good,
"Steaks were very good, our group tried the grass fed filets, tomahawk, and I had the NY strip. Was perfectly cooked and flavorful, I didn't even add salt. Side dishes were good too, enough to share. 
Reason for not 5 star is everything was very good, but not my all time favorite steak and sides were ordinary",Good,,
Food was good but not amazing.  Overpriced for the quality of food.  You are really paying for the service.  Sauces with the steak are a nice touch.,Bad,,Good
"Had a great evening at Jean Georges.  Between three of us we ordered 3 different cuts of beef and shared family style.  Japanese Kobe, Wagu Filet, and Bone in Prime Rib Eye.  All were outstanding and different in flavor profile and texture.  Each perfectly cooked and presented.  Cut table into strips for us to share.  The asparagus was outstanding as was the ceasar salad.  Wine selection was impressive as well with expert sommelier to help guide selection.  Simply a perfect evening.  I can be hard to impress at a steak house.  That night was impressive.  Highly recommended.",Good,Good,Good
Had a lovely dinner with 8 friends on a Saturday night.  The food was good not amazing.  It was expensive and the service was good but not amazing.  Should have been amazing.,Good,,Good
"Seated quickly, service was very good. Fillet was average, nothing to write home about. Baked potatoe was huge and exceptional. Fair wine by the glass choices. Pricey, nicely decorated, but food was not what had hooed for.",Good,Good,Good
One of the great ones. Our dinner was exceptional. Well prepared and timed brilliantly.  The steaks and sides are extraordinary.,Good,Good,
"Large table formats, in an environment that allows one to talk, and enjoy Good.   I especially liked the sirloin steak, the filet mignon was nice and tender, and the sides are ample.",Good,Good,
"I want this restaurant to be so good, after seeing the pictures on the internet. I can't comment on the food as we never got any I can say we waited 1hr 20 mins and the attitude of the staff and manager is awful..........",,Bad,Bad
Had the best steak in town . Enjoyed the ambiance and the great service and wine . The menus is extraordinary and the wait staff was great ..,Good,Good,Good
The Chateaubriand was tender and perfectly cooked!  The staff very attentive although the drink orders were delayed due to a special request for a Midleton Very Rare Irish Whiskey.  The birthday cake was absolutely delicious and made to my specifications.  My only suggestion is that the  quality of whiskeys (like Midleton) should match the outstanding cuisine and wine list.,Good,,Good
You can't go wrong with prime steak and this place has great choices. The ribeye is excellent. Be sure to try the tomato avacado salad if you go.,Good,,
"Took out 7 people for a business dinner. The cocktails were great when they were actually delivered. I really don't mind overpriced restaurants if the quality and service commensurate, but here this is not the case. It is over priced for the sake of it and everything else does not synch. 70 dollars for a 1 lb lobster that was overcooked and mushy was absurd. Then there was the 265 dollar tomahawk ribeye, which was nice, but not 265 dollars nice. Sides were standard, nothing remarkable and all around 20 dollars. Carbone next door in the Aria is a far, far, far better choice. Avoid this restaurant. Lame service. Lame all together.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This is simply the best steak/dining experience I have had in the world. Everything from the moment we entered to the minute we left was exceptional.


The restaurant ambiance was great, it wasn't a quiet restaurant in regards to you can only hear knives and forks but it wasn't a loud rowdy place it was nice. People enjoying themselves eating great food.


My husband and I came here three years ago when we got engaged and I was so looking forward to coming again but was almost nervous incase it didn't live up to expectations and I needn't of worried it exceeded all expectations and more. Our server was great and very knowledgeable and made some great recommendations, the food came out and was hot and cooked to perfection, I honestly cannot rate this restaurant high enough.
Cocktails are delish here also. 


Jean George's also knew it was my husbands and I first anniversary and they surprised us with a lovely dessert which was complementary. They also had a photographer come round and take some pictures of us which was $70 but defiantly worth it, the pictures were lovely.


It's not the cheapest restaurant that's for sure but when the food and service is this good you won't mind and it worth every dollar.",Good,Good,Good
"I have been to Aria quite a few times and every time I make sure to dine at Jean Georges.  Steak is always cooked to perfection and the bar staff is fast, knowledgeable, attentive, and engaged.  Highly suggest stopping in here when in town.",Good,Good,Good
"Excellent food, esp the sea bass with the exotic mushroom.  Nice bar and bartenders.
Great wine selection!",Good,,Good
"Went to Jean Georges for my birthday in August- looks great after the remodel, and the food and service hasn't dipped at all since!  The new bread they brought out was amazing, and the steak, as usual, was better than anything I can order in North Carolina.  Juan and Jason were our servers, and they were very attentive and fun to chat with.  The steak sauces are a bit odd, but a great steak doesn't need much sauce (if any, in my opinion), so it didn't bother me at all.  Dessert was fantastic- I'm typically not a cheesecake person, but I couldn't stop eating it.  Will definitely be back again soon!",Good,Good,Good
"From the beginning, to the end, this was an exceptional experience. We chose this restaurant to celebrate my birthday. We decided on the Dungeness crab cake, as an appetizer. Loved it. I also had an Iceberg lettuce wedge, which was dressed with blue cheese dressing, tomatoes and bacon. I also had the 8 oz. filet mignon and the truffle mashed potatoes. My brother went with the 18 oz. bone-in ribeye,  the saut√©ed spinach, and the mushrooms. The butter, served with the Brioche bread, is improved with fresh herbs, which was an appreciated touch. The service, received throughout the evening, was impeccable.",Good,Good,Good
Went there last night with 5 of my friends to celebrate my birthday. The place was busy but not overly so. While the food was excellent the service was seriously lacking. Not sure if it‚Äôs because we were a table of 6 gay guys but the two managers walking around certainly avoided our table while checking on everyone else‚Äôs. We ordered a $400+ bottle of wine and no one came back checking if we wanted more of it. We weren‚Äôt upset but more disappointed having eaten at a lot of other Jean Georges properties. My friend had the ch√¢teaubriant and it was exceptional so was he rest of the meats served.,Good,Good,
"We had a lovely tasting menu at this restaurant, the food was excellent and the service was most of the time courteous for Vegas, depending on the waitress/waiter.",Good,Good,Good
Disappointed I want to have a great meal. Instead over seasoned sea bass and sadly they used 2 table spoons of salt on the mushrooms who doses that? Mac and cheese with black truffles not good. Spent over $ 300 and got a real poor meal. The salmon was prepared properly and the appetizers I had were. The tuna tartare was very good and so is the crab cakes so they did something right. The service was excellent there was a photographer there that was very pushy and I did not like. I would not go back,Bad,Bad,Good
"I had the 8 oz filet.  I usually like all my meat well-done but I know you're not supposed to get filet mignon well-done.  I told the waiter to have it cooked medium-well but absolutely no red juices coming out on my plate when I cut into it. (Lol) He suggested having it ""butterflied"".  That steak was THE BEST steak I've EVER eaten in my life!!  No steak sauce was even needed.  Also, had the lobster and cheese mashed potatoes.  Wish it had a tad more lobster but was delicious!  Service was impeccable!  Wish we had a Jean Georges Steakhouse in Atlanta.",Good,Good,Good
Amazing amazing amazing food! Easily the best steak dinner we've ever had. We were treated so well and had a very memorable meal. If there is a fault it's that the atmosphere felt a bit flat but an insignificant detail in comparison to the food and service.,Good,Bad,Good
"We had the pleasure of eating at this restaurant when we stayed at Vdara. The food was top notch and the service was even better. It is an upscale restaurant in price and service. We read that you needed to dress up, but we still went casual. I would absolutely dine here again!",Good,Good,Good
"My mom, two sisters and I had the most delicious dinner and fabulous evening at Jean Georges Steakhouse last week. We were celebrating two BIG birthdays and the staff were exceptional.


All the food was beyond delicious - from the freshly-baked, warm loaf of bread to the juiciest, best-I've-ever-tasted rib steak and wonderful side dishes (especially the truffle mash and truffle mac and cheese) - every mouthful was a taste sensation beyond our expectations!


We weren't planning to have dessert, but our charming waiter, Ramon, brought out three unbelievable desserts for us with candles on them! Each dessert was exceptional, and even though we were full, we couldn't help but eat them all!


Everything about this restaurant made our evening a five star experience:


- The FOOD! WOW!
- The service - friendly, attentive, professional and thoughtful;
- The decor - pure modern elegance, but relaxed;
- The wine and cocktails - excellent selection!
- Even the bathroom is stunning (however, we only vouch for the ladies'!)


Our birthday dinner was beyond wonderful and although not inexpensive, it was worth every penny!


Thank you to all the staff working that night and an extra big thank you to the wonderful Ramon!",Good,Good,Good
"My besty and I were standing outside of Planet Hollywood looking at the billboard in front of the Aria Hotel whilw waiting on the water show at the Balagio to start. As we continued looking at the billboard, we noticed a bone in ribeye that lookwd really good. So, we both said that we were going to have dinner there with our spouses, and we did. The bone in ribeye was excellent, it was cooked perfectly and the sides were great as well.",Good,,
"Service in this restaurant was superb. Professional and thorough, non intrusive and polite. My favorite dish was the seafood platter, super fresh, delicious oysters, shrimp, crab. My Chilean sea bass was good, served with cluster mushrooms but I probably would try meat next time as all steak dishes ordered at the table, from filet to rib eye received  rave reviews. Special mention to the side dish of roasted mushrooms. So tasty! Excellent experience, would highly recommend!",Good,Good,Good
Ate here with friends while staying at Aria. The service was attentive but not intrusive. The waitstaff was knowledgable of the menu and wine list. The food was good-standard steak house fare. The decor is modern and intimate-not at all stuffy like many high quality steakhouses. Definitely recommend as a special occasion spot.,Good,Good,Good
"The staff were personable and attentive. I had the bone in ribeye ($70), and the most wonderful turffle mashed potatoes I've EVER eaten. I wanted to marry those mashed potatoes!. The wine list is extensive and not really outrageous. I know a 3X upcharge is usual, and a bottle of Dom Perignon is only $131. I was shocked at that. I don't like Dom, but heck!
I never order my steak well or well done, because it can get tough. My ribeye was medium and wonderfully charcoaled on the outside and buttery on the inside. All of the cuts of meat are from specific farms and locations. The Wagyu meat was from that famous prefecture in Japan. I will try it one day! $180 an 8 ounce portion is so expensive though!
 I declined dessert, the dessert list didn't strike my fancy. And I am a dessert guy!",Good,,Good
"As I probably mentioned in many of my previous reviews, my husband and I love travelling and experiencing different restaurants. We decided to celebrate our anniversary dinner at Jean Georges Steakhouse last year when we were in Vegas, and sadly, I cannot give it a 5 star. Food was good but not very good, but for me, customer service is what attracts me back as a customer. The staff were obnoxious, their greetings was not so welcoming,  I made a note that it was my anniversary when I reserved and that was not acknowledged!  To make it easier this year, I decided to reserve somewhere else, NOVE Italiano. I have to say that I have no regrets!",Good,Bad,Bad
"The Jean George dining experience was extremely disappointing.  What started off as a very nice staff welcoming with a fantastic appetizer went down hill very quickly with our main course.  My husband and I both had steaks, which were tough and not extremely palatable.  We are in the cattle business and feel sorry for all of the patrons who were served the same steaks as we were. The potatoes were great, but the creamed spinach and mushrooms were very bland and were cool when they arrived to the table.  The restaurant was nice enough to provide us a dessert since we were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary.  We will not be returning to this restaurant after spending so much money on an unpleasant dinner.",Bad,Bad,Good
"We enjoyed the classic tasting menu with wine pairing on a Monday night and experienced perfectly prepared dishes and excellent, attentive service.  I would not bother ordering a la carte here when the tasting menu is so well selected and priced.  The wagyu beef melts in your mouth.  The caviar appetizer if ordered at the snobby caviar lounge off the Bellagio lobby would probably cost as much as the entire meal at Jean Georges.  I would stick to the classic tasting menu and skip any add-ons offered (for our night, it was a lobster mashed potato side served with the steak and it was both unnecessary and a little too salty).  I would go back here again and again.  Plus, the background music in the room is a mix of fun 70's and 80's club music so for us 50 somethings, it was like playing a trivia game during the meal.",Good,Good,Good
"I ate here recently while on business in Vegas. The restaurant's a nice enough setting although perhaps a little dark and traditional for my taste but very much in keeping with the 'American Steakhouse'.


I must admit up front that I don't really ""get"" the idea of a high-end steakhouse in the sense that a well cooked steak with some basic vegetables (like mash) is something that I can cook myself at home - it's pretty easy cooking and so I don't really line it up with 'fine dining'.


Jean Georges though seems to take that theme and run with it to the extreme offering side dishes like mashed potato (closer to puree in my opinion) for around $15-$18 and steaks that stretch off way beyond $60+. 


It didn't gel for me and I felt like the restaurant was almost yelling out ""look how expensive we have made this simple food"" and I was a bit unimpressed with the whole thing.


To try and keep my bill within the stratosphere I ate a burger. I enjoy a good burger but, frankly, I found the $30+ burger here to be distinctly average and I didn't really enjoy it.


I wouldn't revisit Jean Georges - it's not my type of place and I suspect there is far, far better food out there in Las Vegas at far more reasonable prices.",Bad,Bad,
"One of my top 3 in Vegas.  Service is extremely attentive.  Sweet rolls and herbed butter are just the start.  Generously poured whiskey and scotch served in a cut crystal glass.
we had wagu filets and both were done perfectly.   Then there was truffle mashed potatoes that were smooth .  We had a gold brick for dessert which was chocolate ganache and passion fruit.  Unbelievable.  
.  A beautiful night out.  I'm very excited to return.",Good,Good,Good
"When Jean Georges Steakhouse closed its doors in June for a touch up there was an audible sigh of relief, a hotel that has not been shy to blow up concepts instead doing right by simply brightening the fa√ßade and updating wallpaper while Chef Sean Griffin benefitted from a trip to help the boss open up shop in Los Angeles and a return to new menus, a kitchen Herb garden and some fun service items. 


Using the clever slogan of ‚ÄúThe only thing aging is our Steaks‚Äù throughout the update, though in reality the dining room had always been one of the most modern of Las Vegas‚Äô top-tier Steakhouses, it was as a party of three that a visit was paid to the newly re-opened space just one day after Chef Vongerichten had departed, the facility changes only obvious to regulars looking for them while the seasonal menu update speaks to a restaurant continuously focused on perfecting each guest‚Äôs dining experience.


If anything less-stylized than prior, abstract Cows gone but overhead music still energetic with the wall of wine untouched and new chairs apparently coming soon, it was after greetings at the podium that guests were led to a table with good lighting towards the back of the room, Chef Griffin stopping by to say hello along with the GM and a Carte Blanche Dinner soon to start with a glass of Bubbles and Parker House-inspired Brioche served with Herb Butter.


Frequently starting tasting menus with Caviar, the Egg Caviar one of those beloved signatures still offered daily at his Michelin 3* New York Flagship, it was on a sous vide Egg Yolk sandwiched between Buttered Brioche that a heap of Golden Osetra was piled to begin a three-hour night unveiled in five courses, three refreshing and well balanced Cocktails arriving just moments before the Steakhouse‚Äôs signature Wagyu Carpaccio Gougeres, a bright Tomato Salad featuring an Intuitive Forager‚Äôs bounty and a ‚Äòvery Jean Georges‚Äô plate of Japanese Snapper with Pickled Cherry Peppers, Mint and Toasted Sesame Seeds that was served as part of a Wine dinner the evening prior.


Continuing to work with certain ingredients, an ‚Äòif it isn‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it‚Äô sort of mentality that currently sees Griffin‚Äôs Bacon Wrapped Shrimp prepared with White Peach Mustard and just a touch of Horseradish, those who‚Äôve been lucky enough to try Jean George Steakhouse‚Äôs Foie Gras in the past will be happy to see the Pepper Crusted Steak is back with a Marcona Almond Crunch and Strawberries, though the version on this particularly night was instead offered with reduced Black Cherries and Celery Leaf plus a kiss of Amaretto.


Slowly enjoying Sweet Corn Soup poured tableside, the heat, Citrus and Ginger all speaking volumes about Sean‚Äôs ability to adapt Vongerichten‚Äôs style to the season, course three included a flaky filet of Mikuni Wild Harvest Halibut paired to crunchy Potatoes and pickled Peppers, the Organic Chicken served next to it still Sin City‚Äôs best Fried Bird and easily large enough to be shared for those dining on a budget.


Anticipating big things as part of the entrees, the menu now even more loaded in top quality cuts from some of the World‚Äôs best purveyors than before, it was with a tableside show that Chef Griffin and a waitress prepared three types of protein; Lamb Chops with a light kick grassy and tender while Short Ribs dressed in Flowers required no more than a spoon to be liberated from the Bone, a whole Wagyu Brisket still jiggly when presented proving buttery soft to the knife with fat completely melted beneath the beautifully charred bark rich with flavors of housemade Doenjang.


Going Surf n‚Äô Turf with a half-pound of King Crab Legs and forearm-size Prawns soaked in Butter, sides on this particular night continuing to speak volumes about Jean George‚Äôs ingredients, the Robuchon-esque Potatoes and head-turning Bone Marrow once again earning ‚Äúmust order‚Äù approval while the Sweet Corn Polenta with Truffles, Spicy Broccolini and Tempura‚Äôd Whole Cauliflower were all new additions that continued to display the Restaurant‚Äôs dominance in a city where places like Carnevino and CUT also strive to make the items served *with* the Steak an equally integral part of the meal.


At this point pretty well sated, or in other words stuffed, it was alongside an Iced Double Espresso that two familiar faces were presented alongside a returned seasonal favorite and one new showstopper, the Apple Pie still head and shoulders above any other in Sin City while Harry‚Äôs Strawberries came in a half-dozen forms as part of the buttery Linzer with a hint of Licorice, the 100% Jean Georges Gold Bar outperforming  a personal bias against Passion Fruit by mellowing the oft-cloying flavor with creamy Hazelnut Mousse, Mango and plenty of Milk Chocolate.


FIVE STARS:  Though many well-traveled diners may poo-poo Las Vegas as the land of Celebrity Chefs and enormous dining rooms, Jean Georges Steakhouse definitely fitting the bill on both accounts, it would be hard for anyone to name a better collection of Steaks, Sides and Entrees than what is on display at Aria‚Äôs 2nd Floor elderstatesman in 2017, the recent renovations making the space even more inviting while the kitchen led by Sean Griffin continues to perform on a World Class level even when filled.",Good,Good,
"Outsranding.  From the moment you arrive hospitality is superb. They have a beautiful wine selection and an area in which you can sit amongst many of the wine bottles. They offered a delicious cocktail of grandma yay and Hennessy if I believe a splash of peach nectar. Absolutely refreshing. We all shared dishes. The brisket was mouth-watering. I found out from the chef that they cook it 12 hours prior to serving an absolute must. The ribeye was absolutely fabulous. Honestly it was hard to share it you wanted to savor every last bite. I indulged in a butterscotch salted pudding that was fabulous. Not too sweet and the topping was about a quarter inch thick white almost similar to a creme fraiche. So it matched lovely with the sweetness of the pudding. But the best part was they were able to imprint the chefs picture on the top. In speaking with the staff. I found out it was a machine that they had, that you can actually imprint any image on the desert or even on the phone with coffee, I must I must purchase one of these machines it's truly fabulous",Good,Good,Good
"All of the food--salads, australian steak, scallops--was delicious. The sides added to the meal-be warned, the side portions are for sharing! Dessert was delicious and the drinks were well made with a good selection. Our server was tuned in to the pace and vibe of our meal and really added to the meal with his approach to service.",Good,,Good
"I took my team to Jean Georges for dinner after our conference.  We had a party of 10 and they seated us in their private room.  A very nice touch.  The service was great, the steaks were fantastic!!  Extensive wine list.  The sides were wonderful (mac & cheese was the best).  Small desert menu.",Good,Good,Good
"With its recent makeover, Jean Georges Steakhouse just got even better.  It is a much softer atmosphere now.


The food is outstanding.  Chef Sean Griffin uses high quality meats and only the freshest produce.  All of which is prepared to look and taste incredible.


The service is attentive with a main server and an assistant server for each table plus the manager is extremely friendly and helpful--not just a ""numbers"" guy who is working to turn the tables.


Definitely a 5 Star experience!",Good,Good,Good
Had a business dinner at Jean Georges - had the big prime ribeye - it was fine.  The service was sub par - couldn't get Drinks as needed - the staff was totally unable to provide an experience in line with dramatically high prices.  I'll stop just short of calling it a rip off but was left feeling disappointed.,Good,Bad,Bad
Every time I come to Las Vegas I always eating this restaurant I have never ever been dissatisfied and I always have Good great food and a great time and I always say this is the best meal I ever had in my life now keep in mind you get what you pay for this restaurant is very expensive and a couple can very easily drop 400to 700 bucks. So if you decide to try this restaurant ask for James to be your server you will not be disappointed,Good,Good,Good
"My husband and I had dinner at JG's on Thursday evening, May 18th. The restaurant is very elegant and has nice ambience however the food is overpriced and not up to the standards for what they charge. My husband ordered the Wagyu steak it was super salty he had trouble eating it. We ordered the spinach and the potatoes neither were up to our expectations. I ordered the king crab legs which were good but nothing I had not experienced before. We were both a bit disappointed and don't think we will return.",Bad,Good,
Went to celebrate my husbands birthday. We both had filets which were excellent. Shared a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus which were ideal sizes to share. Service was wonderful without being over bearing. Ambience was great. They surprised hubby with a wonderful dessert. Definitely will go back again.,Good,Good,Good
"Service is 5 Star, steaks are average and over priced.  The Sea Bass is to die for, best Sea Bass I have ever had.  Restaurant is ok, the service made the experience special, not the food.",Bad,,Good
Had an outstanding meal last Saturday night! The service was excellent and we had a delightful waitress. Can't wait to visit Vegas again so I can eat a steak at Jean George's !,Good,Good,Good
"If you are going to Vegas--you need to have a good dinner 


NY Strip A-
Cheesecake A
Wine List A


Reservations a must.",Good,Good,
"Had dinner with colleagues here last night and was incredibly disappointed. My steak was very gristly and hard to cut and the bernaise  sauce was runny and not flavorful. For $60 a steak the expectation would be that it is superb. Everything else was just ok...except the service. Service was very good. 


The night before we were over at DOCG at the Cosmo for dinner and we had a steak we shared that was unbelievably good and half the price. Go there if you want an amazing steak!  Just saying...",Bad,,Good
Service was really good. Had seafood platter which was delicious. My steak  (bone in NY) came out and was warm but definitely not hot which to me is a sin when eating at a high end steakhouse. Kinda disappointing.,Good,,Good
"Terrible, especially for the money.  Steaks were low grade and flattened like an old school Sizzler steak. At least the salad was decent.  


We left at went to a burger joint on the strip. With all the choices for Steak in Vegas, anyone is better off at another choice.",Bad,,
"This is one of our favorite restaurants for dinner in Las Vegas that we never miss when we visit the area.  Delicious pretzel bread, sea bass (please NEVER take this off the menu!), filet, and great sides to choose from to share.  Great service and has a wonderful atmosphere.",Good,Good,Good
"Last meal here was about 2 years ago. Server was a pro at what he did and never missed a beat for the entire experience. Several shared appetizers, great wine recommendations, never an empty cocktail glass and seemed to appear anytime we were in need of something. Atmosphere is great and the vieb is not too loud so you are able to hear each other at the table. Steak is a competitive game in Vegas but this is one I would repeat again when staying at Aria or nearby.",Good,Good,Good
"Group of 4 had the tasting menu for dinner.  One great dish after another culminating with Kobe beef medallions as main entree.  Outstanding dining experience.  My second time there.  Highly recommend


Corkage fee is $50 per bottle.",Good,Good,
We were there to have a business dinner and we found it average or less in quality. Prices are really high (2x-6x) without having a realistic justification.,Bad,,
I am required to type 100 characters. I don't need to though to describe the food and service. Outstanding!,Good,,Good
"I understand that this is a steak house, however the first thing that was disappointing was the lack of options for the non-steak eater...yes, they do exist! And while I am not big on steak I do like to accompany my husband who loves a nice steak. Yes, the restaurant is very expensive and we have no problem spending a lot of money when it comes to a culinary experience (we own a very successful catering business so new foods and techniques are very important to us and we see the value in it). That said, this was a lot of money for (in my opinion) the same old high end-steak house. The pricing actually on some of the items was laughable and insulting for what you received. For instance, we started with the cold seafood platter for two, priced at $78. We live in NY and had some expectations for what we would get in a nice restaurant with this. Instead we were presented with a small bowl full of crushed ice..in it was literally two tiny raw clams...two small oysters...one half lobster tail (petite) and a single crab leg. For our entrees my husband ordered the rib eye steak, which was a nice steak, tender and served with some nice dipping sauces. I ordered the veal and was frankly shocked when the dish came out. After the tiny serving of seafood, I was presented with three large fried cutlets serves on an unruly and overflowing bed of arugula and covered in tomatoes. I did not even know how to approach the dish. The cutlets were really oily and also saturated in the salad dressing on the bottom. We ended up sending it back (which I cannot remember the last time I did that). The truffled mash potatoes were quite tasty and the creamed spinach was well, creamed spinach. In the end we spent $300 for one appetizer, one entree, two sides and two glasses of Prosecco. On the upside, if you are using the corporate card you probably won't care and the atmosphere and the service was definitely on par!",Bad,Good,Good
Situated in the Aria Resort & Casino a delightful high class restaurang with superb steaks (Kobe). Started with oyesters and topped with a Kobe filet mignon. Most propably the very best meal I have enjoyed together with excellent wines from a wide variety.,Good,Good,
"We stopped into this restaurant on a whim and we were more than pleased. This was a first class experience from start to finish.  We were greeted with friendly smiles more than happy to accommodate us even though we did not have a reservation. After being seated, to say the service was outstanding is an understatement. Although Brad was our server, we had many people including Reed, German, and Reggie, who made this dining an experience. They engaged us in friendly conversation, and had the perfect balance in being attentive while still allowing my husband and myself to have an intimate experience. Brad made unbelievable recommendations in both food and wine.  He truly displayed knowledge of the menu and an understanding for his clientele. The food was absolutely incredible! We both had the grass fed filet mignon and were so impressed with the flavor and cut of meat.  Although they bring an array of sauces to the table for the steak, the cut and quality of the meat is such that they are not needed. Additionally, the truffled Mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were a perfect compliment. We were thoroughly impressed with this entire experience to say the least.",Good,Good,Good
"I had dinner at Jean Georges last Friday with my wife and brother in law.  It was one of the best meals I have ever had.  We started with some cocktails in the reception area.  My wife had a killer Lemon Drop Martini and I had a few glasses of Scotch.  The Scotch selection was great.  We took our time at the bar and were not rushed to our table despite going about 20 minutes over our reservation.  Jack was our server, and he was great.  Outgoing, upbeat, great personality.  I had the 18oz Ribeye with the black truffle mac n cheese.  The wife had the Kobe Filet and truffle mashed potatoes.  We also shared an order of Alaskan King Crab.  Every single bite was perfection.  I ordered the steak medium rare and it was perfect.  I read a few of the really negative reviews and Im confused if they are talking about the same place? If you want a cheap steak, go to a cheap steakhouse.  If you want an amazing experience with food that is too die for, then go to Jean Georges! I was raised in Chicago with some of the best steakhouses in the US, and Jean Georges knocked it out of the park.  I will 100% be back!  To be honest- if the General Manager read this and offered me a gift card I would probably book a trip back to Vegas just to eat there again!  Amazing!  A+++",Good,Good,Good
Omg.. you expect great restaurants chefs in vegas.. this hit the top.  The wine pairing was spot on.. food... dear god I'm still talking about it.. it just kept getting better as the courses went on.. the staff was lovely. Quiet great atmosphere.  Perfectly timed and cooked. Best meal I've had.. it was better than sex.. mouth heaven.. talk about Meg ryan.. yup that was me eating my meal.,Good,Good,
"This is your place to go.  From service, to the food and staff treatment, it's all one package.  Worth every minute.",Good,Good,Good
"The food is just incredible.  I loved the rib eye steak and the salt and pepper crusted baked potato.  My wife had the Chilean Sea Bass, and said it may have been the best she has ever enjoyed.  The various sauces that they offer are just fantastic.  However, what made this dining experience even better was the great service we received from the waiters.  Both Ben and Ramon could not have been nicer, or more attentive.  They really made our dining experience something special.  We will definitely return to this great restaurant.  Pricey?  Yes, but so worth it.",Good,Good,Good
"While in Vegas two weeks ago a friend and I went to this steakhouse inside the aria hotel . Server was polite and knowledgable. 
We both ordered the filet. I got the small one and he got the bigger one and a side of the lobster mashed potatoes . 
The filet was great . Their Medium rare was more like a medium but I still enjoyed it . Server seemed a little off although very polite.
I got the Aperol Spritz and my friend had a beer. 
Aperol spritz was terrible! How can you mess up a drink that is so simple ? Server never noticed that I only took a few sips and didn't bother to ask if I liked it or not . Needles to say , I didn't drink it! 
We got our steaks  and about half way through it out lobster mashed potatoes came out , after we brought up to their attention that we didn't get it . 
No bread was offered, thought that was weird since most steakhouses have some sort of bread to offer. 
The sauces they bring with their meats are great! 
We were still eating and Server assistants asked us twice if they could take our plates. Really ? I know it was late, but it's VEGAS ! I thought that since we had a 10pm reservation they didn't close till late so I didn't understand them rushing us.
No communication between server assistant and server. When we were finally done eating, we ordered coffee  from our server. A few minutes after, same server assistant comes and asks us if we are ready for our check! I was gonna order some dessert too but after that I really felt like they didn't want us there so We asked for our check. I was gonna say something But didn't want to upset my friend who's very shy when it comes to stuff like this. 
Overall, it's Vegas ! There's plenty of options for fine dining and this is certainly not the best option . Maybe it's not like that all the time but I come to Vegas often and for sure will never come back to this place.",Good,,Good
"All three of our meals were wonderful.  They included Veal Milanese, Steak and Fish.  Our server was very attentive.",Good,,Good
"I was excited to dine at a resto by Jean George. His reputation precedes him.  The experience given its name sake's reputation should be stellar. .


From the price of the tasting menu we assumed that the wagyu would be a very small bite of real Japanese wagyu given the hype on the menu and the presentation of the official Kobe trophy.  It never occurred to us that it would be  imitation wagyu from Australia.  That was the least of the issues.


Our main server knew little about the menu.  When I asked him about the wagyu he suggested it was A5.  The Japanese Wagyu probably was.  When I asked him about the marbling he looked like a deer in the headlights.  If you want to charge 400 dollars for a steak, you outta know something about the product.  He came back and said he thought it was 9-12.  Heck of a range and I'm pretty sure he had no idea if what he spoke.  It would have been nice if someone told us that the wagyu on the tasting menu was not real.  The meat we got was a generic piece of well cooked tenderloin.  I've had more marbling on supermarket meat.  


As the food service started,  each plate was dropped off without any explanation of what was on the plate.  When I insisted I know, I was given a series of truths, half truths and nonsense.  The server had no clue what he was serving. His colleague was better.  The server did not deserve to be serving high end food. He contributed to a mess of a meal.


Menu items were unfairly described.  For example the ""oscietra caviar"" was really a beignet, with a tiny spoonful of caviar.  According to two waiters it came from a)Iran or b) Israel.  Each spoken with each confidence.  The wagyu, once in front of us was from either a) Japan or b) Australia. The truffle had nothing to do with the potatoes on the wagyu course.


The entire meal was a disappointment. I wrote to the manager, saying the above and more.  I received a pleasant informative reply, apologizing for the failures.  Unfortunately the reply missed the point which is the manager and the kitchen need to inform the front of house of what is on the plates they deliver.  There was not one dish properly described by the server.  The entire staff failed us.  And no Mr Choi, I won't be coming for a complementary wagyu tasting.  I don't need it.  I have tried ""wagyu"" from five countries and know it's not the same as real wagyu...none of it.  Your staff could use the training though, so I donate your offer to our server.Desperately.  You've let them down and through them your patrons.  One saving grace was the the very good pricing, easing the pain a bit.  Had the price point been higher, the rating would have been lower.  You need the boss to come by for a tune up.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had a dinner for a family celebration !
The cuisine was excellent !
The waitresses were most gracious and professional !
The bill was stratospheric all included with a 25% gratuity ..... $300 per person!!!!!
I knew we were on the Strip and I am a Las Vegan for the last 27 years, so very
familiar with MY town.
But the insult to injury: I was asked to pay a $13.00 parking ticket after spending $1200!!!!!
The staff was very embarrassed for ""they could not anything for me ""..!
So please, stay away from such abuse!",Good,,Good
"Excellent Experience
 
We went to Jean George at the Aria for my fianc√©s birthday. Everything was perfect at this stylish restaurant. We were greeted by the hostess and seated promptly.


The drinks they served were delicious and the bread they brought was delicious. For our starters we got tuna tartar and the ribs. It was perfectly made and it was super fresh. The ribs were very well seasoned and succulent.


We came to Jean George for the Tomahawk steak but this off menu item was very popular and not available the day we visited. The waiter told us next time to call ahead and reserve a Tomahawk. We ordered the rib eye and sirloin for the main dish. The rib eye was the best choice; it was delicious with a beautiful crust and cooked to a perfect medium. We ordered mushrooms and lobster mashed potatoes for our sides. Both of these choices were delicious and a perfect compliment to the steaks.  The decor was very modern and had a Spanish influence. The waiters are attentive, professional and enhance the dining experience.


I would go back to Jean George in a heart beat.",Good,Good,Good
"The service was rushed at first. My son and I ordered the tasting menu and the first course arrived nearly simultaneously with our pre-dinner cocktails. We asked that they slow things down and they did.
We ordered oysters to interrupt the planned course presentation. They handled the interruption well but, the oysters were subpar.
All in all, the dinner was great but not even close to the New York venue.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Dinner for both my Dad & I , 
we enjoyed the bacon wrapped shrimp, & shrimp cocktail. 


I had a the 8oz grass fed filet - he had the 12 oz NY Strip


The asparagus & Truffle mashed potatoes were DELICIOUS as well as enough as the two sides for us to share!


You may not want dessert but I do highly recommend the apple pie with pecan ice cream. Everything was made in house!


Make reservations!!!",Good,,
We had a group of 15 and the venue was great. Everything from the steak's to the Chillean Seabass. The appetizers were outstanding.  Not crazy about the Cesar salad not having anchovies but all in all it was a great dinner.,Good,Good,
"We were staying at the Aria Hotel wanted a good steak so decided to eat here on the 2nd of March.  Restaurant looks great, staff were really friendly and a credit to the restaurant, however food is way overpriced for the quality, the 2 starters we had were ok but that's about it, nothing to right home about, main course just a rip off $80 steaks, I had a rib eye, half the steak was fat, taste was ok, chips were soggy not crisp. My friend had a fillet, again ok but not special. If you want Good go here, if you want Good I would bother, try Hard Rock Cafe over the road!",Bad,,Good
I've been to many gourmet steak houses in my days and this was not worth the price I paid. Service was phony and not sincere. The steak was no better than the average restaurant.  I didn't feel good paying for that meal. I would not go back there.,Bad,Bad,Bad
If steak is what you are seeking this is the place  High end restaurant.  A great place to take business partners for great conversation.  Also family friendly enough to bring children.  Three of us ordered  and main dish and then split several sides.  The portions sizes were just enough and the food and presentation was excellent.,Good,,
"This place is more incredibly disappointing and mediocre than outright awful, although it is awful. Jean Georges owns a famous French restaurant in NYC, so one might think that focusing on one area, steak, would be magical. No. It's dark, gloomy with annoying Muzak, with slow and indifferent service, and the steaks are very expensive and incredibly average. You enter into gigantic impersonal busy Aria and fight your way through a noisy casino, up an escalator past a Starbucks, and find this place ticked into a distant corner. 


Believe the TripAdvisor reviews and go anywhere else. A basic dinner for two was over $300.",Bad,Bad,Bad
I had oysters for an appetizer and scallops for dinner.  It was done well and in a healthy manner.  The Brussel sprouts were delicious and I'd recommend them as a side to any meal.,Good,,
"We've done fancy steak joints before, but this one was top notch.   the atmosphere was intimate and quiet, kinda romantic.  The waitstaff was attentive and efficient.  We ordered the wedge salad.  The dressing is not what you expect for a wedge, but my Husband loved it.  Then we shared a ribeye with a side of crab legs, potatoes and asparagas.  Everything was perfectly prepared and amazingly delicious!   At the end we shared the caramel sundae.  It was so different, with caramel popcorn in it.   We loved it, you have to try it!!",Good,Good,Good
"The steak was of Morton's prices but not in its league - it was fairly dry, so I'm not sure they let it rest.  Menu didn't have lamb.  Service was efficient and good - not a Bad, but I expected better given the prices.",Bad,,Good
"we had the chef's table and had very Good...my filet mignon was well cooked , no complaints ,the NY strip steaks that some of our guests had seemed thinly  cut for a steak house quality..the wine list was good and priced as expected at a steak house( the malbec's were the best deal)",Good,Good,Good
"great steaks and a very nice wine list.  Very enjoyable meal.  If I had one negative thing to say, it was a bit odd to be asked by about 4 or 5 people on wanting to help with the wine list.  It is reasonably large but asking to help before I have even had a chance to look through it was a bit off for me.",Good,Bad,
Ordered soup & salad & Diet Coke. Coke refill is extra. Soup couldn't take more than few spoons doesn't taste good at all. Salad of tomatoes & cheese. Cheese didn't taste good at all. Didn't eat it. Paid too much & left hungry.,Bad,Bad,
Excellent cuisine and beautiful deco.  Drinks are fantastic.  Service is excellent. Pricey but worth it.,Good,Good,Good
Service was not good. We got an in-bone Ribeye and it was 1/2 fat. A little marveling is ok but not like that. Crab was split but ok. Had to call every time we needed something. At the prices they should be over serving.,Bad,,Bad
"We had dinner at the jean George's steak house, atmosphere is great dimmed lighting and great wine selection, server knew their stuff and made our choices easy.  My highlight was wagyu tomahawk. Good stuff!!!",Good,Good,Good
"My partner and l dined here as we were staying at Aria, the steak would have to be one of the best l have ever had. The service was first class and the sommelier knew his stuff. You do expect all of that for the price you are paying.",Good,,Good
"My partner and I had a 3 course meal and were thoroughly impressed with the overall experience.


All staff were exceptionally polite and knowledgable.


The food was superb.


Looking at other reviews, I note some comments regarding the pricing. The menu and prices are displayed prior to entering the restaurant. You enter with this knowledge as we did. While I agree the prices were high, it was fine dining not a neighbourhood steak house. 


The experience was certainly worth the pricing in my opinion. For your information. We spent $360 total for 3 courses for two people. This included alcohol, tax and a ~25% tip. 


5 stars.",Good,Good,Good
I have had the pleasure of eating at Jean Georges on a number of occasions and it NEVER disappoints.  The food is divine and the wait staff well trained and very attentive.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the perfect backdrop for an elegant night out.,Good,Good,Good
went there for the CES show to enjoy steaks. Price are terrible. Steaks are correct but not so great. Wine price is just amazing(there is roughly no wine bottle below $100 !),Bad,,
"This restaurant is expensive but at the same time this is vegas and for the quality and the service it is worthwhile.


For the 2nd trip in a row this was the last restaurant and again the best meal of the trip and in the company of the other restaurants I have visited in Vegas, STK both nobus, Andreas, SW, cut,  various high end Asians, various Italians.


It deserves much more than its ranking in TripAdvisor.


It is a great hybrid between American steaks prepared with a European twist.  And one of the only places that actually cooked the steak as to my request.


The wine list is extensive and can be somewhat challenging.  I stick with Faust and Camus in cab savs as they offer a good return for the money,  you could spend significantly more.  If you are spending less than $100 on a bottle stick with by the glass and take recommendations.


The service is attentive without being obsessive.  The only restaurant that replaced and folded the napkin when I visited the restroom. Will definitely return and with larger groups.",Good,Good,Good
"This is really a fabulous restaurant and one of my favourite in Vegas. Yes it is pricey but so are most of the other places in nice hotels. 
The Kobe Carpaccio for starters was unbelievable. It just melted in my mouth. 
The steak was tasty and comes with some great sauces that can be combined for some great flavours. The truffle macaroni cheese is a must have side. I would stay away from the mushrooms which I can only describe as odd. 


There are lots of comments on trip advisor about the service but it was excellent for us.",Good,Good,Good
Wow great steak. had dinner with a friend. we both thought our steaks were out of this world. I had the Ribeye. Cooked perfect.,Good,,
"This was without a doubt the finest steak restaurant we have ever experienced. The wait staff is superb, starting with our waitress, Seana. We were waited on by two excellent sommeliers, Arnold & Reggie, the master chef, Robert, and were also attended to by Joon the General Manager and Gerti, the Assistant GM. No detail was missed, and no request was too much. Their careful attention to our dining needs and anticipation of our next request made the dinner flow effortlessly. Our waitress was exceedingly well informed on their outstanding menu, which included Wagyu filet mignon as well as Kobe beef. We also sampled their extensive appetizers, as well as bone marrow. Every dish was done to perfection and served at the perfect time and temperature. The table was cleared quietly as we dined so as not to be noticed. The wine list is top drawer, and the dessert menu, should you make it that far, is to die for. If you are not planning a visit to the Aria Hotel, you owe it to yourself to go if for no other reason than to enjoy this fine dining experience.",Good,Good,Good
"A great special occasion place to eat. Good, service and experience. Felt valued as a guest, wasn't rushed at all.",Good,Good,Good
"I was told that this was a great restaurant and I was not let down,  Everything that we ordered was delicious.  I had the filet and it was cooked to perfection.  The butternut squash soup was out of this world.",Good,,
"We always find the steaks in the USA much better than most we get back home so always try to end our visit with a steak meal, Good setting and lighting, loved the d√©cor, good music, excellent steaks plus Good. They have a photographer take your pictures if you want it but they are not pushy if you don't. It was expensive but very good, great last night choice, would recommend.",Good,Good,Good
"A very chic take on a steakhouse that delivers. Several of us ordered the Wagyu filet and it was perfect. The sear was just right - not over charred - and the flavors exceptional. Get the mashed potatoes for sure. Brussels sprouts were quite good. Asparagus fine, but nothing memorable. Great wine list. Foie gras appetizer with fig was perfectly seared.",Good,Good,
We dined here with a few friends on Friday night . We were late for our reservation but they took is anyways. The service was fast and friendly. Appetizers were delicious. We had calamari and carpaccio and some salads . The vine in wagyu was just perfect!! Deserts were also delicious. the cocktails and the wine list were amazing. Try the mule you won't regret it . The only thing we didn't like was a photographer who just popped in and took pictures of us and at the end was pushing the pictures on us. She was very nice and professional I just don't think it was appropriate to surprise you at the end with 100 bucks worth of pictures. Overall if you're in aria or Vegas try this place .,Good,Good,Good
"It is expected that the Steak is amazing, but what you need to know is that the Burger is beyond expectations. I love it.",Good,,
"a show we went to ran over, so we ended up eating dinner super late.  it was our first day in vegas and we were extremely jet lagged.  i provide this context because i am unable to comment on the ambiance which i am sure is incredible.  we were just too out of it to notice. BUT the food we couldn't ignore.  incredible.  we both had cod and it was perfectly cooked/seasoned.  my appetizer soup was perfection and my nibble on the bread was divine.  it will be first on our list the next time we are back in vegas so we can soak up the decor and service.",Good,Good,Good
"The restaurant has a very nice upscale atmosphere. Service was excellent and attentive. The food was disappointing though. We had ordered the JG truffle burger and the scallops. Burger arrived burnt on one side and was bland, couldn't taste the truffle mayonnaise at all, very poor showing for a $28 burger. Truffle fries were excellent.  Scallops were good but slightly overbooked, truffle Mac & cheese was average. Cocktails were very good. With all the excellent restaurants in Vegas I think I'd pick somewhere else.",Bad,Good,Good
A place that cares about its customers in a Vegas hotel. How quaint. Very good steak. Excellent service. Expensive but a value ;,Good,Good,Good
"First of all the restaurant is very nicely done and the atmosphere is great.  Our server was super helpful and very knowable overall.


The appetizers were tremendous, you have to try the calamari and the beef carpaccio.  The steaks are INCREDIBLE and the porterhouse was to die for.


They have greats sides and a fantastic wine selection too.


I would back to Jean George's many many times....",Good,Good,Good
The steak was absolutely exceptional as was everything else about the restaurant including the service. Unfortunately I was flagging with the onset of a cold and didn't get to appreciate everything in as much detail as I was looking forward to. As the title suggests though. I would most definitely return if I'm ever in town again and make sure that I've had sleep beforehand!,Good,Bad,Good
"Ordered bone in ribeye and couldn't eat half of it due to fat/gristle, what I could eat was very average. Nice environment though.",Bad,Good,
"I stumbled into this restaurant several months ago and consider that day one of my luckiest.  I have returned for dinner every month since.


As a single patron who does not drink, I find myself not getting the best service in my restaurants but that was Not the case here.  Instead the staff treated me as family dining in their home.


The service is great but the real treat is the food.  Oh My! Yes, this is a Steakhouse but it is So much more.  Executive Chef, Sean Griffin makes sure of that with his innovative menu selections as well as delicious specials.  The crispy sushi is to die for.


I have Never had a bad meal here--not even one bad dish.


Do yourself a favor and give this place a try.  You will be hooked--I assure you!",Good,Good,Good
We had an amazing steak dinner here. Can't afford a full Kobe meal (it's $55 an ounce). But we share the small 3oz tasting portion and wow....really unforgettable. Main course was a perfectly cooked New York strip with several very original sauces. Washed down with an ultra smooth Malbec. What a treat. Not cheap by any means but totally worth it.,Good,,
"Service was good, but not exceptional.  Food was excellent, but just not that much better than others at half the price. $125 for a Tomahawk steak was  a bit much, but you do get to take the bone home in case you need a club for self defense!",Good,,Good
Jean Georges is a nice escape from all the hustle and bustle of a busy hotel. The atmosphere is very romantic. The wait staff is very friendly but the prices are pretty high!,,Good,Good
Great steak and a great atmosphere. Staff was very nice the steak was perfect.  Wine was suggested by staff and was phenomenal,Good,Good,Good
I must say the service was great and friendly. Our group was in a separate dining area. Great wine selection. The steaks were delicious and prepared per our wellness. They were served with sauces that were interesting but not really needed when then steak was so good alone. The asparagus side dish was good as well. I did not prefer the mashed potatoes. Too whipped for me and lacked some flavor.,Good,,Good
The steaks are very good and come with a wide selection the beer menu is a little disappointing but the wine selection is good,Good,,
My wife and I had dinner here while staying at Aria. the service was great but the food was just average.  I expected a lot better for the price we paid. I've had much better steaks while in Vegas.,Bad,,Good
"A friend and I were looking for a nice steakhouse, the Cosmopolitan recommended  Jean George's.


The food was just okay.  I had the bone-in ribeye with truffle mac and cheese and crunchy potatoes.   The steak came out warm and lacked flavor.  The sides were also warm and okay.  The atmosphere and wine were much better than the food.  I would not go back a second time.",Good,Good,
"I really enjoyed the food and service here.  The ambiance is that of a steakhouse with a little more glitter.  It may sound strange but they had the best mashed potatoes I have ever had.  They also had my favorite wine, Caymus, and I left half a bottle behind.  The starter was perfect as was the steak.....the only issue I had was they sat me at a 2 seater table along the perimeter and the next couple that came in they sat right next to me even though the place was empty... I was so close to then I was forced to participate in their conversation.  There is no reason for that as I was alone and wanted privacy.",Good,Good,Good
"We were not in any kind of hurry but 45 min to get two steaks out I thought was slow. Then I realized that they must have been still frozen.  


 I have never seen a more greasy, black soot covered piece of meat! This representation of a beef ribeye is what I would think a steak from a bear would taste like. Greasy, tough and not what good cow taste like. Just a couple minutes and i knew this was going to require a trip to the bathroom.
 And how in the heck do you mess up mushrooms!? Or a cesars salid. What I received looked like it came from subway. Machine shredded so small I could have seriously  used a spoon  to eat it.


 I do want to thank you making my next dinner decision a little bit easier. Now knowing I can not get a good steak in this hotel.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Our party had excellent service and food. I don't usually dine in this type of upscale restaurant and it proved to be an enjoyable experience. My filet mignon was mouth watering. The restaurant itself was very modern and artsy adding to the experience.,Good,Good,Good
"Everything about this place is just right, the circular bar with excellent bar tenders, Gary in particular, is just excellent, we ate at the bar and although pricey, it is top, top end quality food, as good as anywhere in Vegas, but so it should be for the price.",Good,Good,Good
"The experience myself and seven others had at this restaurant was extremely disappointing especially being our first night in Las Vegas. We had to wait over an hour to be served our meals, the vegetables and fries were all cold, some people received the incorrect dish one other had a very expensive steak that could hardly be cut  with a knife, chicken that was cold and another chicken dish that was tough. When you are paying the prices that this restaurant are charging the service and food should be impeccable. We were all very disappointed and would advise others to definitely not go to this restaurant.",Bad,Bad,Bad
We went on a business trip and the food was amazing but prices were very steep. I would eat there anytime if paid for.,Good,,
"One of the three certified Kobe Steak Restaurants in Las Vegas.  Ten or less restaurants in US certified Kobe Steak restaurants and Las Vegas is home to 3.  This is one of two that I went to.


They have a vast wine menu with many choices by the glass.  I started with a glass of 2012 Darioush.  Typical napa cabernet, fruit forward, oaky, leathery, and smooth tannins.  Just the way I like it.  I went expensive because I was planning to have a Kobe steak.


The bartender, Gary brought me into the kitchen so I could have a look at the Kobe striploin.  It was graded A5 in marbling which is mostly white flecks with small amounts of red flecks.  The Kobe steak had a small sinew line running through so I declined.  I asked how the bone-in Wagu dryaged striploin was? I got to see my cut of beef but very lean A2 marbling.   I wanted to see how a dry aged taste like.


I ordered truffle mashed potatoes and the steak cooked med.  The steak came out perfectly cooked.  The taste was very nice 9.5/10 and temperature fine 10/10.  The texture was slightly stiff.8.5/10   The mashed potatoes were delicious.


Finally, I had the panna cotta and dbl espresso.  9/10  Refreshing and light.  Service 10/10  Thank you for letting dine in the bar with shorts on!.... very customer oriented.


Very expensive so make this your night out or a special occasion night.",Good,,
I am a short rib fanatic! These were very good and had a unique soy glaze with apple. Really differebt take but it totally worked. Service impeccable.,Good,,Good
"Four of us visited Jean Georges Steakhouse for a family dinner on Saturday as my brother was visiting from England.  Booked for 7.30pm and were seated on the dot.


Service was fantastic.  Our server looked after us, was attentive, very knowledgeable, friendly and professional.  When she wasn't around one of her colleagues would check in on us, top up the wine and generally make sure we were taken care of.  Very good teamwork!


The food is absolutely first class.  Three of us had steaks, and one had the burger,  All were amazing.  The steaks were cooked to perfection.  The sauces all went well with the meat, and the sides were excellent as well (especially the mac & cheese, the crispy potatoes and the trumpet mushrooms).  We even managed a couple of desserts to share and they were well presented, and tasted delicious.


Two of us shared a bottle of Justin's Isosceles and it was a good pairing for the steak.  The Sin City IPA met with my brother's approval as well.


This is not a cheap restaurant.  For four of us, including the tip, it came to a little over $600 but it was worth every penny with all of us saying it was probably one of the best meals we'd ever had.  As I said in the title, it really was simply superb.",Good,Good,Good
"Made a reservation for 6 with high expectations... They totally lived up to it. Started with a couple bottles of wine. They boast aMillion dollar wine wall. A shared appetizer of seafood for 4....enough for 6+.  Then entrees and a few sides. Sides are also shareable. Fantastic! Service...impeccable! But, it is not cheap!!! This was a celebration so knew wha I was getting into...",Good,Good,Good
"I am a service fanatic. From the entrance to the waiters everybody was amazing.  He quality if the fiod was great, I had the 18oz steak and enjoyed it from the moment it was put in front of me. We also had the Tuna Tartare and it was magninficent. It's a little pricey but the atmosphere and quality are second to none. Great dinner!",Good,Good,Good
"We went here with a large group and had a great evening, the food was excellent - great steaks (had the wagyu); nice appies and deserts as well. The service while friendly and attentive, was pretty slow - not very good considering the price.",Good,,Bad
"Amazing meat, fantastic venue In the best hotel of Vegas 
A bit expensive of course 
But great service 
Top notch place for sure
The rapper future Was Also There When we went",Good,Good,Good
"I have no issues paying top $$$$ for Good but would expect top service to go with it. 


I have been to a lot of the best restaurants in London and never had such poor service. 


Service was slow, one of the sides was cold and it generally felt liked they were over worked even though the place was empty. 


The food was good and the steak was amazing although avoid the fries m. Macdonalds style and taste for $18 is to high. Not sure where they are sourcing their potatoes from but maybe find a cheaper supply and pass on ten discount or at least up your game for the money and serve better fries. 


Over all there are better places to get a steak with better service. 


This does seem to be a theme with the whole hotel. Good idea but bad execution.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Business dinner with a lot of the little extra!! We were all taken with the quality of the steaks and I have to say this was a very impressive serving. Pricewise on the highside, but worth it to the penny. Well done guys!!",Good,Good,
"Excellent food and service in a beautiful room. 


Steaks are to die for! Extensive Wine List. 


We entertained 21 guests all thought food was fabulous. 


A bit on the prices side but worth it!",Good,Good,Good
"The food here was good but the service for a high end restaurant is lacking. We had to ask multiple times for accompaniments to the bread that they offer. 


The cocktails were very average considering that they are $16 each. 


Overall an average experience but great food.",Good,,Bad
"Four of us ate there last week. I ordered shrimp which was delicious. Everyone else had steaks, all said they were fabulous - even to the point that the 2 men said theirs was the best they'd ever had.",Good,,Bad
Went with my wife and truly was a special meal. Had the New York Strip steak. High cost but worth every penny!,Good,Good,
"Newly opened since our last visit to Vegas, we were seated quickly and given a nice cozy, romantic table. Since the menu was so tempting, we ordered a lot to taste. However, we didn't understand the portions were to share. The service was fantastic - and we enjoyed every bite (even the leftovers since we could not finish it all in one sitting). And the restrooms are uniquely designed - fashionable for a restroom :)",Good,Good,Good
"I wont lie to you, I was expecting something more.  The restaurant itself is very nice and the service is great.  Its just that there was no WOW factor that I could actually tell you makes this steakhouse better than any other.  We did have a private room and some in our party felt like the waiter sometimes forgot about us.  And yes maybe a little too dark.",,Bad,Good
"The service was on point, very attentive. Comprehensive wine list and decadent dinner selections making it hard to chose between items. The steak was perfectly cooked and the black truffle macaroni and cheese was delicious. There was a sales person offering photography and prints but was courteous when we declined. I would return to try more menu items on my next visit. My husband loved this birthday dinner experience, a real treat to be enjoyed! Ont a vraiment aimer!",Good,Good,Good
Steaks and seafood were prepared to perfection. Our server was extremely professional and his attention to detail added to the ambiance of the evening. A definite must visit if you're prepared for an exquisite and expensive evening.,Good,Good,Good
"We went there as a very large group to celebrate a few birthdays. We had a private room which did look amazing, although maybe a little too dark.


The food was really nice. It has to be the best steaks we have ever had but it won't come cheap. We knew the prices before we went so we were happy with it but do check before you go as a steak by itself starts at $56 and sides are from $14 each!


Our biggest let down was the service. Only one waitress for a big group. She was not ready for us and did not have the correct logic or understanding of our party.
I kept being given food that was not mine, sides were served way after the steaks ... had to ask for my drinks a couple of times.


So yes do go if you want Good but be prepared to pay a large bill!",Good,Good,Bad
Dinner of a lifetime....presentation of bone marrow was the best...have no words to describe the excellent taste of everything we ordered and the impeccable service they provided....,Good,Good,Good
"We recently ate at this steakhouse at the recommendation of a close friend. For the amount of money we paid I felt the food was average and the service was not close to my expectations of a $500 dollar joint. The ambiance was great, great bread, food average, and poor bar service. The waiter was average and didn't appear engaged in his table. My wife's steak was over cooked and the mushroom ala cart side was chewy. Highly recommend the truffle Mac n cheese however!  Would not return.",Bad,Good,Bad
"Jean Georges knows steaks and they are AMAZING!  We came here for a couple of our friends birthdays and they did not disappoint.  First note, it's not cheap and you cannot come here expecting to find anything on a budget.  If you are willing to get over this and realize it from the gate, it is going to be the experience you want it to be!  
There are myriad apps you should dig into before the main meal.  We had tuna tar tar, beef carpaccio, bread that was amazing (especially with the tar tar), sushi and more.  Here is a quick warning, don't fill up too much on the apps because the steak is coming and boy you want to save room!  I personally had the rib eye and it was amazing!  You need, yes, need to pair it with the Chimichurri sauce.  They bring it for a reason, it brings out a flavor in the meat like you wouldn't believe!  My buddy had the wagyu and it was so good!  I also heard the burger is mind blowing as well.  I hate to say this, but from time to time I like going to high end steak houses and getting a burger to blow your mind!
If you are in vegas and want a place to blow the top of your culinary skull off, go to Jean Georges!",Good,Good,
"Really wanted a cheeseburger, and when the bartender said theirs was the best he'd eaten, my mind was made up.... Only, it was just ok... Slightly frou-frou, but unimpressive nonetheless.... Oh well...",Bad,,
"I love the steakhouse. They have amazing food, great staff and lovely sides. The only thing is that it is a bit prices. It is totally worth it though. I would joyfully come here again.",Good,Good,Good
Although the steaks are great there is an Asian infusion in the food pp and was for me.  The atmosphere is amazing.  However it was really over priced.  I have had better for less but I'm from New York.,Bad,Good,
"We were looking for a steak restaurant for the evening and we stumbled upon Jean Georges steak house at the Aria and decided to give it a go and I'm glad we did. 


We had the Calamari to start which in my opinion were just ok. Being Italian I except the calamari to be a little less salty and a lot more crunchy. It was a little bit soggy for my liking and had to many spices in my opinion but to each they're own. 


For my main I had the 18 oz bone in rib eye cooked medium rare along with a chimichuri sauce and my business associate had the lobster tail. My steak was cooked to perfection. I must say this steak rates right up there as one of best steaks I've had. Every piece was as succulent as the next and I think I may have shed a tear when I realized I was done. It felt like I could have just kept eating it was that good. Great job Jean Georges!


I did not try the lobster but as you can see in the picture attached it looks pretty delicious as well and I got good reviews from my business associate. 


The only draw back for me and the reason this restaurant doesn't get 5 stars is that I felt the restaurant to be very dark. To the point where at times I would need the light from my phone to see the menu. 


Wait staff were great. Very friendly and attentive. 


This restaurant does come at a price though. Definitely on the higher end of restaurants in the city. Maybe not the most expensive but my pockets were a lot lighter when I left. 


All in all it was great experience and I hope to be back in the near future.",Good,Bad,Good
"We had the best dinner we ever had in Las Vegas and we have been going 3 or 4 times a year for over 20 years. Steaks were fabulous. I had a filet and my wife had the NY Strip, both were the best either of us ever had. A little pricey but worth every penny.",Good,Good,
"My wife and I were in Las Vegas at the Aria and wanted to go someplace very nice to officially celebrate our anniversary. We dressed up (I was only one of maybe a couple men wearing a tie in there) and had champagne and steaks. We both at the Wagyu steaks which were awesome. The waiters were very helpful and friendly. The steak was great without all the different sauces they bring out with them, but the sauces were a great compliment to the steaks. We skipped desert and had something later downstairs at pastry caf√©. My only issue was the website advertises a tasting menu that we were told they do not have anymore. I want to go back next time I am in town.",Good,,Good
"Positives out of the way first...


The food is excellent, and that is the prime thing!
The wine was excellent, with a good selection. 


So the reasons for not giving this a 5 star rating:- 


The main reason was the service. I don't mind formal &  professional service ( Buddha Bar in Dubai is a great example of this); but the primary service staff were simply disengaged in JG..their priority was noticeably  to get you in and out as quickly as possible, with a total lack of warmth in the service...that's criminal when you are paying over  $200 a head...
The actual service staff did try to engage and were shot down audibly by more senior employees/ management.  What a pity as the older gentleman serving us was, if given the opportunity, a warm character. 


The second reason was even more surprising. A lack of basic table etiquette...cutlery not positioned correctly; wine not opened and offered as tasting before fully poured..again those incidents were by a staff member in more authority, who didn't respect the job he was supposed to provide...


The ambiance of the night was ruined by the attitude of the team...what a pity, as I will repeat that the food and drink quality was excellent...
They should however take a long look at the attitude and attention to detail of the team from top to bottom if they want to deliver the 5 star experience that the food deserves...",Good,Good,Bad
"Yeah yeah I know, Im that guy who doesnt eat steak in a steakhouse which is why I was genuinely surprised at how much I enjoyed my dinner at JeanGeorge. If I can twist anyone's arm to stray away from the beef it would be here. Shrimp appetizer, scallops and squash, and cheesecake. The restaurant is loud and huge so dont expect a formal kind of experience. Price is $$$$.",Good,Bad,
"During a recent stay at Aria, I had the pleasure of dinning at Jean Georges Steakhouse, what an excellent experience, fantastic service, amazing menu, premium dinning choices. I had the traditional Surf and Turf, Filet Mignon and Lobster tail with a loaded bake potato - which was fantastic! During my next visit to Las Vegas in November I will definitely be dinning at Jean George Steakhouse!! See you in November...",Good,Good,Good
"First, let me say I pay for and expect quality. I ve enjoyed Jean Georges restaurants in NY and Hong Kong. Read my reviews, I travel often and enjoy fine restaurants frequently. The restaurant is nice. The staff is pleasant enough, yet I detectable and air of arrogance, may be because this was Jean Georges Steakhouse. The menu has something fopr everyone, but I found the food quality, while good, nowhere near world class. I ordered the Fois Gras, somewhat bland. How can fatty duck liver be bland? Our Filets were of decent quality. We split a large lobster tail to accompany our steaks, also only average. The sauces on the side were nice, if not very good. The desert was also pretty decent. I found the wine list to my liking with a nice bottle of Pahlmeyer at a very good price. Some sauterne with desert finish our visit. An okay meal cost a little north of $500.00. I go back to Alize before I attempt another meal here. Simply not world class.",Bad,,
"The food at this restaurant was good, albeit a prix fixe menu for a wedding dinner consisting of 50-60 out of town guests.  And they do have a nice wine list, if the waitstaff would have come back to take the order, after leaving us with the list..... However, the service was horrible, especially the elderly male waitstaff...didn't get his name.  If you don't want to work a group function, call in sick.  BTW, the restaurant was empty as they booked this dinner upon opening at 5:30pm.  I feel bad for my cousin and his wife, who love the Aria.  The Aria's Wedding Chapel was a beautiful experience.  Too bad, the restaurant couldn't continue the warm, fuzzy feelings.",,Bad,Bad
"I really wanted to like Jean Georges, especially since I like the other restaurant, Prime at Bellagio. Unfortunately, Jean Georges is not in that same category. Service is terrible for a fine dining restaurant. You will find yourself waiting an inordinate length of time to be served.  The food quality does not match to the high pricing.  With all of the great steak places to choose from in Las Vegas, you can do better than this place.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Everything was 100%. Service was top class. They gave us a complimentary dessert when they found out we were on our honeymoon. We will definitely visit again.,Good,Good,Good
"Been to a couple of Jean Georges restaurants, and never disappointed, its expensive but it is worth every penny, really recommended, staff is extremely friendly and savvy.",,Good,Good
"The food is very pricey but so worth it for a splurge.   My friend chose the filet--it was a large portion and cooked perfectly. I chose the chicken served over spinach with a lemon jalape√±o glaze--it was wonderful.  I also chose the salad of the day. Which was butter lettuce with peaches, nuts and feta topped with a peach balsamic dressing.  It was perfect.",Good,,
We had an amazing experience last night for dinner. The 8 ounces filet mignon was perfectly medium cocked and perfectly seasoned. Service was great and the setting is very nice and classy as well. One of my coworkers had her filet overlooked and when she called the waitress she apologized so many times and brought another perfect filet in few minutes. Plus she gave complementary dessert. I would definitely go back.,Good,Good,Good
These have the best steaks of any steak house I have ever visited! Great bone-in rib eyes accompanied by 5 unique sauces. And the Caesar salad is fantastic classic not 'redone' in a new variation.,Good,,
"There are lots of great steakhouses in Vegas. You can add another to the list with Jean Georges. 


I started with Bibb Lettuce Salad which was delicious. 


Then came the steak. I had the 12 oz. New York Strip perfectly cooked well-done. Delivered with 4 sauces. Of the four I preferred the hot habanero sauce. The sides were also lick-the-serving-spoon delectable. The creamed corn was obviously roasted and trimmed from the cob in their kitchen. The garlic mashed was more buttery-emulsified, but as I said, lick that serving spoon. 


I read a few reviews that said it was pricy, but what fine steakhouse isn't.  


All I can say is you get what you pay for and I thought it was worth every cent. Give it a try when in Vegas.",Good,,
"Very Disappointing considering reputation. Really looked forward to an experience with a 3 star chef . Would never return or recommend . Took one if my important and discerning customers. I was embarrassed. 
Main course over seasoned - all I could taste was salt - the only edible  dish of creamed corn was lovely - crispy potatoes must have been 5 days old - not crispy or nice just old and tasteless - left my main course as unpalatable left the potatoes. 
Kobe steak was ok. Just ok . Had better in gauchos Not memorable at all. 
Didn't come here to complain - just wanted great food - didn't get that. Happy to pay good money for Good . Paid good money $373 for two for less than average food.",Bad,Bad,
"My wife and I were invited as guests to go to this steak house. We are two couples who are into food and wine. We are locals but our hosts were visiting from LA.


We were seated promptly and since I am the wine ""expert,"" I was given the wine list to select the wine.


I was told money was no object and to pick whatever I wanted. Our waitress offered to have the sommelier help us but I declined and chose one of my reasonably priced favorites.


Unfortunately Tripadvisor does not break down the rating enough. So I am going to do it with my own rating of 1-10 with 10 being the highest as follows:


Overall appearance: 5
Food server: 6
Food quality: 6
Wine selection: 7


Overall rating considering cost: 5
Overall rating not considering cost: 6


Why the low rating? For a restaurant of this class inside perhaps one of the top 5 hotels in Las Vegas, at the cost of almost $900 for dinner for four I expected more. When you go to a top restaurant, it is about the overall experience. Here is what did it for me. They sat us at two short tables pushed together to make it longer. The tables were uneven to the tune of being off (up and down) by almost an inch at the joints. There were no table cloth covers of any description to cover the surface of the table. 
Here is the deal breaker, the formica surface of the table was peeling as if it had a severe sunburn. I noticed it from the get go but was too embarressed to point it out to our host. I have been to IHOP restaurants for a $10 meal that had much nicer tables. For a restaurant of this class and cost, that is totally unacceptable.


Would I go back? Why would I? I can go to an off-strip steakhouse near our house and get better food, better service, far better look and touch, for less than 1/3 of the cost. We ventured onto the strip, and we are not going back. What a shame. I had such high hopes.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Really helpful waiters, amazing steak whichever one you decide on. Can be very expensive if you push the boat out.",Good,,Good
Dark and foreboding atmosphere. Great for impressing business clients. Prices will knock your socks off. Food quality matches prices - was not disappointed. Servers all knew their stuff.,Good,Good,Good
"Very nice romantic atmosphere, good selection of drinks, limited dinning options. Steak is incredible, and service to back things up. Great place to relax, and plan your evening",Good,Good,Good
"There is a reason this place has been open day 1 of Aria's opening.  It's fantastic! We had oysters, shrimp, and steak tartare for appetizers.  Nothing was too salty or overcooked.  They were fantastic.  Then for entrees we had filet mignon, salmon and some other fish I can't remember, and we were wowed!!  I will absolutely be back here.",Good,Good,
"There are no words to describe the excellence of this meal! Prime cuts of amazing quality steaks including rare Wagyu cuts!  The prices as you can imagine also matched the excellence of the meal, but I was ok with that as it was a special occasion.  Tried the tuna and carpaccio appetizers as well as the burratta as a second cours.  Had the filet for dinner which had great flavor and a buddy had the short rib which was phenomenal.  For sides you have to get the truffle mac and cheese!  I could have had this as a meal it was soooo good!  If anything was off during this meal, it was the service.  We arrived at our reservation time to a pretty empty restaurant only to be told to go to the bar that our table wasn't ready...secondly the service at the table while good seemed rushed.  When your at a place like this you wantntomtake you time and enjoy it, and at times it felt like the meal could have been paced slower.  I would still recommend going though as the food made up for everything.",Good,,Bad
Very impressed with the food and the service.  This is definitely top notch restaurant and that is why the prices are very high.  The steaks and seafood were all very good so you can't go wrong with either one.,Good,Good,Good
I have eaten at many top steakhouses and Jean Georges' Fillet Oscar beat them all. The lobster tail was huge and the appetizers and sides were also perfect. Service was what you would expect for what you are paying. Will be going back next time I am in Vegas.,Good,,Good
"We read good reviews and love steak so booked a table. The waitress was very friendly and informative and did apologize when the gin selection did not match my expectation however the Cosmo was quite good. The wine selection focuses on American wine unless you are willing to overpay for a French or Italian. We had an Oregon pinot noir which was decent but still $56 for the half bottle. The sommelier did serve the wine but did not speak about it nor open the bottle in front of us at our table. 
We shared Burrata and the kitchen split the appetizer before serving us which was a special touch but the burrata was medicore and could have been mozzarella as it was missing the signature burrata knot. 
We had the US beef special chateaubriand on the bone and it was delicious - perfectly cooked to medium and perfectly spiced. Luckily the beef was delicious without sauces as the sauces all had an Asian touch and the Bernaise was quite spicy and sour.
The creamed spinach was bland and the fries was not edible (hard and over cooked). The waitress changed the fries for mash potatoes but even those were overly salty and oily.
Athough we were offered dessert on the house, we skipped it to avoid further disappointment.
For $350 for a dinner for 2, it was quite expensive and I would not go back. There are restaurants at the same price level which are better. If you want a classic steakhouse don't go here.",Bad,Bad,Good
"Excellent food, excellent service. Theyre always full so you need reservations. We Tried dropping by without reservations and ended up eating at the bar. Still the same excellent service as when we were seated at the table. The steak was pricey but good.",Good,,Good
We went several years ago on the first night of our anniversary trip. My husband had a lobster dish he didn't care for and I had the tasting dinner. The tasting dinner was amazing. It included the short rib at the time and my husband fell in love with it. So much so that he talked about it for the 2 years till we went back (this May). He finally got more short rib and he was so happy. And yes he is still talking about his favorite short rib. Plus our server was great the fist time and even though we didn't have him the second time we had him come over and made sure everything was special for our anniversary dinner... They even gave us a free dessert. One of our Vegas favorites for sure.,Good,Good,Good
"If you love a steakhouse, this is your new heaven.  The food at Jean Georges was as good as it gets in Vegas.  The steak is out of this world and the side dishes are worth the trip by themselves.  This is NOT an inexpensive restaurant.  But, if you are ready to treat yourself to one of Vegas' best dining experiences ... Jean Georges Steakhouse is for you!",Good,Good,
well this is it - Kissed and gone to heaven if you love your meat - amazing service all the staff were on the ball and Knew exactly what was going on - Few issues - Too dark can't read the menu and the wine list mmmmmm crazy stupid - way too many choices maybe they need 2 - one for the wine wankers and one for the simple wine drinkers - I had a nervous breakdown reading it !,Good,Bad,Good
"We were invited to this restaurant with business associates. This hotel grounds are beautiful and this restaurant is stunning in design. I ordered a lemon drop martini, and was quite disappointed and really surprised! The meal was very tasty, quite pricey though, which was expected really. The service was substandard . They actually had us sitting at the table for 1/2 hour before they even took our order or brought us drinks. I was again surprised, as were the others. The place only had 5 other tables filled, it was a Wednesday night, so I don't know what caused the delays . However, one of the steaks came out over cooked, and they replaced it quickly, and then gave free dessert to the table. That was their saving grace. I would go back again, I think we just caught them on an off night.",Good,Good,Bad
"My husband and I celebrated two nights worth of dining, one for our wedding anniversary and the second for my birthday and needless to say we love this restaurant! 
The service is great, with impeccable attention to detail, making you feel very welcome.
The menu caters well for gluten free (which I am) and the options were plentiful.
We opted for steak and lobster which was well cooked to our liking, with a nice assortment of sauces. 
The wine selection was fantastic and the ginger mule cocktail were my my favourite! 
We'll always one back!",Good,Good,Good
"As the Aria buffet still had a bit of a lineup/wait, I decided to ditch the line and find an alternative restaurant for my dinner. I wandered around until I came across Jean Georges, and having read some of the reviews prior to my trip ‚Äì decided I should give it a try. I chose to eat at the bar so to eliminate the wait for a table. I ordered the 13oz NY Strip Steak, well done. I received great service as the bartender was polite, attentive, and even kept me updated as to the ‚Äúprogress‚Äù of my meal. Moreover, he even brought out multiple sauces with my dish so I could try them all. After the first few bites, I was convinced this was the best steak that I‚Äôve ever had, and my new favorite in Vegas! Despite the plethora of dining options in Vegas, I will definitely be returning during my next stay in town. The most memorable part of the meal was by far the customer service, at Jean Georges I felt appreciated and everyone I encountered was attentive.",Good,,Good
"I was in Vegas and thought I'd treat myself to a steak dinner.  I sat at the bar as I often do when traveling solo.  The first thing I noticed was that the bartender was not very attentive given the calibre of the restaurant.  He seemed more concerned with watching the ball game on tv than ensuring his guests were well served.


After a drink I ordered a steak - a NY strip for $54 and a side of asparagus for $16.  (I asked if he might consider a half order of asparagus just for myself but he wouldn't even ask if it was possible).  After a very long wait my dinner arrived - luke warm.  I ate the steak because I couldn't wait for a re-do.  It was an exquisite piece of beef that would have been amazing if it was actually hot.  Oh, and the full order of asparagus I was forced to order?  Luke warm and limp.  I asked to speak with the manager and she was virtually unapologetic.  Apparently the fact that I had eaten the steak was proof that there was no problem.  In the end she comped my glass of wine but left me with the feeling that she really didn't care.


Any restaurant can have an off night but this place, with its very steep prices and iconic brand, should at least be more accountable for a Bad.  If you're looking for a good steak dinner in vegas I've got to suggest that you give this place a pass and find one of the other excellent steakhouses that take service more seriously.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Incredibly underwhelming .  Four of us dined this past weekend.  No one was raving.


Bread basket and martinis were excellent. Wine list is wonderful.  We should have stopped there.


Pea soup is light on flavor but lovely presentation. Three grain salad was very good, but not anything new.


Chilean sea bass was salty and, quite honestly, eh. Capital Grille does a much better sea bass.  Porterhouse steak was good, is not more than a bi mooing for medium rare.  NY Strip didn't wow with flavor.  I can see why they offer four various steak sauces/enhancements.  Personally, prefer a well aged or steak with a good rub than hidden under sauces.


Prices are to be expected...high.  Food did not impress enough for me to return.  Perhaps sit at the bar and try a Wagyu burger ...",Bad,Bad,
"Two steaks and 4 glasses of wine = $300. Very good, but not worth the price.  In line with the rest of the resort, feels like you're being ripped off every time they have an opportunity.",Bad,,
"My friends and I were so anxious to try this restaurant. Our reservation was for 9pm, we did not get our food until close to 11 PM, who eats that late. As delicious as the food was, it was definitely not worth the wait. I won't be going back for sure",Good,Bad,
food was great - had the three course menue with wine paring. service needs some more training in service skills and handling wine.,Good,,Bad
"Nice Devore and atmosphere.  Food very good,   Service , not so great.   Timing was off ,  dirty plates not cleared,  missed bringing us a side and blamed the kitchen-  really the server takes your order and does not deliver with accuracy.  When we told her we did not get it, 15 minutes later it had still not arrived.  Probably will not be our choice to return.",Good,Good,Bad
"We just love this steak restaurant. We had been in Jean Georges in New York but Its totally different experience. Both Fantastic.
It is a most restaurant when you are in Las Vegas.",,Good,
"Very Good and service, would definitely recommend! The food was typical steakhouse prices, but the drinks seemed slightly overpriced.",Good,,Good
"Date night for two at Aria and decided to visit Jean Georges Steakhouse.  The service, setting and food was first class.  Went for Chilled Seafood Platter and bacon wrapped shrimps for starter, mains were Tomahawk Bone in Rib Eye with Scallops as a side plus Free Range Chicken  Tempura style.  Expensive but worth every cent.",Good,Good,Good
"After reading reviews I was very concerned I had made the right choice for my boyfriends birthday meal, but decided to give it a shot.


Firstly the service was amazing - could only fault that the side of shrimp was initially forgotten but seeing as we only remembered half way through they brought it out ASAP and couldn't be more apologetic. The waitress, I think her name was Rachel was fantastic - as we're all of the staff we met on that shift, no one could have been more helpful.


The food was incredible, I went for the NY strip, partner has the wagyu fillet and we could not fault it. The choice of sauces were good and the sides of asparagus and mash both cooked well and tasted great.


The cocktails were lovely and so was the wine.


Once they were aware of my partners birthday they arranged a complimentary birthday dessert, which again was lovely!


With regards to the cost we were both pleasantly surprised having eaten in many steak houses and paid a lot more for worse food.


The restaurant it self was beautifully decorated and would highly recommend to anyone staying in Vegas for a special occasion.",Good,Good,
"First of all skip the wagyu and kobe beef, overpriced and nowhere near the quality I have had at other places.  Like everything in vegas way over priced.  I sent the wagyu back and ordered the 12oz ny strip, they cooked it very nice but poorly seasoned.  All the sides are extra and pricey.  The sauces they serve with the steaks are good.",Bad,,
"First time at this restaurant and booked at the last minute. Service was very good. Food left much to be desired. Steaks were overlooked and Salmon was swimming in butter. The lobster mashed potatoes should have been drained before being presented at the table.  Wine selection was good.  The only redeeming virtue was the attentiveness of the staff.  
Would definitely NOT go here again.",Bad,,Good
Very nice area and seats. Maybe a little bit too dark. Very nice menu and choices of meat and sides. We took the filet mignon 8oz - perfectly cooked as we asked. All sauces on the table. Largely sufficient. We took as a side French fries and truffled mashed potatoes it was delicious. Really nice address for steakhouse in Vegas - expensive as for this quality!,Good,,
"An overbearing waitstaff  and mediocre food for a fortune my friends ordered  the $160.00 porterhouse , ok not spectacular , my veal hop Milanese was a disaster , three small fried pieces if veal amongst a huge pile of arugula and tomatoes, for 45.00 , the buffet for $13.99 would have looked and tasted the same if not better.No salt on the table? how pretentious......",Bad,,Bad
"My husband and Son-in-law had a great meal recently so my husband was very exited to take me there, unfortunately it was not a Good, service was very slow and the Steaks cooked @ wrong temperature, the manager was very apologetic and din not charge for the steaks never the less it ruined the evening.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Stayed at the Aria at beginning of May and chose the Steakhouse for our final meal.  Had looked at the menu outside before we booked and thought it looked fine perhaps a little pricey but to be expected for Kobe or Wagu beef.  Taken straight to our table before we were offered drinks.  Waitress was good offering advice on food and other half took her recommendation of a wagu ribeye at $125 plus lobster at $60.  I was a little more conservative at my Australian steak for $67.  This did not include the sides that added another $70.  For starter hubby had the oyster selection and I had the prawn cocktail.  My starter was disappointing as it consisted of 4 prawns on a bed of ice with two extra hot dips.  Not very interesting at all, without the dips the prawns had not taste at.  They were putting our main course plates down as they took away the starter plates that we had just finished.  The steaks were Ok but not the gourmet experience we were expecting.  Fortunately I had chosen a nice Zinfandel that helped to numb the shock of $550 bill.  Anyone dining here, unless money is no object, should take care when selecting their choices.",Bad,Bad,
"Food was delicious, very expensive for portion size, etc., but still delicious. We had an issue with our reservation, my online confirmation said 8:30 but the restaurant had down 8:00. We arrived close to 8:30 and were told snottily that we missed our reservation, however they did seat us. Our waiter was very nice and personable. The restaurant is very dark inside but it has a cool atmosphere. For four people our bill was around $600.00. The food was very good, but be prepared to pay for it.",Good,Good,Good
"I gave this place 2 stars bc our was on waiter & bread/ butter were game - waiter was prompt, had great attitude and cute. :)


--The food - I had the strip my husband had the bone in aged strip his was much much better than my steak I've been to Lugers, smith& wollenski, Mastros, mortons, Chicago cut, wolfgangs, sparks, Bobby vans, blt steak, keens, Ruth Chris, the Palm,could go on...... So I know my steaks 


I did not like my steak- it just was not good no flavor just blah
My sides were horrible I sent back my mushroom bc they were so chewy & old just no flavor yuck!
Saut√©ed spinach was blah too no flavor
My extra dirty martini came in not a ""martini"" glass but a French themed glass for girly drinks ( which I love w champagne) and my martini was not extra dirty however my Olives were good


Overall, I had a nice time w date- the husband :)
But the food is just not comparable to other steakhouses spend your $300 elsewhere",Bad,,Good
"This was a nice night out but be prepared to pay, the prices are high the service was excellent. The steak was cooked to perfection.",Good,,Good
"During my  recent stay at the Aria Resort and Casino my boyfriend and I decided to dine at Jean Georges Steakhouse and we could not be happier with our decision! We did have a reservation so we were seated immediately and greeted promptly by a very friendly hostess. We felt very well taken care of by several staff. While the service was fantastic the real treat was the food. I ordered the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and asparagus and my boyfriend had the Chilean sea bass. Both our meals were absolute perfection! Every bite was amazing. I highly recommend you make a trip to John Georges Steakhouse on your next visit to Las Vegas. Even if you are a seafood lover as is my boyfriend, I know that you will be 100% happy with your meal.  He travels all over the world and eats seafood all the time and thought it was the best he had ever had! Not bad for a steakhouse!  My  filet was cooked to perfection and the most tender and flavorful I think I have ever had. The mash potatoes were also the best I've ever had.",Good,Good,Good
Good atmosphere... good sides. Very expensive.  Desert was good too. close to the hotel ... Good.,Good,Good,Good
Wonderful service-great food-the deserts are fabulous-dining companions ordered steak-I ordered the Salmon-all were cooked to perfection.,Good,,Good
"As you would expect inside a chic modern hotel, this steakhouse doesn't disappoint.  Menu is terrific for a high-end steakhouse.  Service was good and the food was even better!",Good,Good,Good
"I hosted a business event at Jean Georges, it was a great experience all around, meeting the Chef seeing the kitchen was also fantastic. Every element from arrival to departure 5 star. The steak was amazing.",Good,Good,Good
"As the wife of an Argentine - we eat a lot of meat. A LOT. So when we go out, I don't normally eat beef. Plus I usually don't have nice things to say about other well-known steak houses, that deliver gas-infused steaks on sizzling plates....However, this steak house really prepares a good meal and is worth every penny.  Tasty, and the correct temperature so you can enjoy the flavors.  Winner!",Good,Good,
"All you'd expect from a high end Steak-House is here at Jean Georges. Top cuts of meat, fine wines, fresh seafood. The staff are very attentive, The only reason for a 4 rather than 5 star rating is due to the fact that although our meal was very good, we have enjoyed equal if not better steak in Toronto at a much lower price..",Good,,Good
"Sides don't even come with a 60 dollar steak, but still super tasty.  Lobster mashed potatoes were so good",Good,,
"I can not believe that the dinner was so bad.  I had very high expectations; but unfortunately the steak and sides were just very bland.  I was told that the sauces for the steak were very ""tasty"".  However, I personally prefer my steak as God intended; naked.  I would recommend going to Golden Corral for a better steak.",Bad,Bad,
"If you like a good steak, this place is number one. Best steak I have ever had. Seriously Share the tomahawk steak (off the menu) and w-o-w!! Sit at the bar for an excellent meal.",Good,Good,
"I made the reservation based on the hyped advertisement on the Aria website.  Totally not worth it.  It was extremely pricy and the food was really just so so.  My husband ordered a surf and turf, the entry itself cost more than $100 and it came with the lobster way overcooked (they overbooked it).  I ordered a organic chicken, but it came dry and oily.  Mash potato was the best and let me tell you the secret, lots of butter in it.  On top of everything, I ordered two glasses of Pinot for $18 each. On the final bill, I saw a charge of wine for $30 each.  When I inquired, he brought me a wine list which was totally different from the glass wine menu we were presented at the time of ordering.  He turned to the glassed wine page in a very snobbish way.  True, what I ordered was not on the menu.  So I told him the menu I ordered from was a different one.  Minutes later, he came back with the bar menu (I guess) and said casually that the one I ordered was no longer available so he replaced with the more expensive one but he would charge me only $18/glass,  Oh, what a favor he is doing me!!!  For the price one pays, the quality of food and service is really unacceptable.",Bad,,Bad
Food very nice but you pay for it as very expensive. Worth a treat for 1 night but couldn't afford to eat here every night!,Good,,
"A friend in our Vegas group made reservations for all of us at Jean Georges. It wasn't bad. The ambience is good and so was our service. But it was easily $100 a head, and I just didn't think it was worth it. 


Prime at Bellagio is the same chef, a little less expensive, has a better view being right next to the fountains, and the food is every inch as good or better.",,Good,Good
"Took clients there for a business dinner and it was wonderful.   Had steaks, apps, and wine.  Service was wonderful, and this place did not disappoint.",,Good,Good
"We have gone to Jean Georges a few times in our travels to Las Vegas.  This time was par for the course and the steak was magnificent.  We did feel like our server did not listen to little or big thing things we asked for during our time there.  A small thing, I asked for water with lemon with no ice, and she has the water bringer bring me a glass with very little water and a ton of ice.  I had to ask again for lemon.  It got progressively worse throughout the meal.  


We don't dress fancy.  We go to Vegas to get away from reality for a day or two, so no formal attire and we are relaxed.  I think she prejudged us and gave little care thinking she would not get a big tip.  Sorry honey, we gave our server in early March a $300 gratuity.  You missed out.


I don't think we will return for now.  There are a lot of options in glitter gulch.",,Bad,Bad
"This is one of the myriad of restaurants located at Aria Hotel & Casino.


The menu differs from most Jean Georges restaurants (highlighted by the reference to Steakhouse) but the food is of comparable quality.


I ordered a steak; it was cooked perfectly.


The service was faultless and the atmosphere was different (in a good way); the tone was dark and the lighting low.


I'd go back.",Good,Good,Good
"We booked two days in advance with the concierge of the ARIA hotel were we were staying. The restaurant wasn't fully booked and this is why I don't understand why we had to sit as a quiet couple next to a table of 6 loud guests obviously getting ready for a night drinking and gambling. The place is a little too dark to my taste but it has a nice lounge atmosphere to it. I eat glutenfree and I was pleased to see they knew what I was talking about. Our steaks were properly cooked, they have a very nice wine list and the staff was professional. But still, it wasn't what you would except from a chef like Jean Georges, no ""ouah"" feeling here. Except when you get the bill ;-)",Good,,Good
"I am a big fan of jean george, but this place has issues.  The room is nice, the service was just average, but the steaks were no good.  There were three of us and one of our steaks was full of gristle, one of the others was completely overcooked.  By the time they were redone, we were full from the starters and the sides.  Bought us a free dessert for the hassle.  We won't be back.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Had a business meeting last night..everyone was generally pleased...food was properly cooked..steaks were tasty. Service was excellent..professional & courteous. Prices were high....for pricing, same quality for about 10% less if that matters.",Good,Good,Good
"You might think you have to order red meat (all at our table loved theirs), but if you are less hungry or prefer seafood, this restaurant does a very nice job with seafood as well. Share some appetizers - but don't overdo it or you won't have room for the great main courses!  They also have a terrific wine list. Good for private parties as well.",Good,Good,
"Had a great dinner there this March with a party of twelve. After being seated immediately appetizers were terrific and wine suggestions were spot on. 


I had done my homework on TripAdvisor and had a picture of the exact steak I wanted. The waiter had no problem following through with a charred bone in ribeye with scallops which was awesome. 


Did mention to the front desk twice that the washroom needed attention to paper towels scattered on the floor which never got fixed, and noticed the atmosphere in our private dining room was non existent even though we asked to have the door propped open to get some music in it was a bit of a lost cause. 


Food itself was awesome and we'll be back but maybe with a smaller group in the main restaurant.",Good,Bad,
"Had a fantastic steak dinner with a couple other fellow 'soccer dads' as we stayed at the Aria for a Las Vegas soccer tournament for our daughter's team.


I would definitely recommend this place if you want a nice steak dinner.  Of note - it is expensive - so make certain this is understood before you sit down at the table!  Nice splurge or special occasion meal.",Good,Good,
"We arrived with our group of 10 people promptly at our 8:15 reservation time. We were seated quickly and our waitress was immediately available at the table. That is where the positive comments end. After that, it was another 10 minutes before she returned to take our drink orders - which then showed up 20 MINUTES LATER. A few minutes before that (at least 15 minutes since she took the drink orders) she showed up to take our meal order. The appetizers came out in 10-15 minutes. After that, it was almost 30 MINUTES before our entrees were brought to the table. Most were luke warm and SIGNIFICANTLY under done. I ordered my steak medium - the center was red and cool - NOT MEDIUM. Several of the people at my table had to send their steaks back to be re-fired because they were not edible. This is completely unacceptable for a restaurant of supposed excellence and cost ($65 for a steak alone - no sides). After our food was dropped off at the table, it was another 20 minutes before the waitress returned. Our displeasure was voiced and she was informed that we were ready to get the check and leave (at this point it had already been two hours since arriving). It was another 20 minutes before she even came back to the table and that was AFTER one of our party had to go speak to the manager. They did remove one round of drinks from the check and gave one of our group his meal for free (it was his birthday), but they still proceeded to tack on $150 gratuity. I understand this is a usual practice when serving a group of larger than six, however, the service was so unbelievably bad, it was the final straw. They did finally remove it from the check after another 15 MINUTE discussion with the manager but it was ridiculous. All in all we were there for almost three hours. We will NOT be returning to this restaurant for its subpar fare or its HORRIFIC service (or lack thereof).",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I never complain but service was horrible, forgot items we ordered, drinks were 20 minutes, steaks were less than warm.  If management gets this asap, I am here to discuss for the next 20 minutes.  I am sure it will take that long to get our check.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Attended a sponsored dinner.  Approximately 80 folks.  It started out a little shaky, but once the menus and the wine started coming, it was really awesome.  Appetizer of fresh seafood on ice featured beautiful oysters, very large shrimp, crab legs, etc.  Caesar salad very fresh and very easy to eat.  Meaning, sometimes salad can be awkward to eat, because you don't want green things hanging out of your mouth having been unable to insert the entire bunch on the fork into your mouth.  Not here.  The filet was absolutely melt in your mouth tender and very tasty, rare is my style.",Good,,
"Came back last night just to see if last month's 5 Star experience was a fluke.  Not a chance.  This place just keeps getting better!


I was welcomed ""back"" by the lovely hostesses and taken immediately to a great table.  The manager here is The Best!  He immediately greeted me and thanked me for my return visit.  Thanked ME?  I was the lucky one in this deal.


Service was once again over the top.  The server and the assistant servers were perfectly engaging and efficient.


The food was fresh, prepared perfectly, and plated like a fine work of art.


This time I saved room for dessert.  My only regret is not having done so last time.  It was the perfect ending to an outstanding dining experience.


Well, almost the ending.  I had an early reservation in order to make it to a show so the restaurant was not yet packed out.  The Chef took a moment to come out to introduce himself.  What a fine young man.  Talented, gracious, and humble.  Rare combination in Chefs these days.


This is an outstanding restaurant.  Jean Georges should be SO proud of this entire management team.  They are representing his fine name well.",Good,Good,Good
"We stayed at the Aria for the first time, which is a fantastic hotel. On Sunday, we went to the restaurant and personally made reservations for dinner on Wednesday, at 9:00 p.m.  We arrived at 8:50 p.m. on Wednesday and we did not have a reservation.  They did accommodate us with a table after a short wait.  Unfortunately, that's when we got lost in the shuffle.  The service was horrible.  It was at least 20 minutes to get a glass of wine.  I will say the Calamari appetizer was fantastic.  However, the wait for our steaks was so long, I really was no longer hungry.  There are so many great restaurants in Las Vegas...this is one I will not return to.",Good,Bad,Bad
All the glorious meat and potatoes in this convivial setting aside - it's worth the price of admission for the people watching. Our table to the right had the biggest pop star of the 1990s and the table to the left had a couple celebrating their divorce. Yep. Only in Vegas.,Good,Good,
"Jean George shows great care in making his menu unique to each restaurant, and Jean Georges Steakhouse is no exception. The steaks are amazing, but expect to pay a premium for the Jean Georges name.",Good,,
"This place is well located at the Aria Hotel.. It is nice, a little dark for my taste, but the whole hotel is darker than I would like... They have a great bar area with a nice view... We were taken to our table where our server Brad took very good care of us.. 
As for food, I had my signature bone in ribeye and Brad did ask the chef to cook it the right way... I was surprised that it was charred on one side only... Chef, next time you owe me both sides, maybe he was worried on not getting it ""rare"", anyways, the steak was great, very good flavor and the right amount of fat for the ribeye...
We also had the bone marrow...  ""Flinstone"" type of bone in your table... For my taste, chef, you should send it with some thick salt on top, it will give it this extra kick... The toast you sent is maybe too thick for such a delicate taste, maybe go to the drawing board on that one... 
Brussel sprouts were nice and crisp... My partner had the petite fillet with the foi gras on top... He was very much pleased by flavor and tase, so again, high five there... 
We also had a couple of bottles of Darioush, I would hope this place would keep wine at the correct temp... They were both over the serving standard.... Glasses were fine...
The place was clean.
I have to say that I was a little reluctant at the time for the reviews I read, but at the end, I was impressed..
Enjoy",Good,Good,Good
"Fun place for dinner with friends just a convention meeting and we all had a good time,wine and cocktails were great and over all i would come back",Good,Good,
"I think the best place and the best meat dinner available in the strip. You must be comfortable with very very high bill, but if u are is the top. The service is excellent and the wine list gorgeous.",Good,,Good
"My first experience at one of Jean Georges' restaurants was at his eponymous restaurant in the Trump Tower in NYC.  It was mind blowing.  That experience was furthered by having one of my friends - who had worked in his pastry kitchen - guide us through his tasting menu.
Let's just say I had high expectations for his steakhouse at Aria in Vegas and they were met.
It is important to remember that this is NOT Texas Roadhouse, Outback or even Morton's - it is a french-style Steakhouse.
The restaurant is beautifully designed and tables are well placed to make the dining room feel more intimate.
For starters we had the most delicately cooked and sweet tasting calamari that I've ever eaten.  Our Autumn Fruits and Caesar salads were tasty and perfectly dressed.
We each ordered a different steak.  All were cooked perfectly.  As a sign of how wonderful each of us thought our meals were - we never even offered to give a taste to one another.  My Australian wagyu filet was super tender and accented by a rosemary-based chimichurri sauce.  We also had the choice of 3 other sauces from varying cultures to accompany our steaks.
For sides, the creamed spinach (excellent), brussel sprouts (we returned these to the kitchen to get more caramelized and hotter ones) and the creamy mashed potatoes (very good) were enough to share for three people - but probably not for four.
The sommelier is very pleasant and knowledgeable.  His recommended 2012 Cabernet from Cade in Napa was very good.  Not quite as bold as I typically prefer for steak, but it was delicious.
Thanks also to the staff for making the entire party - including our 7 month old - feel most welcome.",Good,Good,Good
"Jean George does it right! My wagyu filet was the most tender filet I've ever had. Plus I get to brag that I have now officially had wagyu beef yay! They have several sauces that come with it, my favorite being the bearnaise. The shrimp cocktail was yummy too, but that wagyu though.",Good,,
"Maybe we were there on an off night. We had heard good things about this place and were excited to dine there. But the steaks were too fatty and the seasoning was subpar. 


The service was excellent and the atmosphere was nice. We enjoyed ourselves but did not think that the meal was worth the money. We will go back to Delmonico's or Cut for our next steak dinner.",Bad,Good,Good
"The last time I saw a restaurant appeared without available reservations and when you arrive you see half the place empty, the restaurant went bankrupt.


I went two times in 3 day to eat at this restaurant since I was staying at Aria and wanted to give it a second chance. Both times the food was a disappointment.


First time had beef short ribs. This is an uncommon plate, but it's my favorite, whenever I see it on the menu,I order it. The meat had no flavor, really small in size. It did have Allot of sauces, but really no flavor. It sent me directly to the bathroom. Next day my stomach was making a complete song.


Two days later I wanted to eat a good stake, so I went back and ordered a in bone rib eye, my favorite stake, medium done  for $69. I would just say go to Ruth Chris, it's 3 times better.
It felt I was eating A half thin size of US choice meat, really sticky.


To make matters worse, I asked the waiter if they have truffles fries, he said yes. What I received was a basket with SOGGY fries you would get on a lousy diner. With real truffles sprinkled on top.


They charged me $14 for the SOGGY fries + $8 for the additional truffles. $22 for fries!


That's not what I ordered. I didn't order additional truffles, I ordered truffled fries, they serve them everywhere, they are done with truffle oil.


Look, this place is for snobby people going in for the social life, forget about the food.
Jean George should be ashamed to put his name in this restaurant. I have eaten on his SLS restaurant in L.A. and know what amazing things he can do. This is a ripoff, stay away.",Bad,,
"A total 5 Star in every category.  I am a server's nightmare--single diner and non-drinker.  Tonight that did not seem to matter to this staff.  They treated me as a VIP.  Well, that's the service.


The food was also 5 Star.  They started with a nice variety of fresh breads.  My salad was crisp and fresh with strips of real bacon (no bacon bits here).  My entree was the 8 oz filet (cooked a Perfect Pittsburg rare) and bone marrow that should not be missed.  My side was the best sweet potato I have ever eaten.  Can't tell you about the desserts as I was way too full from the generous portions of food.


I have already made my reservation to return next month.",Good,Good,Good
"Dined at Aria's steakhouse and was absolutely fantastic.  Located in the Aria.  Drinks were great.  Service was topnotch and attentive. Steaks were out of this world.  Bone-in ribeye was perfect.  Checkout the Tomahawk steak if you dare.  It was so awesome, we even did the super touristy group photo!",Good,Good,Good
"We booked a table for 2 for 7:30pm as we were attending Zarkana at Aria at 9:30pm. We got there sharp on time and were asked to sit at small lounge area near the entrance and wait for someone to seat us. We waited 18mn and after calling the hostess more then 4 times (she would pass in front if us and not answer us), she stopped to explain rudely that they were running late and could not have a table ready before 8pm. We explained that our booking was for 7:30pm and she just said ""I can't do anything for you"". We were offered to speak to the manager who repeated the same thing and were finally seated finally at 7:55pm. 
Surprisingly, the restaurant was not full and we could see many empty tables while waiting (20% of the tables were empty and remained empty). So we are not sure why we had to wait 25mn to be seated.
Then, the waiters were all very nice, but rushing us as they new we had our show at 9:30pm.
The experience could have been more pleasurable had we been seated on time and not been over rushed. The food was good and overall matched our expectations.
A clear illustration of how bad welcoming and rude persons (the hostess) can ruin a nice place's reputation.",Good,Bad,
"Stopped in early and sat at the bar.  Excellent bartender service and conversation.  Yes, their cheeseburger is expensive as far as cheeseburgers go, but theirs is far beyond the ordinary.  The burger is obviously a mixture of prime beef cuts and perfectly cooked.  It will make a juicy mess but that is a good thing.  The accompanying cheese, pickles, and baby leaf lettuce go perfectly.  Was less impressed with the side of truffle fries.",Good,,Good
"Our group stayed next door at the Monte Carlo as part of a large golf tournament outing, so we decided to walk next door to the Aria and experience some fine dining at the Jean Georges.


Our party of 8 arrived early and was seated promptly. The group had various appetizers, ranging from sweet BBQ baby back ribs, to succulent bacon wrapped shrimp to tasty crab cakes. No complaints there.


I opted for the Wagyu filet that was grilled perfectly. Others in the party raved about the bone-in rib eye. No one dared to try the $330 certified Kobe filet from japan. The broiled bone marrow was also a hit. Grilled asparagus and roasted mushrooms complimented the entrees nicely, but we were disappointed with the fries and lobster mash potatoes. 


Service was attentive without being intrusive.",Good,,Good
"The tasting menu was memorable especially for a steakhouse. It was unique and not very steakhousy which is a good thing. 
The dining room has a cool vibe with a sorta sleek, dark, sexy feel. It felt very vegas to me.",Good,Good,
"An upscale steakhouse that forgets about the customer. We had a special night here and orders some good steak. The steak quality was good but they cook did a poor job and I could taste the gas in the crust of the meat. It was edible but definitely not top quality from a cooking perspective. The wait staff seem uninterested in checking or providing decent service. The only one who did a good job was the waither who was filling the water glass. Unfortunately, for an upscale steakhouse...disappointment.",Bad,Bad,Bad
The food and appetizers were good. I don't even recall what I had. The service was strong.  The deserts especially the chocolate lava cake was exceptional,Good,,Good
"Service started out great, then after the restaurant got busier, my waiters were far less attentive and even negligent.  My first course, butternut squash soup was very good.  Decent selection of wines by the glass.  Nice non steak selections.


My entr√©e, the shortribs were delicious, but should have been trimmed in the kitchen.  They were quite fatty and did not seem to be of prime quality.  After receiving them, I could not find my waiter, or any other to send them back.  My baked sweet potato was barely warm, also had a hard time sending it back.  Because my ribs were hot, I picked through them and started eating.  I had a show to get to.  It was a good 10-12 minutes until one of the servers finally came back to ask about my meal.  I was nearly done with my entr√©e, but was able to send the potato back.  The second time it came back hot.


The location was convenient since I was staying at the hotel.  The staff was nice, but were not trained very well in captain style service.  The staff needs more training, but I have come to find that good help is hard to get in LV.  There are just so many places that need staff, and a restaurant does not seem to invest in the employees since so few employees remain for very long.",Bad,Good,Bad
"We had reservations at another restaurant in a different hotel, but after coming out of a late show, we were starving! The hostess got us in right away without having reservations, so that was awesome! I ordered the wagyu carpaccio as an appetizer and it was HEAVENLY! I could have eaten five orders of that as my dinner! I ordered the scallop dish as an entree, I was also very happy with that. My mom ordered steak and fries for dinner, her steak was delicious, but I think she was expecting something special from the fries and didn't get it. However the scotch bonnet steak sauce made a great dipping sauce for her! My sister also got a steak, and ordered the asparagus. I'm sad to say her steak was overdone and the asparagus was burned, not caramelized or lightly charred, it was burned and gross. It was a bit overpriced for what we got, but the food was good for the most part, though we probably should have just gone to Bouchon.",Good,,
"Date of visit 1/15/16:
Party of 10 celebrating what was supposed to be a great time and top notch meal.
 
The restaurant itself is gorgeously appointed and comfortable. Our group reserved a private glass-enclosed room for our privacy, expecting a pricey meal with over-the-top quality and outstanding service.
 
To give you an idea of the price range, you can expect to spend about $300 per couple for appetizer, main entre and 2 sides, not including drinks or tip.  Our group of 10 spent about $1800 all in.
 
Unfortunately, Jean George's fell much short of expectations.
 
The Food
-Sides and appetizers were delicious, really pretty great.  We had one of almost every side offered‚Ä¶..saut√©ed mushrooms, brussel sprouts, asparagus, mac n cheese, baked potatoes, sweet potatoes.
-Steaks were OK.  Two of the 8 in our party who ordered steaks sent them back because they were not cooked to order.  No one was really impressed.  Several of us had the New York strip, a tomahawk ribeye, and a few filet mignons.
-Seafood was delicious.  We had a few seafood appetizers and a blackened sea bass.
 
The Service
Service was inexcusably poor and to our dismay continued to disappoint throughout the night. 
 
Our host introduced himself and the specials and said he would be taking care of us, as you would expect. He then disappeared for most of the rest of the night.  Other waiters were in and out to take orders and serve the meal.  The new staff never introduced themselves and were sloppily dressed.  Guy in a wrinkled shirt looked tired like he might have been in the kitchen and a rude Hispanic lady.  A few others as well with no introduction.
 
Throughout the meal, the ferris wheel of wait staff came across as indifferent and disinterested to the point of being unprofessional.  ""Push me your glass, I can't reach"", was uttered to me by a Hispanic lady in broken English more than once.  Are you kidding me?  What is she doing interacting with customers like this?  There is no excuse for poor service and you are in fact right to expect only the most top notch service.  By that, I mean knowledgeable, courteous and dedicated staff, prompt service, maybe even a wet napkin.  No disruptions.  Our staff did not make us feel special at all.  I literally have had better service at Sizzler.
 
After an hour and feeling abandoned, we finally had to ask for them to take our order.  When the food arrived 45min later, the servers did not check in to see how things were cooked after service.  We had to get their attention after 20 minutes when they were filling drinks. 
 
While we waiting for our food, a bouncy photographer lady entered the room and said she was there to take our pictures and had us pose for several shots.  It was unsolicited and little disruptive, but we didn't want to be rude and refuse, so we obliged.  There was no mention of cost or anything.  After the meal, she marched in with portfolios full of printed pictures of each couple and the entire group.  ""They're $140 a piece, but if you really like them you can have them for $100.""  We all looked at each other like ""I wasn't expecting this""? Her approach was such a put-off that we just bit our lips and pretended to look thru the portfolios for a bit.
 
In the end, we decided not to get any because they were not memorable and so we politely told her no thanks.  That's when she started getting really pushy and red in the face.  She said, ""you guys did all this work and you're not going to buy anything!?""  What she meant was SHE did all that work and wanted us to buy something even if we didn't like it.  We again told her that we didn't want any and then she really went off.  ""You guys can't each pitch in a few dollars and at least get the group photo?""  Not when she was acting like that, we all thought, we just wanted her to go.  She finally grabbed her stuff in a huff and stormed out.  We all looks at each other in disbelief. Unbelievable.
 
Here's a tip, Jean George.  It's time for a reality check on your service.
1. Staff seemed to be completely untrained for this caliber of restaurant.  Always provide continuity of wait staff to each party.
2. Quality check the food before it's served.
3. Make the customer feel special.
4. Regularly check in to see how the customers are doing.  How is the food?  Can I get you anything?
5. Get rid of this photographer.  She is tacky, misleading, aggressive and doesn't belong in a place like this.  Her behavior downgraded the whole experience and is totally inexcusable for any restaurant.
 
Looking back, my experience was so overwhelmingly negative that I couldn't help but write a review.  I also intend to call the manager to express my dissatisfaction.  I‚Äôm sure that a steakhouse of this caliber will be interested this feedback and do aim to provide the most excellent food and service.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We hosted a company dinner at Jean Georges and we were very pleased with everything!  The food was amazing (albeit a little expensive), the service was top notch, and the communication prior to our dinner was efficient.  Everyone raved about their food, we had several different steaks, fish, shrimp, and everything was great!",Good,Good,Good
"Great atmosphere and service.  I had the bone in ribeye.  Cooked perfectly.


Table next to us had bone marrow.  It looked like something from cave man days.  It was monstrous and looked yummy.  Got to try next time.",Good,Good,Good
"While staying in the Aria, we chose one of our dining experiences to be at Jean Georges located onsite. We were very excited and had high expectations due to great reviews and the fact that the prices were $$$$! (clearly higher costs don't always equate to a better experience)
The restaurant itself was extremely well done and cozy. A beautiful location and a warm inviting presentation!
The staff were very professional and friendly. (they are what made the experience and rating just poor instead of terrible)
The wine selection was extraordinary and the sommelier was helpful and polite. (again, great service keeping this review out of the basement)
The food, of which we had high expectations, was not what we had hoped.
To be fair, the lobster bisque soup was good, but served slightly cooler than I would have imagined.
The side was cold when brought to the table. (quickly remedied by the wait staff with apologies)
My wife's USDA 8oz filet was strangely dry, oddly colored (although cooked properly at med rare) and had a peculiar flavor to it. This was the teeter point of feeling like a whiny customer for me. I'm starting to look for the exit instead of summoning the manager. Dinner should be a low conflict affair! We said nothing about her steak and left it 85% untouched on the plate.
My steak (18oz bone in rib-eye) was ok, but just ok. It seemed reminiscent of something from Outback or the like. I know it wasn't the A5 Kobe, but it was a steak in a high end reputable restaurant. There's an expectation level already built it in. I attempted to share some of it with my wife, but she was not feeling like red meat of any kind after her taste test of the filet.
We skipped desert and after dinner drinks and left feeling disappointed. My wife actually didn't feel well the rest of the evening.
I hate to write a poor review of any kind and I'm sure the good and hardworking folks at Jean Georges strive to create a superb dining experience...it just didn't work this time.",Bad,Good,Good
Took my family here after Christmas.  Service was awesome.  The food crazy good.  The waiters were knowledgable and fun.,Good,,Good
"Very friendly staff here --  form the hostess to the waiter to the Sommelier to the support staff, every one of them treated us as if we really mattered.  The manager on duty also came by once to check on us.  It was not crowded, nor was it empty.  The noise level was minimal as the restaurant is not right out in the casino area (it is upstairs and a little off the beaten path).  


The food was top-notch.  I was a little surprised (and disappointed) the butternut squash soup used chicken stock, but other than that, a fine dining experience.  Steak was cooked as ordered, the sauces were fun to try, the asparagus was perfectly grilled.  Wine selection is quite extensive (and expensive - there were bottle from $100 to $14,000).


Would certainly come back!",Good,Good,Good
"Along with its sister restaurant, Prime at Bellagio, Jean Georges is our go to for ribeye steak. Jean Georges is less elegant than Prime a and menu less extensive, but the food is everything is good and especially the ribeye you cannot go wrong with ribeye. The wine list is extensive and excellent complement to the meal. And decide to wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.",Good,,Good
"With so many options in Las Vegas especially at such a high price point it's a shame for this place to run like this. Scatterbrained waitress was just the beginning. It was a Thursday night and for the most part an empty house, but you wouldn't know it. You would have thought there were 300 tables and one waitress because the service was that bad. I feel so guilty giving a low rating because the food was good. Beyond the poor table service, the kitchen seemed off that night. Would have been nice to have my mother's 60th birthday dinner together. A few of us were served our dinner then 20 minutes later the rest of were. Desserts were the same. Just an awful experience. Beautiful space but definitely not up to par. Skip this one.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We chose to begin with a Wagyu Carpaccio, followed by Seared Diver Scallops. Both were amazing and delicious. The ambiance is elegant and the waiters are very attentive and friendly.",Good,Good,Good
"My husband and I wanted to have a nice dinner while enjoying our stay at the Aria. I had the butternut squash soup to start with, the soup and the service were both amazing! We both ordered the short rib, which I would highly recommend. I ordered a side of Brussels sprouts and my husband ordered a side of  truffle mac n' cheese. Two people can easily split a side, good to know for future visits. It was a little pricey for a normal dinner date with my husband but if you are going to splurge in Vegas this is the place to do it! I still think about that short rib!!",Good,,
"Had dinner here with my husband and 2 adult kids recently and can't say enough great things about this restaurant! The service was fantastic and the food incredible, from appetizers to deserts!  
If you are looking for a nice sit down, take your time and enjoy great food then this is the place! Yes it is a little more pricy but in my opinion, well worth it!
We will be back on our next trip to Vegas!",Good,Good,Good
"Food was fabulous, and priced accordingly.  We both had steaks, and they were very good. Nice selection of side dishes.  Would go back!",Good,Good,
"The steak and sea food was very good.
The server was very friendly and pleasant.
She can back many times to check up on us.",Good,,Good
"Mixed bag for the whole table. Some loved the meal.  Service is just fair.  Tried to be showy but never came back to see if dinner was even served properly. 


Deserts not great.   $82 steak was not cooked correctly or edible.   They did take it back once the busboy came to clear the table. 


Drink was delivered wrong and the bartender could care less.   Said oh well.  Next time. 


Not worth the trip.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Everything here spells glamour. The food is very good and same thing for the service. The ambience is second to none. It is expensive though.,Good,Good,Good
"We were a party of 6 for my moms 60th birthday. The food was just ok for the price. Nothing spectacular. Our server was annoying. She wouldn't stop talking. The photographer lady was extremely pushy. After we told her no several times she just started taking pictures of us ""because she was bored""",Good,Bad,Bad
"My short rib was very good, but my spouses Filet Mignon lacked flavor. While tender, we can get better in our home town and for much less. Granted, we did not get the $300.00 steak. We could not eat that much.


They did have nice sauces, fresh and distinct. And, there was a granny smith apple puree under my short rib that was excellent. It was beautiful, did not turn color with oxidation and was not overly citrus flavored. Nice!


The service was very, very slow and spotty. We seemed to have about 3 servers who did not communicate with each other, apparently.  Luckily we are a self-entertaining couple or we might have just left.",Good,,Bad
"DO NOT pass this restaurant! Tip- they serve early dinner (order before 7:00 pm) for a fixed price of 69$ includes a salad, entr√©e and desert. Don't pass on the steak it made to perfection. Service very professional and decor dark and fancy.",Good,Good,Good
"My wife and I went to Jean Georges twice during our stay in Las Vegas.  Had the rib eye and crab legs both times.  The first night we had mashed potatoes as our side, the second we had creamed spinach.  No problem getting a table again made reservation earlier in the week. Service was better the first night because the team of servers were more attentive.  The steaks were one of the best we have had.  This is a go to place.  Will be back",Good,,Good
Steak was not cooked to perfection.  Pricey for what it is.  Service was not good. Expresso was cold.  The only good was the bread.  Excellent srlection.,Bad,,Bad
"We were in the mood for a steak, and happened to be in Aria.  We sat at the bar and had drinks and steaks.  Good, juicy steaks, well prepared, ample drinks and great service.  It's not our favorite steak house, but was a good, fairly priced meal.",Good,,Good
"Go there. Eat there. Spend your money. You'll make more. Just yes. 
In all seriousness, Aria has the best restaurants in Vegas with the top 3 being Bardot, Julian Serrano and Jean Georges. Don't bother going elsewhere.",Good,Good,
"Attended a fairly large group dinner and everything was superb.  The shrimp cocktail was delish....shrimp were huge, meaty and the sauce was just right.  My filet was cooked to perfection and could easily be described as one of the best I've ever had.  The chef came out to greet our group and no details were overlooked. Wonderful evening!",Good,Good,
"I have to say this is one of the better steakhouses on the strip, dark, well appointed. Professional serving staff, the real issue was they serve in teams and was constantly walking by and pouring wine, I had to ask them to slow down twice. I really did not like that.


Food fantastic well prepared top quality. But I do have to say I thought their pricing was a bit higher than I would have expected.


If your a steak fan and can afford it the Wagyu is an option. I had the veal which I thought was some of the best veal outside of Paris I have had.",Good,Good,Bad
"Excellent service outstanding steaks
Definitely will go back. Side dishes exceptional -expensive but everything was superb . Only drawback is poor quality coffee but that appears to be a problem all over",Good,,Good
"My wife and I dined here recently. We were greeted promptly and warmly, and seated (after some negotiation) at an excellent table, seated side-by-side, overlooking the room. Room is beautifully furnished and lit, not too bright or dark.  Noise level is moderate. Service was prompt, friendly and professional.  Food was excellent; although we tend to stick to the basics in steakhouses, the tuna tartare was superb,  oysters served correctly, excellent salmon and steak (cooked perfectly medium-rare), good creamed spinach. Four complimentary steak sauces were fun to try, although to me  the classic B√©arnaise won out over the more trendy ones. The lettuce salad w/ bacon and blue cheese had an unusual rather spicy dressing, which I thought was ok, but perhaps a bit overpowering. Dessert was Apple Pie w/ ice cream, not delicate, but delicious. Wine list was extensive and expensive, but had some reasonable values if you looked carefully. Overall, a really nice dinner.",Good,,Good
"We went to this steakhouse to try the $150 pp tasting menu.  We would definitely go back.  The atmosphere is nice, although the dance music was unnecessary.  The service was very good.  The food was awesome.  All aspects of the tasting menu were terrific, except for the scallop dish which was solidly good.  The caviar starter was just divine.  The autumn fruit salad was heavenly.  The tuna tartare and Wagyu filet were exceptional. The desserts of chocolate lava cake and the peanut butter and concord grape sundae were outstanding. Overall, a terrific dining experience.",Good,Good,Good
My wife and I had a reservation for 630. We were promptly seated and provided menus. The wait staff was friendly and prompt. We had to ask for the early dining menu. We selected the early dining menu items and ordered. The Caesar salad was one of the best I have ever had. The entr√©e came and it was a steak on a plate...no sides. If this would have been explained when we ordered I would have made a different selection. Deserts were great. Overall it was a great dinner. I just wish we would have been told that you are ordering a steak on a plate. I have been to many steak houses where you order sides separate....this was a prix fix menu and did not provide any direction that you were going to get a lonely piece of meat on a plate....next time...,Good,Good,Good
"My husband and I had dinner at Jean George Steakhouse the evening before Thanksgiving at 5:30 pm.  We were seated promptly with no wait.  Service was TOP NOTCH!! We were even allowed to see the kitchen after our dinner.  My husband has the 8 oz filet Mignon and I had the braised short ribs.  We split a organic sweet potato an had a side of three seared scallops.  The dinner was served with a break basket including pretzel rolls, cheddar chili crisps and french bread.  A choice of four sauces was also provided suitable for use on steak or fish.  The filet (cooked to a perfect medium) was exceptional.  Excellent texture and flavor.  The braised short ribs  - marinaded for 8 hours in a soy mixture and served with apple celery comfit on  top - were out of this world. Literally, it was one of the top three meals I've EVER had. The sweet potato was served with a nut (sunflower seed, pumpkin seed and almond) granola and maple butter.  Absolutely fantastic.  The only disappointing item was the scallops.  They were bland and slightly fishy - not sweet and creamy as I expected. I ate one bite and left the rest.  There is an on site photographer who takes photos (Sold for $70 or $140 after dinner). Music is also excellent - light jazz primarily but soft enough to allow conversation. Dinner for two - no dessert and one drink - was $178 for two and worth it, minus the scallops.",Good,Good,Good
"My husband and I took advantage of the tasting menu with wine pairing.  The caviar with lemon gelle was fantastic as was the tuna timbale.  The scallop was lovely and perfectly seared.  The only course we truly were not thrilled with was the Wagyu filet with soy glaze.  I found the steak to be tougher than expected, and WAY too salty.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend.",Good,Good,
Cava was great here. Ordered the salmon and veal which were good. Loved the Brussels sprouts and liked the crab cake. Ben our server was awesome. Hotel itself is beautiful!,Good,Good,Good
"Even with it being the ""Worst High End Steak Dinner"" in Vegas, it's not horrible. The food is okay, the service was fantastic, but we expected more for such a highly rated restaurant. Let's start with the appetizers, we had three different things at our table. The burrata salad was nothing to write home about, I wouldn't order it again. The Wagyu Carpaccio was okay and the real stand out was the butternut squash soup. We all had steak and each ordered ours medium rare, all come out medium. The server was gracious and they quickly made things right, but getting the temp on the steak should not be an issue at a restaurant of this caliber. The sides were over salted, the homemade sauces were a disappointment. Maybe we picked a bad night? With all that said, the servers were all very prompt and attentive, so you'll definitely get a high end experience. I just wish the food had been consistent with the service. Disappointed.",Bad,Good,Good
We found this steakhouse to be one of the best we tried in LV. You must try it. Very great steaks. The sides are wonderful and the staff is very friendly.,Good,,Good
"I went there with 3 guys who all ate steak.  While they all agreed the steak was good but not the best on the strip, they all concurred the Short Rib I ordered was amazing.  We had mushrooms and peppers, mac and cheese, creamed spinach as sides, and some tempura shrimp and bacon wrapped shrimp as appetizers.  Atmosphere was busy but not packed on a Wednesday night.  I would go back.  Also the caesar salad was decent.  Service on point.",Good,,Good
"The modernist setting and comfortable booth/table arrangements were appealing and open, the wine list was extraordinary, either by the glass or by the bottle, but the food was EXCEPTIONAL.  Our waitress was extremely knowledgable and we ordered a Porterhouse Steak ($109) sliced for three people to share along with freshly grilled asparagus and roasted trumpet mushrooms ($16 each).  The quantity of food was sufficient, and as our reservation was for late arrival (9:30pm) the manager was checking on us regularly to see that all was satisfactory.  His name is Pano and truly the experience couldn't be better.  We look forward to returning when we are back in Vegas during Christmas week (21-24 December).",Good,Good,Good
"I ate at Jean Georges for the first time last week while staying at the Aria.  It was an awesome two thumbs way up experience.  I used the think Prime at Bellagio was best steak in town, but I think Jean Georges is even better‚Ä¶  Very happy with the steak, the service, cocktails, wine, and dessert.  This will definitely be back on my itinerary when I back in Vegas.  Don't miss this place!!",Good,Good,Good
"The best steak, truly a great restaurant would definitely recommend this restaurant. Service great too.",Good,Good,Good
We had the filet and I ordered medium rare while my wife ordered medium. The chef nailed both of the preferred ranges with perfection. The steak melted in our mouths while the dipping sauces they provided where out of this world. The Caesars salad was balanced well and the mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious! Tip =  we ate early due to a show and made sure we had an early lunch/brunch to be sure we were hungry. They offer a early 3 course menu for 69.00 per person which we had and it was fantastic!,Good,,
"We were with a large group celebrating a very special occasion.  The next day we learned one by one, that our party was so disappointed with their meal. I have never tasted such poorly cooked steak.  The best part about the Sea Bass, was the mushroom. Service and atmosphere were wonderful but the meal was so bad that, not only would I not recommend this place, i would encourage people to find somewhere else.",Bad,Good,Good
"A good steak in Las Vegas can really blow the budget. Although the food was fine, it didn't blow me away. $55 - $65 for a steak is a lot but if it's an incredible experience or special occasion that's okay. They had a steak special for $333. I asked the waitress to repeat the price. It must have been Kobe beef but still, a steak the price of a luxury room in Las Vegas? Would never go back.",Bad,Bad,
"Went there after being told it was ""the best steak house ever""!  Well it's not.  It's good but not the best. Good bar, nice wine list.  Our table ordered, Lamb Filet, Filet Mignon, Salmon & NY Strip.  All were good.  For some reason, all meats were served with a small cup of peppery spiced mint jelly.  I love mint jelly but this spicy jelly tasted awful!",Good,,
"I wanted to like this place, but it did not wow me.  Especially for the price point.  The service was decent, but the food was not up to par with a fine dining experience.",Bad,,Good
"We had an excellent meal, everything served to perfection. Service was extremely slow. Waiter totally forgot that my wife ordered a glass of wine, even after confirming what type she wanted. It finally arrived just after we received our meal. Service left a lot to be desired.",Good,,Bad
"Good steaks, highly reviewed on websites, the price is what you would expect to pay on the strip. Good ambiance.",Good,Good,
"We came here the Friday night we got into town. Even at 9 we had a 45 minute wait. It was dark inside. No table clothes and veneer on table was chipped like at a fast food restaurant. Waiter looked tired and bothered. Food was above average, but nothing I will remember. Expensive.",Good,Bad,Bad
I had dinner with a vendor that was simply excellent.  Food quality was perfect and service exactly right.,Good,,Good
"Love everything about this place, the food, the scenery, the staff top notch. Excellent choices and recommendations, fabulous wine.",Good,Good,Good
"Our party of five enjoyed our experience at Jean Georges very much.  The restaurant is nicely decorated with deep tones and shadows. The booths and tables were comfortable and overall the noise level was acceptable.  The 6 oz Kobe filet was tender and flavorful and just the right size, and we enjoyed the sampling of sauces that was brought for the table.  We ordered several sides, and most notable was the truffle mac and cheese - delicious!  Other items we sampled included the tuna tartar which was light and flavorful, the blue cheese salad that included some delightfully sweet cherry tomatoes and a tangy dressing that had a bit of a peppery kick, the short rib which was tender and had a deep, rich flavor.  The trumpet mushrooms were spicy but good.  The only thing I didn't care for is that there are no free refills on soft drinks.  In my mind, if you pay $4.50 for a diet coke, it should be bottomless, but unfortunately, it was not.  Overall, it was a good meal; on my scale of memorable meals, it ranks about a 7.",Good,Good,
"Even if you are dressed casually you can feel comfortable in this restaurant. There were seven of us and most of ordered from the $69 pre-fixe menu and were not disappointed. The service is very attentive and everyone enjoyed the atmosphere and good. The salad was delicious, the steak was tender as one would expect and the dessert was very good. Would go back.",Good,Good,Good
"The restaurant is huge on the inside. Was quite full even at the early hour of 7 pm. The staff was attentive but not overly so. The steak was excellent and delicious. The side of mushrooms were nice but not what I had expected. As a prior review pointed out I was surprised to see cheap table tops in a top flight restaurant such as this. 


Overall the steak was excellent and didn't disappoint. So if you are staying nearby and want to avoid going far this is an excellent steakhouse.",Good,Good,Good
"The food is pretty good in the Jean Georges steakhouse but a few details took away from the experience of eating there. First, the awful background music, Second, the low lighting makes it impossible to determine details at times. Third, any restaurant that aspires to deliver a quality dining experience can surely use nice tablecloths instead of presenting food on what seem to be old and scratched tables. These details aside, the service and food are what you'd expect from a high-end U.S. steakhouse: well executed and pretty expensive (especially the sides). The wine list is long and extensive. Some value is to be had, but you're still going to pay quite a bit for whatever you drink.",Good,Bad,Good
"Delicious food from start to finish. JG is definitely on the pricier side, but if you're in the mood for steak and in the mood to splurge, try it and you won't be disappointed. Both steak and seafood were amazing, as were all the sides. Definitely try the truffle mac and cheese!
Oh, and the women's bathrooms are a must see!",Good,Good,
"This is a really nice restaurant.  We had great service and our waiter was very attentive and made sure that we had everything we needed including refills and that we were having a good time.  The only thing I did not like is was that I ordered an 18oz Ribeye steak, and ordered it Medium.  The steak came out closer to Medium well than medium, but it still was ok so I did not say anything about it.  But overall rating would be very good.",Good,Good,Good
The service was great from the start. The ambiance of the restaurant was very classy and very comfortable. The food was amazing - our party tried different dishes and were pleased!  Especially with the truffle mac & cheese!!,Good,Good,Good
I been wanting to try Jean George Steakhouse for a while and kept passing it up big mistake. My wife and I had dinner here Sunday night and it was amazing. The service was great and the Steak was amazing Most likely the best steak I have ever had. I got the bone in tomahawk rib-eye it was cook perfect and the quality was amazing. The service was great and the sommelier was very knowledgeable and help of pick out a good bottle of wine. also had the Truffle Mac and cheese and Lobster Mash potatoes both excellent. Price was very good also our meal with bottle of wine was about $380 before tip. but that included a $120 steak special and $100 bottle of wine. Will return again,Good,Good,Good
"Very pleasant meal with colleagues, I had the New York, can be pricey but the quality of the food is excellent",Good,Good,
"I ordered the filet mignon, medium. It was cooked perfectly and the fries are delicious.
The cocktails are nice a bit strong for me though. 
I would eat here again and recommend it to everyone.",Good,Good,
Well from the moment you walk in you feel like an elite group of people. Service is at a premium is this Steakhouse. The food is displayed so beautiful you want to take a picture. The lighting is a very romantic touch or just a quite way to enjoy a group dinner.,Good,Good,Good
"What was supposed to be one of our highlights of our trip to Vegas turned out to be a very expensive damp squib--60 th birthday celebration spoilt by overrated food , waitron with an attitude , steaks ordered medium rare served charred and to cap it off the cleaning staff leaning over me trying to clean the table while I was still battling to finish my meal. If only the waiter when he bothered to ask how the meal was had stopped for longer than 2 seconds. None of us at table will ever return to this restaurant!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We dined at Jean George prior to the Cirque show that night. Very intimate and classy setting. Excellent service from beginning to end from our two waiters and one busser. We both had the signiture tasting menu for $125/pp which was 5 or 6 courses of the most amazing food, including the most tender and incredible wagyu beef steak ever. Highly recommended.",Good,Good,Good
"I had dinner with my wife, niece and nieces coworker at Jean Georges Steakhouse last week and it was outstanding. It is pricey as I am sure other reviews will attest, but it is worth it. The atmosphere and food are fabulous, and the service is impeccable. Highly recommend the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp, Caesar Salad, Wagyu Beef and Scallops. The wine list can break most budgets for a bottle, and only my wife and I were having wine. We settled on a Cabernet at $19 per glass. It was by far the best Cabernet I have ever had. I usually do not pay more than $12 and mostly drink Josh, Chateau St Jean and others in that price range. This $19 glass of Cabernet made my usual seem very ordinary. You do not need to select the $100 plus plus bottles for an enjoyable complement to the outstanding food. Everything was very flavorful. You can have an ordinary dinner anywhere. Jean Georges is well worth it for treating yourself and guests.",Good,Good,Good
"Fantastic service and more than accommodating when we arrived with my two-year-old toddler on a Sunday night. They found a highchair from one of the hotel's other restaurants and made us feel welcome for our entire meal. Food (steaks, veal, lobster mashed potatoes, etc) was outstanding, cocktails sublime, and I will definitely be back!",Good,Good,Good
"The highlight of our trip to Vegas. This is one of the top chef's in the U.S. And it was truly a privilege to dine there. I found out before going there that Chef Jean is the one who invented the molten lava chocolate desert with vanilla ice cream. If you go, you must try it. The steaks were awesome and especially the potatoes  everything was very tasty and special. Love it. Will be back for sure.",Good,Good,
"Well, if money is no object than this is your spot. The atmosphere is comfortable and romantic. The service is pretty darn good. The steaks are excellent. If you get a side dish and wanting a real treat, go for the truffle mac and cheese - decadent. This meal will cost you, but you are paying for the dining experience. Go here for s special occasion or if you win at the casino. It is a luxury treat and probably worth every penny.",Good,Good,Good
"I had the Chilean sea bass, I would give it a 4. I think I prefer steak.   It was good.  My husband had the ribeye.  It was great.  The calamari was the best I have ever had.  The restaurant was very dark.  We all had our phone flash lights out to read the menu.  Staff was very attentive.  Would definitely go back.",Good,Bad,Good
"Best Steakhouse in Vegas by far, quality of meats is top. Service was great, even the bread was excellent.",Good,Good,Good
"2nd time here. Had the 8oz fillet mignon steak with mash.. Cooked to perfection!! My wife had salmon, and she loved it. Had a beer each and one bottle of water. Was $150 but worth it. Very classy place. And staff are amazing!'",Good,Good,Good
"This was the fourth or maybe fifth time my husband has taken a business group ranging anywhere from 12 to 20 people to Jean George's for dinner.  They never fail to deliver first class service and excellent food.  This time I even got a recipe emailed from the chef!! That is something you do not see often. 


When considering a group I encourage you to book one of the two private dining rooms. Your dinner will be more intimate and you can have. Stand up breaks and visits with the other end of the table and not intrude on other guests.
 
Best service for groups we have found on the strip and we have tried many.",Good,Good,Good
"Yes it's located on the promenade level of Aria. Yes the menu is higher priced and everything is a la carte. However, I ate here twice last week and both times were exceptional. The steaks and food were very good and the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. I would rather pay a premium price if I have confidence that everything will be amazing.",Good,Good,Good
"Here is the deal................this steak house is located at the Aria Hotel and Casino. That should tell you something right there. Aria is where people with lots of money go to eat, drink and gamble. This is a high rollers steakhouse. 


Steaks average around $60.00. Appetizers average around $24.00. To get a cheap bottle of wine will probably cost you $80.00. 


When my wife and I ate here, we did enjoy the hip atmosphere and the food. Not so much the tab which comes along with it. Expect to pay around $300+ for two people to eat here. 


Tip - there is a tasting menu for $125.00 which looked really good. 


5 star for high rollers with no budget
3 stars for the hard working, $5 a hand black jack crowd.",Good,Good,
"This is a great place to eat. We ate here before we went to see the Elvis show here  in the Aria, the restaurant is located in Aria too.  I do not think they have the show anymore in Vegas. The food here is a little pricey.",Good,Good,
"Booked a private dining room (Chef's table) with a group of colleagues to celebrate a special event. Decision was based on tripadvisor comments but also for convenience and availability in short notice.  Glad I did.
Everyone in the table admitted it was one of the best steaks/burgers/fish they had in a while, selection includes some rare cuts. 
The starters and the sides were immaculate too.  Fresh ingredients, not artificial flavor enhancers (or if they did they fooled everyone..) perfect grilled steaks, very attentive service and some of the best wines money can buy in the wine list..
Perhaps on the expensive side but there are more expensive places in the area that dont even come close to the quality and experience this place offered us.  Well done everyone from waiters and servers to management and decorators and of course the chef and his staff!",Good,Good,Good
"Excellent food.  Make this a stop on your trip.  Nice wine choice and a great summer cocktail made with gin, mint, and cucumber",Good,,
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  The Tuna Tartare appetizer is one of the best I've had anywhere.  The ribeyes and sirloins are excellent.  


During my most recent visit, my steak was absolutely fantastic but I had trimmed off much more fat than my companion who ordered the same cut.  I mentioned this to the server and we were treated to a complementary dessert and coffee.  


Even without the compensation, the meal was excellent and there was no question I would return on my next visit to Las Vegas.",Good,Good,Good
"The service was top notch. Plan on staying at this restaurant for a few hours; not because the service is slow, but because the experience is so enjoyable. The food, service and wine selection are all wonderful. We really took our time and enjoyed our evening dinning at Jean Georges. I will definitely visit Jean Georges again.",Good,Good,Good
"The best steak I have EVER eaten!  Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, with great sides of asparagus, mashed potatoes and assortment of breads.  Lovely, just lovely!",Good,,
"We made 5:00 p.m. reservations before the Zarkana Cirque Du Soleil show at the Aria.  The 3-course menu early-bird dinner with our own wine ($35 corkage, high, but we brought a fabulous wine from our own cellar. So we avoided high markups, but they have a very nice wine list, tho' low on Paso Robles wines, which are our favorites. 


 We both had the 8oz filet mignon, and I had the Burrata Mozzarella (great), hubby had the caesar salad (average).  We ordered a side of frilled asparagus, and it was perfect.  No need for a potato. Our filets were fabulous, and I took some back to the hotel room refrigerator and put it on ice for our drive back to LA. We had it for dinner after we returned home. 


Dessert was warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream - delicious.  We had a great server, Good, it's a pretty dining room and we would most likely return next time we stay at the Aria!


As the waiter suggested ""stick with the steak -- we are a steakhouse!""  Good advice!",Good,Good,Good
"The steak was very good, but the price was over the top expensive.  Plus we had to wait for an hour from the time we ordered until our food arrived.  The service was so so.  All things considered, I would much prefer a Ruth's Chris.  Same quality, better service, and more reasonable price....",,Bad,Bad
"Just as the title says, we LOVE Jean Georges! The first time we visited was for my partners 30th birthday. I called ahead to ask if they could prepare a cake for the table and it came out wonderfully! the drinks are amazing and the steak is melt in your mouth. We had the wagyu filet mignon. So. Good. I love the ambiance of the restaurant as well has a good vibe, but not too loud and cluby. Top of the line service, but a little spendy definitely worth it though!",Good,Good,Good
"our first time there, and definitely not our last. We were able to get in without a reservation. Very luxurious decor, and first class washrooms. Excellent wine list and menu was well designed and organized. The staff was very attentive, and proper. We enjoyed the tomahawk steak and lobster and it was perfection. Prices were fair I thought, considering this is fine dining at its best. Wonderful way to spend an evening, fine dining.",Good,Good,Good
"This restaurant is at the Aria hotel. Our party of 8 went for their 3-course menu and food was excellent with a special mention for the main dish: 8oz filet mignon. All our orders where perfectly cooked and the side orders although expensive where excellent.  Very impressed with the service and the food and the staff were friendly and very knowledgeable about the wine selections.  Atmosphere of the restaurant was lacking a little as all tables of diners where spread out and the lighting was very low and too dark. Otherwise, excellent meal, but top end prices!",Good,Bad,Good
The food was very good and the service was excellent!! The lobster mashed potatoes were delicious!  Very nice dinner but a bit on the expensive side.,Good,Good,Good
"Our first trip to J-G. Service was perfect.  Steak was amazing.  Steaks came with a platter of sauces, which were good, but almost overkill.  Large portions.  Lobster Mashed Potatoes were to die for.",Good,,Good
"Service was far below par for a so called high end steakhouse. As far as I am concerned they need to up their game and treat a couple who pays $300 for a lousy steak with class instead of acting like they have it. Food from the salad to the desert failed. I guess the only thing good about it was the bottle of Pinot! Oh and the hostess was a sweetheart. 


Go somewhere else.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had a fine cut of ribeye here and the lobster mashed potatoes were incredible. The different steak sauces were also delicious.  We like the dark, quiet atmosphere and the decor.",Good,Good,
"The food is very good, we have nice dinner here yo can get wrong with this one but is expensive. Good wine selection",Good,,
"This is another great restaurant at Aria.
I went for their early evening 3-course menu and food was excellent with a special mention for the main dish: 8oz filet mignon. It was perfectly cooked medium rare.
It comes with five different sauces and they were all great.",Good,,
"We were with a small group and dined in a private area.
This meal was reserved in advance and one of our friends met with the chef and sommelier and planned our meal.
In a word..........Outstanding.
We had a 6 course gourmet meal with wine pairings that were spot on.
The service was second to none, the food was high grade, and the wines chosen were fantastic.  We are all still talking about this experience.
Thank you...Jason, Boris and Doris!",Good,Good,Good
"This is a ripoff spot, all they are interested in is your credit card, the service sucked. Normal Resturant refills kids cup of lemonade free, no, this place charges 7 dollars for each cup of refills.",Bad,,Bad
"Pre booked but it wasn't busy, food was excellent, service was excellent, had the shrimp wrapped in bacon, then the filet mignon with sides of green beans and creamey spinach, really enjoyed the experience.
Only downside, I was eating alone and was placed in the farthest corner out of the way, however this didn't spoil the experience.",Good,Good,Good
"We were staying at the Aria and decided to have dinner there instead of trying to find a place. The concierge arranged reservations and also show tickets for Zankara. Nice to have dinner and show right at the resort. The food was very good, we had a very friendly and knowledgable waiter. Yummy cocktails from the bar. They comp'd us an Anniversary dessert of the lava cake. Delicious!",Good,Good,Good
We have eaten in some first class restaurants in Vegas and this restaurant gives any of those a run for their money.  The tasting menu with wine was out of this world,Good,,
My party of 10 ate in a private room in Jean Georges Steakhouse at Aria recently and were very impressed with the service and the food. Most had filet mignon and said it was very tasty. The sauces that accompanied it were delicious. The truffle mac and cheese side dish was incredible. I found the service to be 5-star.,Good,,Good
The atmosphere is elegant without being pompous and stuffy. The service was impeccable. The food exquisite. Not cheap but worth every cent for a fine dining experience. Perfect for business.,Good,Good,Good
"The steak was very good here ( and we have tried a lot). Atmosphere of the restaurant was great with stylish decor and knowledgeable staff,",Good,Good,Good
"We went specifically to have a steak dinner. The staff were friendly and very knowledgeable about the food and wine selections. My steak was lovely apart from the fact it was very salty. We were excited to see some veg on the menu and ordered a side of spring green veg, but it had a chilli butter on it, which it really did not need. I like the fact they bring four sauces to the table for your steak including bernaise. Quite pricey, very dark inside...",Good,Bad,Good
"Overcooked, over seasoned and over priced.   Only saving grace was someone else paid.  Better steak at Texas Roadhouse.  Flemings and Mortons have nothing to fear.",Bad,,
Our experience here was fantastic from start to finish. The food was simply exquisite. A massive selection of wine. Service was top notch. Steak cooked to perfection. The atmosphere was really nice and the tables were far enough away that you didn't feel you were sharing with strangers.,Good,Good,Good
"Jean Georges at the Aria is a good choice for an upscale steakhouse when visiting Las Vegas. I recently went with two friends. I ordered the Signature Tasting Menu while they ordered a la carte. While the food was good, I would recommend ordering off the regular menu. 


I know portions on a tasting menu are supposed to be small, but I would say 3 of the 6 courses on the tasting menu are one-bite, amuse bouches rather than a course. That being said, they were tasty and well-presented. For example, the Osetra caviar in the meyer lemon gelee (see photo) was a one-bite delight. Since I had the tasting menu and my friends ordered off the menu, they combined some of my courses onto one plate. Not sure if I got shorted-ended because of that.


For example, the fourth and fifth course are described as ‚ÄúSeared Diver Scallops‚Äù and ‚ÄúGrilled Wagyu Filet Mignon (see photo). They combined these courses‚Äîand the scallops course was a single, bite-sized scallop with olive relish. Also, my filet, which was ordered mid-rare, was definitely rare in the center.


While those are small knocks, the overall dining experience was good. The d√©cor is modern and clean and the overall menu is what you would expect from an upscale, Vegas steakhouse.",Good,Good,
Steak/meat is ordered individually and then sides are shared. Great restaurant to get a quality meal and still control portions if you don't want to eat a lot before going out OR if you are a big guy and need a lot of fuel. Wine list is to die for. Turley Zinfandel was a great choice for our group.,Good,,
"Our company had over 50 people here for dinner one night.  We were given a limited menu with a couple of steaks, salmon, chicken along with salad and dessert and a number of sides for the table.  I wish we could have been seated together more, but it worked out fine.  The food was good, though I had already had a huge buffet at Caesar's for lunch!",Good,,
"My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary dinner and I have to say, I have never had a better steak in my life!! I had the 8oz filet mignon and if it had any bones in it, it would have fallen off the bone! When I took a bite, it melted in my mouth and just was so delicious.


On top of amazing food, the servers were incredible, friendly, personable people and they even gave us a complimentary chocolate lava cake and homemade ice cream with",Good,,Good
I went to Jean Georges for a business dinner. It was wonderful food. I had the scallops and cheesey mashed potatoes. Our wait staff was friendly and courteous. They had delicious martinis. Very pleased.,Good,Good,Good
"The meat looked as good as it gets. Of course for $58 ala carte for 8 ozs of filet it should look good. It was also excellent  after I sent the first one back. Right! I sent the first one back. I could not believe how much salt the cook, couldn't be the Michelin chef they rave about, put on this gorgeous piece of meat. Unforgivable, they won't see me again. I must compliment the server; Boris from the Bronx. Both he and his busboy were superb. I just don't go to really expensive restaurants touting their Michelin stars that don't deliver. Tellingly, Michelin no longer reviews Las Vegas restaurants.",Bad,,Good
Great food and service- Try the Tasting Menu with wine pairing.  Service was impeccable. Food was delicious.,Good,,Good
Overpriced and underwhelming.  The waiter was rude.  The steak was mediocre.  I laughed when they told us about the $320 6 ounce waygu.  I would not return.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"This is a very elegant restaurant with a sophisticated elegance not often found on the strip. This was our last night and as we were staying at Aria, we decided to make this a special night out, which it definitely turned out to be.  The service is attentive without being overwhelming. Our meals were exquisite, as was the wine.  Be prepared, this is an expensive restaurant but for a special night out, the experience is worth every cent.",Good,Good,Good
My Filet Mignon was cooked medium rare to perfection. Melt in your mouth and bursting with flavor. Excellent apps and sides. Swanky and hip interior with excellent service. Fun and enjoyable without the pretentiousness.,Good,Good,Good
Wined and dined here during a week stay in the aria in Las Vegas! A touch of class from start to finish with amazingly cooked food! With an extensive wine list and melt in the mouth steaks with multiple dipping sauces this place was a great treat!,Good,,
"Dinning with an event group of more than 60 people... I was expecting the usual from most restaurants... sub-par and lukewarm food thats been under heat lamps, or come out of the kitchen sporadically throughout dinner...  Not the case here!  Granted, we were dinning from a limited menu which is to be expected for such a large group... but everything came out on time, was very good and prepared perfectly.  Outstanding in my opinion, for such a large group!  Would definitely return to try dinner in a smaller setting.",Good,Good,
"We had a lovely meal inside the Aria's-Jean George's Steakhouse! Service is top-notch from the beginning! Our friendly and attentive server John did not hesitate to introduce himself and his associates that would be helping us through out dinner. That is a nice touch!  Yes, it's pricey here but your at the Strip in Vegas not downtown looking for a 99 cent breakfast. Our food was cooked to perfection and we had an excellent wine pairing. If you are looking to treat yourself to fine food and excellent service this is the jackpot with a romantic flare!",Good,Good,Good
The steaks were really good but I wasn't that impressed with everything for the price we paid. The mood was nice and the service was okay but nothing special for the price.,Good,Good,Good
"the steaks were excellent, very tasty and tender. The filet mignon I had was done perfectly! Pleasant Ambiance, servers were very helpful. A big plus is that the location of the restaurant is within the hotel.",Good,Good,Good
"We started out with drinks at the bar and then my wife and I were sat for dinner.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The wine selection is vast.  For dinner we went with the Fixed Price Menu,which included caviar, foie gras, scallops, filet, and desert.  Spectacular meal and experience.",Good,Good,Good
My wife and I had dinner here and enjoyed the steaks and service.  I had the filet cooked perfectly (charred rare) and my wife had the sirloin that was cooked perfectly.  We had a baked potato side that was huge and shared and she had a side salad.  The meat was flavorful and enough that she had to get a doggy bag! The bread served was interesting as they had some,Good,,Good
"My husband and I ate here for my birthday dinner. Food was AWESOME! However, it was pretty expensive- $420 for two with surf and turf ($100/each), Caesar salad ($16), potatoes ($18), and wine/drinks. Excellent service. 
Would go again, but probably only for a special occasion.",Good,,Good
"We had been really looking forward to our dinner at Jean Georges but left feeling a bit disappointed. Our biggest issue was with the service, who seemed annoyed when only one person ordered a drink and we didn't order appetizers. Also, when the photographer came around we took some pictures but when we decided not to buy any (they weren't our best) she seemed visibly angry with us. The food was just OK (though the short ribs were very good). All and all for the amount of money we would choose somewhere else.",Good,Bad,Bad
"My brother is a big steak fan so, along with my sister, the three of us decided on a recent trip to Vegas to go to Jean Georges at the Aria Hotel and Casino.  We selected a bottle of burgundy and all of us ordered the Filet Mignon.  Rare, Medium-Rare, and Medium and I have to say all 3 were about as perfect as could be.  They were all just as different as they should be but still tender and satisfying.  The appetizers were asparagas and baked potato we all shared and also were just perfect.


Looking for a good steak, you can't go wrong here.",Good,,
"Restaurant seemed busy for a Sunday, especially because it is hidden on the second level of Aria. First time stay at Aria and dining here. I have dined at Jean Georges in Manhattan. This is a more casual take, but enjoyed the contemporary style of service. Tempura spring onions as a side were awesome in addition to the steaks. Being a JG restaurant, I expected the steaks to be on point, which they were.",Good,Good,
Had business dinner with a group of 14 of us. The food was good as was the service but nothing out of the ordinary. Pleasant surrounding. The private room was comfortable and elegant.,Good,Good,Good
"Always look forward to the Jean Georges steakhouse at Aria because I can usually count on great food and great service. The food was great this time, but the service level was very disappointing.  


We waited quite some time after seating for our server to arrive with menus. Drink orders took forever. Our server allowed her telling us about specials to be interrupted so she could clarify order distribution for another table. The gaps between appetizer and main course was forever and I had to wave down someone to clear our main course so we could order desert. Overall, they appeared overwhelmed and inattentive ‚Äì and not just with our table but throughout our section of the restaurant.


With lots of great steak options available on the strip I‚Äôll have to evaluate other options.",Good,,Bad
"I ate here one night this week while on a company trip.  First of all, I made reservations through open table and found that to be an easy experience.


The service here was top notch to say the least.  The staff was extremely attentive, never let our glasses go even half way empty and they were very prompt if we needed them. (Shout out to the girl from Philadelphia, MS who waited on us)


Now the food - I ordered the oysters on the half shell and they were absolutely the best oysters I've ever eaten.  I wish I could have them flown to my house once a week!  I also had the filet and baked potato and although the potato was just a little dry, it was still good.  The filet was cooked perfectly for me (medium), melt in your mouth tender and not spiced with anything to take away the flavor.


I'd like to try other steakhouses in Vegas next time, but it will be hard not to return here.  Well done, Jean Georges, well done!",Good,Good,Good
"Very attentive and friendly wait staff.  The food was quite nice, but there was nothing memorable.  While I wouldn't necessarily seek out a return visit, I wouldn't object if someone else in the party wanted to dine here.  I ate primarily from side dish menu (creamed spinach, truffle mac n cheese, asparagus, and raw oysters - appetizer).  Again, all the food was really good but nothing so memorable to become a favorite of mine.",Good,,Good
"I was in Vegas for the weekend with a group of 11 friends and we decided to eat at Jean Georges in Aria for a fancy group dinner. Overall, I was not impressed. I've had better food and service at chain steakhouses like Flemings, or Saltgrass for that matter. Multiple people at our table were not happy with their steaks, they were either too fatty, too dry, too tough, or not cooked appropriately. My wife ordered the tenderloin medium well and it was completely bloody inside. It did have good flavor, but it was very dry for a tenderloin. Not every steak was terrible, I got a NY strip and though it was pretty good. Another thing that shocked me was that after the steaks were delivered, the waiter didn't ask anyone to cut into their steak to ensure it was cooked to their liking. He didn't even hang around long enough to make sure everything we ordered came out. We didn't hardly see our waiter during out entire dining experience, short of taking our order and dropping the bill. I'd like to add that our reservation was at 6pm, so the restaurant was not very busy. Our table spent over $1500 plus a $250 automatic gratuity and we were not thanked once for our patronage. Just about every hotel has a nice steakhouse restaurant, so I would recommend others try somewhere different since Jean Georges was very mediocre at best.",Bad,,Bad
We were there 2 weeks ago. Wonderful atmosphere with very nice menu. Delicious steak with Good...,Good,Good,Good
"Ordered the Prime Filet and was burnt to get medium. Tough and dry. Baked potato served lukewarm and with a minimal of toppings. Wife ordered the burger that she really enjoyed, but they never brought her side even after asking. I have ate at many high end steak houses in the past and this place was no better than an Outback. Should have went to Ruth Chris or Binions for a better meal.",Bad,Bad,
"My wife and I have been here several times, so we decided to show our kids one of our favorite places.


Upon our arrival, we were immediately and timely seated at a very good table.  Given that we were with our ""tween to 20 year old"" kids, this was a small, but pleasant surprise (we are usually relegated to the big table in a corner, even though our kids have always been polite and well-behaved in fine dining establishments).  Anyway, the service team was perfect from start to finish.  I don't know how to describe it better, so I won't try.


As for the food, this has been -- and was again -- one of the best steakhouse dinners I have ever enjoyed.  The meat was perfect, as expected, but there were no low points from appetizers through dessert.  The most memorable elements, though, are (1) a couple of the available sauces and (2) the background music.


I am old school when it comes to steaks:  If it needs a sauce, well, it must not be a particularly good steak.  However, although the meat didn't need a thing to make it just right, the soy miso and habanero sauces are incredible additions and should not be missed (NOTE: Keep in mind that these are strong flavors, and a little goes a long way).


The music was really a wonderful addition to the experience.  The 80's alternative music (Smiths, Tom Tom Club, Cure, etc.) created a relaxed, familiar atmosphere that further enhanced our time there.",Good,Good,Good
The atmosphere is open yet still allows you privacy to enjoy conversation along with an incredible menu and unique cocktail selection.  We will definitely be back,Good,Good,
"I see most people had excellent service. Where were they when our party of five was there. They were no where to be found. Our waiter seemed to be inconvenienced to serve any of us. Although some of the steak instructions were explicit, one came out wrong. I am not sorry: this steak should have been compensated. Nothing was done for the error. This particular guest not wanting to hold up the group from eating decided to take it as is. The main waiter had two assistants of which one was equally displeased with having to serve people. News flash: this is your job, and for the kind of money I am spending here you should at least sport a better attitude. Two of the steaks also came out warm meaning they were sitting somewhere before our inconvenienced waiter had time to bring them to us. This is completely unsatisfactory. In addition the bartender had attitude as well. The bar is right at the front door. The bartender should be an ambassador of good will to your restaurant. He was anything but that. We visited the French Bar directly next door, and what a difference: great service, great bartender, bending over backwards to see our needs were met, the bartender from the other side even helped as well, prompt arrival of the bill, and jolly pleasantries upon goodbye. We had none of that at Jean Georges.


I see a great many people love the place. How could our service and experience been so bad. Well, I have been going to Vegas for years, and yes the place has changed. They suck you in and grab your dollar and just dont care. When you are spending that kind of money you need to be serviced well---beyond well.


So to offset this horrible experience we went Casa Di Amore which is away from the Strip. What a difference. Great, personable service, piping hot food, great food, and a wonderful experience.


Jean Georges take a lesson from this place instead of just taking people's money. I will never return to Georges. I will go to the French Bar next door however. One is right on the money, and the other is so distant.


I wish i had grabbed the name of our waiter as i would put it in here so people know not to ever go this man. One of his support staff was great. She should have been the server.I cant even believe we tipped, but we inexplicably did. I was not in charge of the money.


The positive: the food was tasty, but it was not hot. Steaks need to come the table HOT. So I guess this is not a positive after all. I really have nothing positive to say. 


Also, they were 20 minutes behind on reservations. At places charging top dollar like here these things should not happen. There was not even an apology. It was like our fault, and we were ten minutes early.


Bottom line: go somewhere else",Bad,Bad,Bad
"STK was booked by the time I thought I wanted a steak and the Concierge recommend Georges, at the Aria, next to the Cosmopolitan where we were staying and handled the reservations for us.  You MUST pay the little bit extra and get the Australian beef.  We took our servers recommendation and weren't disappointed.  The suaces are awesome, the sides delicious, and everything we had was very good.  Pricey, but worth it.  Good wines too.",Good,,Good
"After a previous great meal we tried Jean George again and we were happy. 


Service and food was great,",Good,,Good
We arrived without a reservation late on a Tuesday evening and were offered the full menu at the bar which suited us perfectly. The steak was truly one of the best I've ever tasted and the service consistently excellent. Would recommend.,Good,Good,Good
"The food at Jean Georges was very good, but did not blow my mind. My husband's steak was cooked a perfect medium-rare and seared beautifully, however, I was not that impressed with the cut. I had the sea bass which was delicious. Again, the food was very good, definitely a solid choice, but not the best I've ever had. The cocktail menu was also quite good - I would recommend the Memory Lane cocktail with bourbon. Our server, Rachel, was very sweet, accommodating, and helpful. Thank you for a lovely evening.",Good,Good,Good
"We dined at Jean Georges our first night in Vegas so we had a small dinner (shared appetizer and shared steak with two sides) followed by dessert and a few glasses of wine.  First and foremost, service is excellent.  They approach each table from a team perspective and were perfectly happy with us having a light meal (I've run across those that get irritated when you don't each order app/entree/dessert, etc for tip reasons...).  Shared steak was great (they present each table with a variety of sauces).  Shrimp cocktail app was excellent as well.  Overall 8-9/10.",Good,,Good
"We always celebrate with a nice dinner when in Vegas, and Jean George's can deliver!  Try to the jalapeno fritters if they are the special the night you go!  Maybe a little pricey, but worth it.  Melt in our mouth steaks ;)",Good,,
"So glad we finally decided to dine at Aria. We always stay there but never have dined there. I think we picked the best restaurant there! Everything was perfect. My husband had the Wagyu Filet Mignon ( A MUST TRY) and I had the salmon and we split the Black Truffle Mac & Cheese. The sauces that come with the Wagyu were awesome. Even used them for my salmon. The salmon was okay not to rave about. I would go with a meat option if you dine here. It was my birthday and they brought out a wonderful treat which was a very nice surprise. The atmosphere is perfect, the vibe is great, the service is awesome too! I think this a great",Good,Good,Good
"Very nice restauarant, with a good menu and reasonable portions. The waitress that served us was a true professional. She knew her menu and managed to satisfy all our special requests. The carrot cake was also a great finish for the meal.",Good,Good,Good
"Jean George is the man!  Simply put - if you like steak, this is your place.  Don't take my word for it, just read the other reviews.  The quality and preparations are decadent.  High end.  This place will likely dent your wallet, but hey - it is totally worth it.",Good,Good,Good
"This is a high end place with terrific food and solid-service.  It's pricey so be prepared to spend (we spent $550 for four of us)


Servers were extremely professional but a little too heavy on the sales-side. I felt they were always trying to talk you into adding on to your order etc to inflate the bill.


Overall we were very happy. The music was too loud in the restaurant.  It didnt enhance our visit...just created an irritation.",Good,Bad,Good
"The room is lovely, the service was top of the line and the steak was amazing. I have been to many restaurants in Vegas and I have to say that our meal was exceptional. The steak was cooked to perfection and the salad and shrimp cocktail were wonderful as well. I highly recommend this restaurant.",Good,Good,Good
"Terrible experience: waaayyy overpriced, my tempura calamari was so greasy my stomach was already churning when the entree arrived.  Although the scallops were beautifully cooked the dish was too salty and heavily flavoured.  Salt seems to be the favoured spice. Sometimes less is more J-G!  And what's with all the sauces??
Don't get me started on the alcohol! $75 for a bottle of average wine?!  Come on! I almost cried when the bill cameüò• Never again!",Bad,Bad,
"We enjoyed an excellent meal here, all three couples enjoyed a variety of choices from the menu, from seafood to beef. We unanimously found our choices to be too salty for our taste, so if you are watching your salt intake for health reasons, you probably should look elsewhere. Make sure you have plenty of room on your credit card!",Good,,
"The service is good, nothing great but nothing need to be complain about. We were sitting beside two big group so it was quite noisy. 


The food is great, the Wagyu beef was done very nicely. I like that they provide variety of sauces, each of the sauce bring out a different favor of the beef. 


Unless you are a steak lover, but for this price tag, I think there are other fine dining options to choose in Vegas.",Good,,Good
"Yes, you heard that right KOBE Beef, certified and imported from Japan...not American or Australian Wagyu but the real deal Kobe beef. So yes, it was quite expensive but cheaper than a flight to Japan :)


I really wanted to try the Signature Tasting Menu but was not that hungry so I ordered the Broiled Rock Lobster which was cooked to perfection. My husband ordered the Kobe Beef and Rock Lobster. Both cooked to perfection and the beef was like butter! For a starter we ordered the Wagy Beef Carpaccio a for a side dish we shared the Black Truffle Mac & Cheese...you must order these dishes! 


Great service, great food! If you always wanted to try Kobe, this is the place!",Good,Good,Good
"I had an excellent Wagyu Filet Mignon to the point with roasted trumpet mushrooms, hand cut french fries, and a selection of sauces. The food was delicious and of high quality. As I had not reserved a table I was eating alone at the bar, but was highly entertained by the staff. I see that other reviewers were not completely satisfied with the service. However, I received my food timely and always with a smile. Also I got very good recommendations on wines.
The interior has a lot of gold and brown tones, with low, intimate illumination. 
The Jean Georges would get a perfect rating from me if it had windows to see the Strip or the night sky. But otherwise I highly recommend it.",Good,Good,Good
"It's the best steakhouse I've been especially it's managed by the top star michelin chef. Service was about excellent to make me feel home and helpfully recommended us what to try and drink. When I want my beef to be cooked in rare, IT'S SERVED RARE AND HOT! 
I don't know if there's a steakhouse better than JG in U.S, but it's become my favorite place for a laid back family dinner as well as entertaining business client.
Perfect",Good,Good,Good
"Great service from the arrival, shown to a nice table well ""dressed"". The waiter was quick in serving us and the steak was great. if I retun to Vegas I would eat hear again.",Good,Good,Good
"Excellent steaks - one of the best I have had and I have been to many steak houses, although pricey. Steak was cooked to the exact temperature requested. apps were very good with great flavor. I thought the steak sauces were good. Service was outstanding.",Good,,Good
"There are about a million better places in Vegas.
Put it this way - the Mash Potatoes are bad..... Mashed potatoes.
You can just do way better in terms of food and ambience in Vegas. 
A lot of places can make a get streak - but this restaurant's ""thing"" is the multitude of steak sauces.......think about that.
No View - this is Vegas.
For 5 bucks you can be at Gordon Ramsay, Hide, or even The Palm for gods sake.
Please don't",Bad,Bad,
"Wine list is superb and the food was sensational.  I love lobster at a steak house and this was as moist, plum; and sweet as could be!!  The sides of truffle mashed potatoes and truffle mac and cheese were the perfect portions.  My husbands filet was cooked exactly as it was asked to be and came with four amazing sauces",Good,,
"Ridiculously expensive but excellent steak and seafood.  Started the evening right with the seafood tower and it was probably the best I have ever had.  The quality, the freshness and the quantity of the seafood on the tower was amazing.  Again, at a hefty price.  Ordered the filet for my entree which was perfectly cooked.  I normally avoid any additional sauces with my steaks but we were provided a selection of four house made sauces and I succumbed to the temptation.  While the steak absolutely did not need the sauce, the sauce was delicious and enhanced the experience.  Not a big fan of the modern surroundings in regards to ambiance but this is Vegas and what you would expect.  I have been to many great steakhouses and Jean Georges is fantastic.  I do not mind paying for a quality meal but $18-$19 for side dishes (mash potatoes) which are not even ""family style"" portions is a bit much and over the top.  All in all, a great experience but keep your credit card near....you're going to need it.",Good,Good,
"The service was great but the steak in this steak house was awful!
It was tuff and way over priced....
I've had better steak at the outback...
No seriously 
Mortons has the best steak 
The blackened Cajun ribeye to die for!!!",Bad,Bad,Good
"The Jean Georges is a top class steakhouse, certainly the best I've ever been to in Las Vegas. It comes at a price, but it is certainly worth it: The beef was excellent (great quality, cooked perfectly), as were the side dishes. The atmosphere is very calm and a bit removed from the usual Vegas crazyness. And while I've come to terms with the facts that in the US service is sometimes terrible even at the most upscale of places, that's certainly not the case here: We had an excellent and helpful waitress who most of all was knowledgable about the food and just very down to earth in how she dealt with us (none of that fake-ness you so often find). I'll certainly go back to this restaurant and can recommend it to anyone. (Additional 'fun fact': I've never ever seen a menu with a bottle of wine priced at over 38'000 USD, and that alone was almost worth the visit. Crazy, but I guess that's also Vegas for you.)",Good,Good,Good
"Just to start I've never had a Bad at Aria from gambling, dining or accommodation. The restaurant does not let you down in any way. It is your classic steakhouse with chilled seafood appetizer, which is superb, and great cuts of meat to suit any taste. The atmosphere was lively and the noise level standard. The only detractor is in the sauces that accompanied the entrees. Honestly they weren't good and the steak did not need them. I highly recommend avoiding the additional sauces.",Good,Good,
"Service, ambience and all food items were 100% perfect! It is an expensive place to eat but I feel the money spent was entirely worth it!",Good,Good,Good
"I am 40 years old and this is the best food I have ever eaten! We had the tasting menu and it was absolutely amazing! Perfectly cooked, perfectly timed, perfect service! The decor and ambiance were superb!",Good,Good,Good
"This is a place we have wanted to try for years and so we did and it was a great evening with unbelievable attention to detail, that fine dinning should be. Try the surf and turf along with unbelievable lobster mashed potatoes and scallops. It is on the higher side of prices but worth every bite. Thank You.",Good,Good,Good
"We started with Caesar Salads and they were great, the bread basket was even better.  We both had the Beef Tenderloin, cooked to perfection, it was to die for.  For dessert I had the chocolate cake with ice cream and my husband had the cheesecake.  Both delicious.  Joseph was a perfect waiter, took great care of us and very personable.",Good,Good,Good
New very modern Steakhouse in the Aria Hotel & Casino. Very cool style and atmosphere with a live DJ. I have eaten at a lot of steakhouses all over the world and this was one of the best steaks I ever had. It's pricey with a side of fries at $14. But it's still worth paying the extra money one night while in Vegas. You certainly don't come to Vegas to save money.,Good,Good,
"Let's face it, the steakhouses in Vegas are plentiful and have a hard time distinguishing themselves from one another.  Jean Georges is not much different but they do a good job. Atmosphere was modern and cozy and the noise level was a bit above average.  Our two servers well were versed in the menu and were very forthcoming with their recommendations. Initially we felt a little rushed but once I told them that we are not in a hurry and plan to spread things out, they were attentive without being pushy.  Everyone in our party had seafood so I cannot speak to the steaks. The Se Bass was some of the best I have had. Drink pours were good and portions of everything were reasonable for the price.  Dinner for 3 with cocktails and $150 bottle of wine was $610 plus tip. Not the most expensive we have been to but not a cheap meal by any stretch.  Lots of comparable choices in Vegas but I would go back if the opportunity arises.",Good,Good,Good
"I will start off by saying that I realize it is not fair to write a review of a restaurant that I never ate at. I've written many many reviews on this website for many hotels and restaurants, so I felt the need to make a comment on this one.


We were in Las Vegas for the weekend, and booked a reservation at this restaurant for 7 PM. We ladies went to pick up our husbands at the sports book, and they took quite a while to get paid out on their bets. Therefore, we were 18 minutes late for our reservation. When we went up to the hostess desk, we were told that our table had been given away. I have made many reservations in my life, and have been a bit late for many. I have never,‚Ä¶ ever been turned away before. 


Suffice to say that I understand we were in the wrong, but I would not return or recommend based on what I   feel is poor customer care and service. They didn't even try to get us a table, or even discuss it, just told us our table was given away...end of story. Nice...:(",,Bad,Bad
"Nice atmosphere, romantic. We had a reservation and were seated quickly. Waiter was very attentive and knew the menu very well. 


Now to the food--tartare was good but not the best I have had. Tomato salad was good but when comparing to the brussel sprout salad at Sage..it doesn't even come close. Burrata Mozzarella salad was good. Bacon wrapped shrimp were dry, Tempura calamari were very good, bbq ribs were so yummy.


Dinner--Filet Mignon was good but not great, Wagyu filet was very good, sides were all good but not great.


For Vegas, I think you can do much better.",Good,Good,Good
"Without a doubt the best meal I've had in Vegas this trip. Despite been 45 minutes late for our booking, we were seated relatively quickly. Complimentary breads were to die for, tempura calamari appetiser was incredibly light & tasty & Veal for my main was superb. Advice on wine wasn't the waiters strong suit (it was an awful recommendation) so stick to the wine that you know. Will be going back when next i visit.",Good,Good,
"we ate at Jean George whilst staying at the Aria Las Vegas. We ate there to celebrate our 4oth wedding anniversary. The restaurant has great atmosphere, and was the perfect venue. The service was impeccable, and the steak was certainly the best I have ever had. Had we been able to afford it, we would have gone again, but it was a great place for a special day.",Good,Good,Good
"Caviar balanced with a Lemon Gelee, Seared Diver Scallop, Short Rib with Smoked Chili Glaze, and the Wagyu Filet were magnificently prepared. The wine pairing was inexpensive and were wines equal to the pricing. I'd consider spending a little more and getting a Bordeaux-style that is as luscious as the food.  The Moscow (House) Mule was amazing with fresh crushed ginger and soda in lieu of Ginger Beer.  Nice!!",Good,,
"Visited during the Christmas Holidays and was recommend  to this place by Aria's Concierge. And it was a good thing we did, it was a fantastic meal, compare to Gordon Ramsy Steakhouse over in Paris Paris! 
The best was the 18oz Bone In Rib Eye that they could even charcoal grill it and my wives Sea Bass was delicious as well.
The service level here was impeccable and definitely would come back here on my next Vegas trip to try out the tasting menu! 
I would highly recommend anyone to try this steakhouse out if you happen to stay in Aria and can't decide on what to eat for the night!",Good,Good,Good
"Great service, Good, wonderful experience.  I loved it and I'm picky and they went out of their way.",Good,Good,Good
We wanted a good steak and some good wine We got both Unfortunately it appeared  we took too long to eat our meal .I was still finishing my meal whilst the table staff cleared the table in front of me AND I am not referring to just removing the other diners plates They were removing table mats and cutlery Now we may not have been big spenders but we still spent $600 for one course and wine We were a table of 4 The restaurant was not busy and it was not exceptionally late We sat down just after 9 so it was close to 11 but this is a casino restaurant !!! My guests questioned whether I would leave a tip but  I still chose to leave 10% because the other staff shouldnt be ignored because 2 members of staff would do better working in a roadside diner However it does suggest that the restaurant management is lacking something if they can stand by and watch this happen It ruined the evening and I didnt finish my meal as the incident killed the moment. I would have given the evening a Very Good rating if hadnt been for this incident The table staff  merit a Terrible rating but the kitchen and bar staff certainly merit more So I chose Average To conclude this restaurant has fallen into the trap that Vegas is about the money You dont go there to expect Good This restaurant certainly doesnt respect the customer and you would do better to go else where. I will be back in Vegas but not to this restaurant There are some great steakhouses in Vegas and some really do know how to make the customer feel special  Sadly Jean Georges is not one of them My tip is AVOID !,,Bad,Bad
"Nearly every time we are in Las Vegas we head to Jean Georges for the early bird dinner (5 - 7 pm).  Currently it is $69 for 3 courses worth about $90.  The restaurant is very quiet at this time and the service is wonderful.  We had an heirloom tomato salad, beef tenderloin and dessert.  You can add a side dish if you wish, but with the great bread basket we never find it necessary.  Very nice wine list, even their wine by the glass has some good choices.",Good,Good,Good
"Ate here twice on this visit, and once before last May.  Beyond perfection - food, wine and service.  The atmosphere is great too.  Perfect service but not overdone.  Love the steaks, short rib, bread tray, amazing Caesar salad.  We loved the mini apple pie in the cast iron skillet.  Incredible.  Love this place! Will come back every time we get a chance.  Brad was an exceptional server.",Good,Good,Good
"Second visit and this time I had steak only. It was top quality beef cooked to perfection, served with 4 deifferent sauces (personally, I missed apepper sauce). Definitely among Vegas' top 5 steakhouses",Good,Good,
"I have been to Prime at the Bellagio many times, and although Jean Gorges is a sister restaurant, it is miles above Prime in my opinion.  The service was great, although the hostesses could look a little more excited and should smile a bit more.  For apps we had the tempura calamari with Sriracha foam, the calamari was very tender and the batter was delicious.  Tuna tartare was excellent, not too strong of flavors.  The burrata and heirloom tomatoes were also pretty good. 


For the mains, we had the 18oz o bone in ribeye, it was cooked very well and had very good char and grill marks, you could taste a hint of the wood fire oven they used.  The regular rib eye was also excellent.  The sauces were well done, and they gave you 4 to choose from: soy-miso, house made steak sauce, bernaise, and some habanero sauce that had a nice kick to it. 
For dessert , the cheesecake was great, not overly sweet and came with a very nice sour cherry sorbet, usually how i like to end my meals. All in all, great service and excellent steaks. Would go again over Prime.",Good,Good,Good
So many good things about this place.  The salt and pepper baked potatoes are superb.  My filet was cooked perfectly!  Michael and Gary are the best bartenders ever!  They make a delicious dirty martini and perfect margaritas.  I always go back every chance I get.,Good,Good,Good
Three of us ate at the Steakhouse.  It was marvelous.  The service was impeccable.  The wine was very reasonable and the food was great.  I had grilled lobster.  It was delicious!,Good,Good,Good
When we go to Las Vegas we like to try one new restaurant.  Jean Georges is not your typical steakhouse.  We started with the Tempura Calamari with Chili Dip.  Then the most surprising was the Baby Iceburg Salad.  We weren't expecting anything extraordinary but the bacon on the salad was fabulous.  Two very thick slices with an amazing flavor.  I even asked the waiter about the bacon and he said it was Neuske's.  My husband had the NY Srip and I had the filet both done perfectly with a very tasty soy-miso butter sauce.  The side of black truffle mac & cheese was to die for.  Needless to say there was no room for dessert.,Good,,
Really really Good!  Menu is nicely balanced.  Perfect dinner spot after the show.  I personally loved the art decor(steer noses) :)  Very elegant but still hip.,Good,Good,
"Great wine list per bottle, not s nice by glass...but a great place overall. Good in a beautiful hotel.",,Good,Good
"I typically do not entertain a $$ or $$$ price range in my search of restaurants and because we did not research this one before making the reservation, I was a bit shell shocked by the menu prices when we first sat down. The regular steaks ranged in prices from $58 to $75 with sides in the $15-$18 range. I got the 12 oz New York Strip with a side of mashed truffles potato. The steak was perfectly cooked and one of the best I've ever had, the sauces brought to sample with the stead were excellent. All in all a great meal for the start of a guys night out.",Good,Good,
Rae for me to give a 5. But our meal was outstanding. I've eaten at many steak houses and this was the best steak I've had in years. Bone-in ribeye. Special side was lobster and potatoes - wonderful change form the now-common macaroni lobster. Total of 8 of us and everyone loves the meal. Highly recommend although it is very expensive so it's more appropriate for special occasions.,Good,Good,
Really loved the food but would have liked to have eaten a bit earlier (our fault should have booked). A little expensive when comparing to other steakhouses.,Good,,
"Had a party of 9 eat at Jean George's.  Food and wine selections were excellent.  Service was rushed and had to ask them to slow down and stop interrupting us so much.  But they were very attentive.  All-in-all, a very Good.",Good,Good,
We have eaten at many great restaurants on the Vegas Strip. This was one of the best meals we have ever had. If you are staying on the property this place is a must if you want a great celebration/romantic dinner.,Good,Good,
We tried this steakhouse in the Aria hotel for our anniversary dinner. We selected it due to its good reviews and it was close to where we were staying. We found the wait staff attentive yet unobtrusive.They had excellent knowledge of the wine list and the evening special entrees. As far as the food we were slightly disappointed. The steaks were a bit overcooked compared to what we usually receive at a finer restaurant. The al a carte sides were unremarkable and the amount was small for sharing between guests.,Bad,,Good
"One of Vegas best steakhouses. They have an excellent menu and side dishes. Great wine selection. The place is very dark, but the ambiance is nice overall. Very expensive but well worth it for a night on the town.",Good,Good,
"If you like steak ( and have access to lots of funds), please consider a visit to Jean Georges Steakhouse at the Aria Hotel.  I had the Wagyu Filet Mignon, and it was everything you want it to be a flavorful, melt in your mouth experience. We  also shared the Glazed Short ribs as an appetizers;  decadent...yes..but oh so good.


Our waitress was extremely knowledgable and friendly.  She made excellent recommendations for sides and wine.  She really made us feel comfortable-- and that is not always the case in Vegas.


Warning:  Bring your winnings from the tables, or a large credit line.. because it is very, very pricey.   However, do indulge if you can, and if you love beef.  You will not be disappointed with the experience.",Good,,Good
"Its not my fav steakhouse in vegas but its a good place to spend a dinner with friends. I had a really good burger with truffle fries. Im not touched but I can say that is a good place, u can try it",Good,,
"The meal was exceptional. Food, first rate. Service, the same. Great wine list. Decor, modern chic was pleasant. On my list for a return visit.",Good,Good,Good
"This should be a fabulous restaurant.  Although buried deep in the bowels of the Aria hotel, we eventually found it.  Looks like its more oriented towards the conference crowd.  We had a 7:30 reservation and were seated immediately.  We had the filet mignon and short rib entree's.  Both were well cooked and tender.  Seasoning was good.  Then there were the side dishes...OMG!! The asparagus were perfectly grilled, but inedible because they were so salty.  I was refunded this item by the waitress.  The truffle mac and cheese was also nicely done, but again, nearly inedible due to the salt.  The wait staff was over-attentive, constantly filling the wine and water glasses, removing plates immediately after they are mostly eaten.  Even wiping down the table while we were finishing our wine.  We couldn't believe it, thought we were in a diner.   I wish high end restaurants in the US would learn how to properly wait tables in the european tradition, which is to linger and not be pressured to finish your meal.  Overall a less than perfect experience at what should have been a great evening for a $300 meal.   We wont be back.",Bad,Bad,Good
"Ate dinner a few days ago, the ""steakhouse"" was misrepresented and was in fact was a sports bar showing big screen sports. We had Wagyu fillet steaks $65.00 each and both were rolled in salt, this I was assured was seasoning but it dried out an excellent cut of beef to that of shoe leather. One was rare it looked rare on the inside of the salt crust but no lovely juices. Just completely ruined a what should have been superb steak, The Kobe steak was $600 each, god knows what they would have done to that. Sides were amazingly expensive $12.00 for fries $16.00 for mushrooms, remember its a sports bar.",Bad,,
The bone in rib eye was cooked to perfection as well as the organic chicken with the heavenly lobster mashed potatoes. Our table is always ready and we never wait long at all when we have a reservation.,Good,,
Amazing filet. The sauces are extraordinary. Try the mushrooms and Brussels sprouts as sides. Beautiful ambience in the restaurant,Good,Good,
"Our dinner was absolutely delicious. But was it worth it? I had the 12 oz NY Strip ($54). My friend,  the 10 oz Filet Mignon (also $54). We shared 2 sides: Truffle Mashed Potatoes (a puny serving at $18) and Grilled Asparagus ($16). The meat came with 5 sauces (Homemade Hot Sauce, Soy-Miso Butter, B√©arnaise, JG Steak Sauce, and spicy green). Everything was exquisitely prepared  and all the sauces perfectly complemented the meat without overpowering them. The staff's level of attention was just right. The restaurant was quiet enough for easy conversation. We left Jean Georges quite satisfied, but we would have been much happier if we got lucky in the casino in order to afford our dinner.",Good,Good,Good
"Another one of my regular Vegas steakhouses and I've been visiting this one since the year it opened but it's different to the likes of Craftsteak.


For a start all steaks are cooked over a wood burner and this imparts a different flavour on the steaks. I've tried the filet, Ribeye, NY strip and the short rib, I always go back to the NY strip. Lots of flavour for a cut that is still relatively lean.


Side dishes are great, a little small for the price but I guess that's vegas.


One negative is the beer list over the last 12 months seems to have degraded but with Todd English and other places nearby it's not the end of the world.


I/we always sit at the bar with Darren &/or Mike looking after us, they are both very good and always look after us.",Good,,Good
"It took almost four hours for dinner, service was slow, the food really isn't that great.  As a foodie, I did not understand the hype.  The bartender was rude and so was the manager...avoid, not worth what they charge",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We have dined at Jean Georges at Aria, Las Vegas, perhaps 15 times and never been disappointed.  My wife and I sit at the bar for dinner, where Gary always takes good care of us.  Everything on the menu is excellent, but the steaks (served with an array of four sauces) and short ribs are especially noteworthy, as are the Caesar salad and the side of truffle macaroni & cheese.  Not inexpensive, but well worth the prices charged.",Good,Good,Good
Very Good and wine  quality. The waiters are very friendly and you have time to eat without hurry. The restaurant is very expensive.,Good,,Good
This is a typical nice steakhouse on the slightly more expensive side while clearly expensive. The atmosphere was very nice except for the large drunk party which was seated in the center of the restaurant which was not our servers fault of course. I wish there was a way restaurants could deal with rude customers.  It was clearly well designed and upscale as expected in the aria resort. The steak was great as it should be and the sides were good but tiny so beware.,,Good,
"We were very excited to try Jean Georges and booked reservations through the Aria concierge for a Saturday evening. We were immediately seated but then proceeded to wait almost 10 minutes for anyone to come take our drink orders even though it wasn't ridiculously busy. We then tried asking the waiter for differences in the meat options and he had quite a pompous attitude while minimally answering our questions. The food was brought out very quickly and was superb. We are frequent Vegas visitors and enjoy dining at the finer restaurants so the prices are not a surprise to us so we fully realized that we would be paying quite a lot for this meal. However, when you are paying these prices along with that comes the expectation of a certain class and level of service which was sadly lacking during our dinner at Jean Georges. With all of the amazing dining options available in Vegas, I don't expect to return here a second time.",Good,,Bad
Good overall menu with lots of choices. Steaks were terrific but the short ribs were amazing. I did not use my knife at all they were so tender. Coupled with a side of marrow bones and I thought I was still in France. Highly recommended.,Good,,
"Expensive but definitely worth it : best steak I ever had!


Super friendly staff: asked for a cocktail not on the menu and the staff went the extra mile just to make it. Really appreciated!",Good,,Good
"Ok steakhouse, nothing memorable about it.  


We had Chilean sea bass and braised short rib. Both were very good, but the dining experience was average.  Salads were huge.  The bacon wrapped shrimp was delicious.


We decided to try this restaurant for our anniversary, since they closed American Fish next door, which was our favorite restaurant.  Not sure if we would go back.",Good,,
"When I come with 10 people and ask for 2 tables of 5, don't force us to one big table and then demand that only 7 credit cards can be taken for payment. You ruined the entire experience for everyone.",,Bad,Bad
"The best way to describe this place was OMG!! I loved the Steak had a 10oz Filet, mushrooms and potatoes the steak needed nothing extra was amazing all by itself. Services out of this world great atmosphere LOVED!!!!",Good,Good,Good
"Wow was I shocked by the dried out tasteless NY Strip I was served here.  A companion said his ribeye had no flavor either.  Pretty rare that I have to give such a low rating to a restaurant but at their prices I expected so much more.


Our service was good but it did take a long time for food to arrive (not her fault).


Last night I had a $20 steak at Pizzeria Uno that blew this meal away...sorry Jean-George.",Bad,Bad,Good
"This restaurant had great atmosphere, didn't have Good and it was pricey which is fine if you feel well taken care of. Other than that it was a fun night, the food was really good and the place is beautiful. I'll have to go back and hopefully will have better luck.",Good,Good,Bad
"Give you a pleasant dinning experience trying the exclusive menu at night. Burrata with tomatos, Steak and Ginger Ale will make you passionate about food in Vegas.",Good,Good,
"Had high expectations for a restaurant with a $400 bill attached to it. We did the tasting menu with the wine pairing. Not an overly busy night, just steady. First 3 courses arrived within 25 minutes, had to request that they slow it down a bit, which the waiter accommodated. Everything was good, but not great.....waygu beef was the exception. It is supposed to be the highlight of the dinner, arrived cooked as ordered, REALLY tender, but was WAY over peppered by the chef. Even after scraping off as much as we could, that was all we tasted. Disappointing. Not the special experience we had hoped for. Won't be back again, lots of better options at lower price point.",Bad,Bad,
"Jean Georges was firing on all cylinders last night.  The staff was friendly and welcoming.  We were seated immediately on arrival.  The decor is a cross between old school steakhouse and modern LAs Vegas.  
Our party had salads, cocktails, steaks and wine with dinner.  The service was accurate and timely.  Our waiter and assistant made good recommendations for the table.  We ordered the tomahawk ribeye, filet and New York strip steaks.  Out fourth had the sea bass.  All the steaks were perfectly cooked.  Accompanying sauces were good, but unnecessary.
All told it was a great meal.  Atmosphere was nice for table discussion as well.
I highly recommend Jean Georges if you are looking for a steakhouse.",Good,Good,Good
"We stumbled across this little place late one night, it wasn't overly busy so we opted for a seat at the bar to have our meal.
We had sushi and sashimi to start which was delicious and then we both ordered the steaks with the creamy mash - oh my word - best most succulent steak I have ever eaten and the mash was just melt in the  mouth - amazing - wish I had had time to go for  second night!!",Good,Good,
"OUr meal was just divine.  Cooked just right - really enjoyed how the sides were served √∂n the side"" so you could take however much you wanted.
Service was great - very efficient staff.",Good,,Good
"We were with two other couples dining on Sunday evening, August 31, 2014. We had arrived earlier in that day; walking the Hotel and enjoying our first day.  We had eaten in the early afternoon, and had early reservations at the Jean Georges. Upon arriving a little early we had a drink at the bar, before being seated. I mention this because the source of our problem that night was a result of us not ordering enough alcohol at the table to please our server. Also, I know servers never like for patrons to split an entr√©e, but one couple did, as we all weren't starving. In their defense, the guy ordered a salad and they ordered a side,as well. I've been around the service industry for over 20 years and also have direct family members in the business including a son who a certified CMS (adv.) sommelier. My buddy chose an $85 Pinot Noir, and you could see the life bleed out of our servers eyes.  Then, when the floor sommelier brought and poured our wine; there wasn't one word.  I asked him about his certification, naturally, as I recognized his lapel pin.  His one word answer was so low I couldn't even hear him.  So, I asked again.  This time I heard his one word answer, but not another word, and he was gone.  Really.  He was exactly what the new breed of younger somms are trying to get away from- the old stuffy wine snob image.  But I think, based on my experiences, he wasn't going to engage patrons over a paltry $85 bottle of juice. Sad. Some of did order more wine, but by the glass. Same thing when one couple ordered the split entr√©e. You could see our server's shoulders sag.  He would recover between those times and overall, the service was fast enough, but he should've never allowed us to notice; and we all did.  I know by Vegas standards, our 6-top didn't produce they way he would've liked, but it was still hundred of dollars we spent there that night, and that doesn't count our drink at the bar.  The food was okay.  Our steaks didn't have the char on the outside you hope to get at a nice restaurant, but they were at least cooked to the correct doneness.  We will be back to the Aria; but will look elsewhere for fine dining.  Too bad.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Great little restaurant reminded me of the Gaucho chain in UK.  The downside was the execution.  My starter of ribs was luke warm at best, my main of steak went back as the chef couldn't get to grips with rare!  The second attempt wasn't so great either.  My wife on the other hand loved her soy glazed ribs and said it was the best food she'd ever eaten.  The service was great and we left a decent tip to show that.  The sad thing about strip eateries are that they mostly trade on location and rarely live up to their glossy show pieces on the hotel tv's",Bad,Good,Good
"Had our daughters reception at Jean George's Steakhouse. Jack, the Restaurants captain, was the best thing since sliced bread! Everyone raved about the food, the service, the drinks...and the bathrooms...you just have to go there and see!!!",Good,Good,Good
Enjoyed an anniversary meal for my sister and brother in law. Food and service excellent and they served an anniversary cake with our coffee.,Good,Good,Good
"First time in my life that I had a Tomahawk Steak and it was delicious.  Service was amazing, but the sides left something to be desired.  All of the side dishes were over salted including the mack and cheese.",Good,,Good
"We visited JG's on our honeymoon and were absolutely delighted with the food. Everything we ate was absolutely fantastic and delivered with excellent all-American service as you would expect. 


To start we had the bacon wrapped shrimp and tuna tartare, which were both absolutely fantastic. Perfectly seasoned and delicious. We both had the NY Strip steak for main - one of the best steaks we have had. The steaks are huge, but perfectly charred on the outside and juicy in the middle. We had a selection of sides - creamed spinach, mashed potatoes with blue cheese, fries and asparagus which were also fantastic, it was a shame the hearty portions beat us! Wine was also excellent. 


As we were on our honeymoon, the staff prepared us a special congratulatory dessert which was a lovely touch. 


One point knocked off as the atmosphere was a little lacking - that may have been as we ate on a Tuesday night though.",Good,Bad,Good
"Was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews and I have to say they were unwarranted! We were seated promptly and our drink orders taken. It was fun to look at the wine menu on an iPad! The wait staff, while always hovering nearby, were never obtrusive or made us feel like we had to hurry. I ordered a small filet which was cooked perfectly and split a baked potato and asparagus with my husband. His ribeye was also cooked perfectly and he also enjoyed his order of bone marrow! An assortment of sauces were brought to the table to accompany our steaks. Last but not least, the desserts were fantastic! My husband enjoyed a warm chocolate cake while I had the churros. They came with ice cream and a chocolate sauce. Not at all as sweet as you would think! All in all, our dinner was excellent and would highly recommend this restaurant!",Good,Good,Good
Don't overlook this great steakhouse.  Food and service were very good!  Wait staff was attentive but not intrusive.  We had plenty of time to enjoy our meal.  Decor and ambience is very nice.  I do wish that there was some semblance of a dress code.  It is disconcerting to be dressed nicely and find yourself seated next to a goober wearing shorts with his shirt tail out.  Civility and decorum are scarce commodities.,Good,Good,Good
"Come here for a classic Vegas dinner after a nice run at the casino - with a hunger for meat and with deep pockets. My strip steak was very good, cooked med-rare exactly the way I wanted it. the cheeseburger was really good, and so were the starters - prawn cocktail and caesar salad. The wine menu is ridiculously expensive, but the one red glass I had (local Zinfandel) was actually good. Great service all along. The decor is terrible, though",Good,Bad,Good
"Go for early dining from 5-7 and pay $69.00 for 3 course dinner (salad, steak or chicken, dessert).  Went with my two teenage kids and husband.  We all had enjoyable meals.  Tried the burgers and steaks and everything was delicious.  The entrees don't come with sides.  Sides are extra.  Check their menu online to get familiar.  Drinks range from $11 and up.  Be prepared to pay $$$.  Would go back.  My daughter loves australian steak (she had it in thailand) and this was only place I could find!",Good,Good,
Went to Jean Georges for our nephews wedding. What an experience. One of the best meals I have ever had. Now it is quite expensive but certainly worth the money. Would love to go there again but I will have to win the lottery first.,Good,Good,
"As I walked in the restaurant with my wife and daughter, I couldn't help noticing the wear and tear on the chairs and tables of this purportedly upscale restaurant. As soon as I sat on my chair I realized the furniture was not just old looking, it was very uncomfortable as well. The peeling wood laminate on the tables was an unexpected  cheap touch that only served as warning of the pretentious ways of this establishment.


Our appetizers were beef carpaccio, foie gras, and the bone marrow, which was the main reason for us going to JG instead of Mastro's. The foie gras was burned and insipid - without a doubt the worst tasting foie gras I have had. The carpaccio was a better appetizer but the amount of meat was below what other restaurants offer at similar price and quality of dish. My wife liked the bone marrow; since it is not something I enjoy much I will not comment on its taste.


We were debating whether to leave and go to another restaurant because at this point our expectations for our entr√©e, a tomahawk, were very low. Turns out we were right. The tomahawk completed the disappointment. We decided to pack the rest of the entr√©e and move our dinner to Mastro's, which has become a must visit every time we are in Vegas.


Btw, when I made the reservation, I told the hostess that our visit was to celebrate my wife's birthdate. The check came and went without any mention of the special occasion. 


We walked over to Mastro's and had the escargot followed by the tomahawk, which was about $10 less than at JG. We also had the lobster mash potatoesNo comparison between the two restaurants. Service, comfortable seats, white new-like table cloth, beautiful decoration, and much better tasting food. We were able to compare the two tomahawks side by side. If Mastro's was a 10, JG's was a 7 at most.


When we walked in, we were asked if we were celebrating anything, I told them about the birthday occasion. After we were done with our entr√©e and without further direction, our waiter placed Mastro's signature dessert, the butter cake, with a happy birthday dedication on the plate - there was no charge for the butter cake.


We regretted ever setting foot on JG but were happy that we left to still enjoy dinner somewhere else. 


This review is not to recommend Mastro's, but to warn you about JG. There are restaurants that are worth spending $100 + per person where you will feel satisfied after your meal. JG is not one of them. 


I am in no way affiliated with Mastro's or any other establishment in Las Vegas.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"An acquired taste, but I recommend that you try it at least once in your life.  We dined like celebs to wagyu beef and steaks.",Good,,
We went here for my 30th birthday dinner and really enjoyed ourselves.  The service is excellent and the food was good as well.  Sides are ordered separately but are large enough for at least two people to share. The drinks we ordered were delicious as well and there are a lot of options for mixed drinks and wine.  If you're in Vegas and enjoy fine dining you should go.,Good,Good,Good
"Steaks were cooked as we requested, service was average, lighting decor too dark.  For the price there are other choices.",Good,Bad,
"I visited here on July 25th before the gold nightclub. I had the 36oz porterhouse medium well, cooked to perfection! They give you the typical bread with four different steak sauces. I also had a side of fries and a beer. I would recommend this place for meat lovers like myself! Also service is excellent.",Good,Good,Good
"Ate at this steakhouse the first night I was in vegas. They had an early dining special for $69/person and included a salad, entree, and dessert. I had the Caesar salad, filet, and chocolate cake. The steak was excellent. Boris, one of our servers, was great to talk to about Las Vegas history and famous eateries around town. Would definitely recommend.",Good,Good,Good
"Me and my wife were planning on going sirio restaurant but it was closed. So we walked to Jean George's steak house instead. And I was amazed how tasty my 8oz filet mignon was. Cook in a wood burning stove. It was like a crispy duck around the edges and so red and tender in the middle. And the mash was delicious too. My wife had the chicken and loved it.  150 dollars but worth it. Been craving it since we returned home. Mmmm
M.....",Good,,
"Jean Georges empire rarely disappoints.  Service was great! Steak delicious, sides of Creamed corm and lobster mash were rich and luxurious. The show stopper is Dessert corn souffle with caramel corn. suggested by the bartender, and a must!!!!!",Good,Good,Good
"So I love meat and have eaten at some of the finest steak houses in the US; this IS NOT one of them. Maybe they were having an off night but the steak was average at best. I had the 10oz Aspen Ridge Filet and it was lacking in flavor and was as dry as a Grandpa's scalp! My son had 12oz NY strip and he said it too lacked flavor. Not what you expect when you're ordering $55-$65 steaks. That said, my wife had the Spring Pea Soup and the Dungeness Crab Cake (two appetizers rather than an entr√©e) and she said both were delicious. I tried the soup and I agree. Bottom-line, there are much better places to get a steak in Vegas, pass on Jean Georges.",Bad,Bad,
"Great restaurant with knowledgeable staff and great food/service.The meal will not disappoint.A tad procey,but you will remember a great meal so splurge!",Good,Good,Good
"Ribeye bone in was cooked perfectly and was delicious. My friend had the special Wagyu steak ($105) with the distinctively large bone. He said it was the best steak he ever had, and the most expensive steak he ever had.  The sides were each very good. We had reservations and were promptly seated on a Saturday night. The food came within 25 minutes of ordering. We had very Good although one of the servers seemed a bit pushy with asking us to order more wine. Very expensive place (probably some cheaper steakhouses out there of the same quality) but our party of 8 had a good time. Dark ambience.",Good,Good,Good
"I ate here on a Thursday night with 2 of my friends. We decided to do the food tasting experience with a wine pairing. It was on the pricey side as it was $164/person....but it ended up being so worth it.


I almost felt like I was on this really cool adventure and everytime a new dish was presented, our taste buds were in for a treat. The short ribs were the best I've ever had. The steak was amazing.


I would recommend this experience to everyone!!",Good,Good,
"The food itself was definitely of good quality, but it certainly wasn't the best steak I've had. This was all the more surprising, since the chef-owner of the restaurant has served me the best steak I've had at a different restaurant. Jean Georges happens to helm PRIME at Bellagio, which continues to be the best steak I've had in Vegas. Knowing this, I felt like a namesake restaurant wouldn't disappoint me, and for the most part, this was true. Jean Georges Steakhouse is set far from the casino floor on the mezzanine level of Aria. It's an odd walk to get there, but I can see the benefit of being set away from the casino. Honestly though, the restaurant itself could probably use a boost from the energy and liveliness of a casino floor. On the night my friends and I had gone, it was dark and dead. I'm not the type to complain about the dimness of a restaurant, but Jean George manages to take it to cave-like levels in an effort to seem hip and cool. The space itself is expansive, but it can definitely make it seem like no one else is there which can make for an awkward dining experience. The saving grace of the restaurant space lay in the Good and service.",Good,,Good
"Surprised at other reviews because this was literally the best steak my (new) wife and I have ever eaten. Only gravity was required to aid the knife in cutting the steaks. The sides were amazing also. Creamed corn was unreal! 
Yes it was the most expensive meal I've ever had ($250) but it was worth it! 
The waitress was more than helpful when serving us if we had a question and deserved a good tip for being so attentive and was so pleased when I asked her to thank the chef for a wonderful meal. 
Highly recommend!",Good,Good,Good
"So dissapointed in this place. I have been looking forward to dining here for the last month! Jean George, please take note of the following: if you have a couple there for dinner at 5pm on a tuesday and asks u for a quiet table, dont seat them between 2 tables of 6. The proximity to those large parties was too much and all 3 tables had the same waiter, so lets just say we were neglected for most of our meal. I ordered the dry aged streak and my hubby had the rib eye, both were decent, but nothing to write home about. Overall, after a 1h dinner where we had: shrimp cocktail, 1steak and 1 side each, we walked away with a $200 bill. There are so many steakhouses in Vegas, try this one if no other places in City Center are available. Also had to send back a drink, because it wasnt strained or done right.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Located at the Aria hotel this restaurant has a great atmosphere along with great service. I asked for the wine list which is presented via an iPad. The sub $100 wines from Bordeaux are the Chateau D'arsac, and a Margeaux. I researched both as I sat at my table. Both had very disappointing reviews, and both could be purchased at the sub $30 mark. There are far more reasonably priced clarets which would have gone down far better that the crappy wine selection on offer. Above $100 and you were looking at Petrus, the worlds finest wine at 14-17 k per bottle. Shame that the person who chooses wine for this restaurant purchased the wine on a label value rather than having any clue about wine!  
The food -
The wagyu steak was amazing, however the b√©arnaise was overpowered with vinegar. It is a difficult sauce to make however some practice is advised. 
Again in the food department the ingredients speak for themselves however delivery lacking.",Bad,Good,Good
"We were in Vegas this past weekend and we decided to go for a nice steak dinner on Friday night. Reservations weren't that difficult to come by; we made one for 2ppl at 7:30pm that morning. 


Ambiance:
The restaurant is very dark with a romantic/trendy vibe. Crowd was well dressed, sophisticated. 


Noise Level:
Medium. The bar area was loud because of a group of ppl, but the restaurant area is nice and quiet (not too quiet) where you can have a conversation with the ppl you're with without needing to raise your voice. 


Food: 
- Seafood platter: pretty standard; oysters and clams were fresh, king crab and lobster portions were plenty and delicious. 


- Caesar Salad: this salad was a little bit of a let down. For $16 it felt like a rip off and looked like it came from one of those pre-made salad bags you buy at the grocery store. 


- Porterhouse: we shared the porterhouse (I added the seared foie on top; which was SO GOOD). The meat was perfectly cooked and definitely the star of the night. I loved the sauces that came with it (Salsa verde, bernaise, spicy mexican cheese (i think?) and a jam-type of sweet sauce). SO SO GOOD!


- Wine: Duckhorn Cabernet Sauvignon paired perfectly with the meat! 


In total the meal came out to about $450 for two ppl w/ tax and tip. Overall, this was one of the best steak meals I've had in a long time. I can't wait to go back!!!",Good,Good,
"The steaks that are on special are very pricey, but I ate every dollar of it up!  There is no words for the quality that we encountered.  So Tasty.  We ate there 2 times because of how awesome it was.",Good,,
"Just got back for a Vegas run, and had to warn all of this nightmare of a steakhouse. Lets start from the beginning. We were seated right away at 7:15pm not many people there,""Should have been our first warning sign. So we order drinks, they say full bar but no blended drinks, hello that means limited bar by definition. We order my drink was $20 blue and 99% alcohol and 1% juice, simply burned just trying to drink, told waiter and asked for a simple Mai Tai, right?? It comes 30 mins later , same thing undrinkable! We order our food, now we have a new waiter??? Don;t know why, We order shrimp cocktail, ceasar  salad, and we were to share tomahawk ribeye. Rememeber we got seated at 7:15, Appetizer and salad come at same time? Salad is mushy and smells VERY fishy ,gross. Cocktail has 3 reg sized shrimp on a plate nothing fancy just 3 shrimp and 2 sauce on a plate, actually looks like it had been pick from in back before delivered to our table, then 1.45 hrs later Our $105 steak shows up it is now 9:10pm and our show is at 9:30. they split the steak in the back, we literally only had 4 edible bites each from this mess. the rest was grissle and fat. Unbelievble. Thanked our new waiter for super slow service and abad steak and he said let me bring you a dessert to make it write as he drops the @$250 + check on my table, don't forget I had nothing to drink the whole 2+ hours casue I couldn't get him to return the undrinkable 2 drink. Paid the bill left the dessert and told the floor manager the whole experience was a joke, he just smiled and said have a nice evening. WOW Bad, Bad AND BAD MANAGMENT. SHAME ON ARIA FOR LETTING SUCH A LOW STANDARD OPERATION IN THEIR HOTEL!! I not only won't be back to this terrible resteraunt, but not back to Aria either! Be warned DON'T RISK YOUR MONEY! Read my other reviews I try to be blunt and honest. Read my G ramsey review, I was right it is closed now!!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I cannot recommend the tasting menu and wine pairing enough.  Perfect amount of food with the most unexpected, delightful flavors.  Our new favorite restaurant in Vegas.",Good,Good,
"A friend and I both enjoyed our dinner at Jean Georges. Our servers were attentive and personable, and very helpful in our selection of dishes. The meal itself was superb. Get the side dishes of peas as well as mashed potatoes with truffles-- wow! The restaurant is pricey, but worth the splurge for a memorable meal. You're in Vegas; live it up!",Good,Good,Good
"On this recent trip to Las Vegas we were fortunate to have enjoyed a wonderful dinner at the Jean Georges Steakhouse on Wednesday July 16, 2014.


We made a dining room reservation a few days in advance and were served by Jom and John, both gentlemen were professional, knowledgeable and light hearted, they added greatly to the enjoyment of the evening and Jom's guidance through the menu and his suggestions for food, cocktails and wine choices made for a great experience on our inaugural visit.


We highly recommend ordering the ""Aviation"" from their cocktail list, as a pre-dinner libation and also really enjoyed the Crispy Sushi Sampler and the Burrata Mozzarella as appetizers.


For dinner I ordered the JG Cheeseburger (Truffle Mayonnaise, Brie Cheese and 
Yuzu Pickles, accompanied by Truffle Fries)...don't judge the burger choice, until you've tried it, it was DELICIOUS and cooked to perfection!


My spouse enjoyed the 8oz filet cooked to a perfect rare+ and complimented by grilled asparagus and roasted trumpet mushrooms...the steak was so incredibly tender and flavourful.


For dessert, we were surprised with a delectable warm, moist, chocolate lava cake, served with vanilla ice cream on a plate with a hand written ""Happy 17th Anniversary"" wish. A lovely touch!


This restaurant offers outstanding food and skilled table service in great surrounding that can be enjoyed by all...when in Vegas...EAT HERE!",Good,Good,Good
"Good, variety and holey crap was it expensive.  The steaks are done to perfection, but at that price they should basically cut themselves and then feed you.",Good,,
"Beautiful setting, inside the Aria hotel. Impeccable service. Fantastic ribeye and lobster mashed potatoes. Excellent cheese cake",Good,Good,Good
"We were very impressed with the food here, however our experience was spoilt by the service which didn't meet the same standards. 
Waiting times for getting any kind of attention from the serving staff was too long. We waited 15 minutes just to be seated even though we'd made a reservation, without being offered a drink at the bar. I don't think having to ask twice for a second glass of wine and wait 10 minutes with no drink at all, or asking different staff repeatedly for a bill because we had a show to go to, and still waiting another 10 minutes in a restaurant of this price range is acceptable. 
A real shame, as my steak was the best I've ever had!",Good,Bad,Bad
"The prices can be a bit shocking, but once you taste the food you will understand the price. I was here for a business dinner and the atmosphere was absolutely perfect. Our waiter was very helpful and he never let our wine glasses get to empty. I ordered the slow cooked salmon and it melted in my mouth.


I definitely recommend this establishment if you are looking to spoil yourself a bit.",Good,Good,Good
We enjoyed an elegant and magnificent meal on Thanksgiving Day at Jean Georges.  We also had the pleasure of celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary that evening.  This was the perfect restaurant for such a special celebration with our family.  Exquisite service!,Good,Good,Good
"This place was expensive but the chicken was amazing!! The service was great! The dinners do not come with sides, fries are $12 the strip is $54",Good,,Good
"Ate here with a colleague of mine during a business trip and I thought that once we walked in we would be waiting for a while to be seated however to my surprise we got seated rather quickly. We decided to get a bottle of wine which paired nicely with our meal. For an appetizer we got day barbecue baby back ribs which were excellent! For the meal I got the 12 ounce New York strip and my colleague got the porterhouse as for the sides we were told they were big enough for two people however they were not that large. we got the cream corn and garlic mashed potatoes which were very very good just not large enough to be satisfied. The staff were very friendly however seemed a bit disorganized. In all we had a bottle wine, appetizer two beers two steaks two side dishes at a cost of around $370 which included tip which I guess isn't horrible but thankfully this was a business trip because I would never pay that out of my own pocket for a meal no matter how good it was but I'm a little cheap. Also if eating later say after 6 or 7 you should think about make a reservation.",Good,,Good
"I had their burger, it was fantastic! Started with calamari and wedge salad both were fresh and tasty. The service was prompt and attentive. This place is pricey, but hey your in Vegas d this is a really nice spot. I'd go back again",Good,Good,Good
"You really can't go wrong here if you are willing to shell out the bucks that eating here requires. It is a very good restaurant and the service was outstanding.  I realize that expensive restaurants seem to pride themselves on ""presentation"" which always comes at the expense of portion size.  Having said that, I believe the portions were quite small even by white table cloth standards.


Great atmosphere.",,Good,Good
"The food was excellent, but the service was a little sub par for the price. They were sweet though and made a dessert for us to celebrate our upcoming nuptials.",Good,,Bad
"By far, one of the best meals I have ever eaten in my life!!! Aria City Center is gorgeous and we will definitely be back again soon! I have been to Vegas about 7 times now and this was one of the best trips yet. We went with some friends for Christmas. The decorations at all the hotels were to die for, but my favorite was the big reindeer inside ARIA.",Good,Good,
A group of 6 of us got into this restaurant for a most wonderful meal and wine.  Service was perfect - classy yet not pretentious.  The staff worked together well to make sure you were happy and pleased.  My boyfriend had one cut of steak and I had another.  Both great.  Loved their version of a Caesar salad.  Wine list was good and priced fair.  Would definitely go back to this restaurant.,Good,Good,Good
"The food is very tasty! Appetizers, main course... We had no room for dessert so can't comment on those. I just love the variety of sauces that came with my steak as it truly helped bring out different flavors in my steak.


Staff very professional and helpful. and thank you for making my steak as ordered! Love that.


I love technology but it was truly difficult dealing with the beverage/wine list on the iPad. There was so much choices that we spent a good 15 mins just reviewing, filtering and trying to narrow the selections. I maybe old school but prefer a regular wine list. 


I would visit again.",Good,Good,Good
Had dinner here on our first night in vegas as it was in our hotel(the fabulous Aria) everything that we ate was so nice even the breads. Would highly recommend. Our server who's name I can't remember (she had blonde hair) was really informative and recommended some great dishes.,Good,Good,Good
"Had a great experience. My Caesar salad was ok, but everything else was top tier (endive salad, short rib, lobster tail, sides, dessert). Pretty good wine list with wide variety. Expensive, but you get what you pay for.
Would go back for sure!",Good,Good,
"Everything was very delicious and perfectly served. Not so refined as in NY. The thing that I didn't like there was a dozen of bad mannered, noisy people in shorts and shabby clothing sitting behind us. With regret, I must admit the lack of class in Las Vegas Jean Georges",Good,Bad,Good
"We had dinner as a party of six in April 2014.  I had high hopes but was very disappointed in the restaurant considering the cost.  The food was okay, but not outstanding.  We started with the wedge salad, which was decent, but oddly spicy, with whole strips of bacon on top.  I had a wagyu filet.  The style of cooking wasn't to our taste.  Though it was the appropriate doneness inside (medium-rare), the steaks were quite charred on the outside.  


The steaks are served with various sauces, which was cute, but I wasn't impressed with any of them.  The sides are sized for one to two people.  These were the highlight.  We had the black truffle mac and cheese (excellent), mushrooms (good), and lobster mashed potatoes (very good).  After reviewing the dessert menu, nothing looked appealing, so we ended the evening there.  


Service was also okay, nothing special.  With so many other choices in Las Vegas, I cannot recommend this restaurant.",Bad,Bad,Good
We booked one of the private rooms for a corporate function with 25 people.  The entire experience was fantastic!  Recommended by my good friend Johnny Florentino and this place did not dissapoint.  Wow.,,Good,
"Not sure where JODI11963 from NYC went to but our experience at Jean George in the Aria Resort and Casino was nothing short of a memorable meal with great company.  The service wasn't outlandish but our waiter was well mannered, amicable and well versed on the menu's particularities.  The Pinot Noir he helped us to select was a hit - wonderful bouquet and pleasant on the palate.  The tuna tartar was a fantastic starter.  The Wagyu beef was outstanding and melted in our mouths.  The accompanying asparagus was not overcooked and flavorful.  The apple pie a la mode was scrumptious and a perfect choice for the end of our great meal experience.  I would highly recommend this restaurant without hesitation.",Good,Good,Good
"Not impressed by Jean Georges Steakhouse.  We live in NYC so we visit all of Jean Georges restaurants frequently.  The service was not great, we had to pour our own wine and water.  The food was definitely no where near what any of Jean Georges restaurants serve in NYC.  The shrimp cocktail were rubbery and the burrata was awful the Tuna Tartare was really so so and quite small.  The only thing worth the money here was the steak.  Not even the sides could rescue the meal. It's unfortunate, this is why Great restaurateurs should not be in the chain expanding business.  Never works !!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Thoroughly enjoyed the six-course tasting menu.  High quality food, presented perfectly, with a great assortment of both surf, turf and veggies.",Good,Good,
"Went to this restaurant twice on our most recent trip to Vegas. The first night we went the food and service were excellent.
We decided to go there again on our last night.
What a disappointment in both the food and the service.
My wife and I both ordered the lamb. Mine was acceptable but unfortunately my wife's was way overdone. We eventually tracked down our server and sent it back. 
While we waited our sides got cold and we had to insist they bring new ones.
Finally the meal came and the meat was such poor quality that it was inedible.
They did take that meal off the bill but that was not the point.
We were prepared to pay for a great meal and service.
Not the memory we hoped for on our last night.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"My friend and I went to Jean Georges Steakhouse at Aria and sat at the bar hoping to watch the NCAA Men's basketball championship game and grab a bite to eat before hitting the casino.  He recommended the JG Cheeseburger and I'm glad he did.  I'm not usually a big fan of fancy burgers with high price tags, but this was the best.  The bun and burger were perfectly paired and was served with Truffle mayonnaise, Brie cheese, Yuzu pickles and Truffle fries.  Indescribably delicious!  Somewhat pricey at $26, but definitely worth the price, try it and you won't regret it.",Good,,
"Regardless of whether you are at the bar or in the restaurant, the customer service is incredible at this restaurant.  The food is outstanding, even the popcorn that is served as the snack in the bar is incredible. Our group had a large assortment of items on the menu and no one was disappointed. The sommelier was incredible and suggested wonderful wines ( i wish I had gotten her name, she's truly fantastic) I highly recommend Jean Georges'.",Good,Good,Good
"Incredible Ribs, Crab cakes, etc. etc. You Cannot go wrong here!! Aria Hotel and Casino location. Will Definitely be back!!!",Good,Good,
"We went to Jean Georges despite some of the bad reviews we read. We figured that some people are picky and perhaps the reviews were a little harsh. Not so. 


The decor is cool. When we got there we had to wait in the lounge... On a very comfy couch. Unfortunately, that was the highlight of the evening. 


Right from the get-go, it was a bit of a let down. Our waiter's accent was very hard to understand and he seemed disinterested in our visit to the restaurant. There was NO idle chit chat... He didn't ask us what we were doing, where we were from, if we were celebrating anything....But in fairness, maybe they aren't supposed to? 


The wine and cocktail list was handed to us on an iPad, which was cool... I ordered a wine and hubby ordered a rye. The rye cost $26. One ounce. Ridiculous. 


We knew the prices were high, and we were good with that. I appreciate that a great steak in a fantastic restaurant is more pricey. Having said that, we are from Alberta, and have the pleasure of eating some of the best beef in the world on a regular basis (imho) in extraordinary, high class restaurants. 


The 6 oz filet mignon was $56... And was just Ok. It was cooked perfect, but the crab meat (I ordered oscar) was very dry. I expected it to knock my socks off for the price we paid. 


Presentation was mediocre, and the sides we ordered (saut√©ed spinach, grilled asparagus and Mac n cheese) were overcooked (almost burnt)... Although the asparagus and Mac n cheese had good flavour. 


The food aside, when you go to a fancy, high class restaurant, you expect phenomenal service. The service was pathetic, at best. Every one of the wait staff that came to our table were cold... Almost like they weren't supposed to be friendly or something. It was quite weird. I've been to some restaurants where the food isn't that good, but it was still a great experience because the wait staff made it enjoyable. We ordered one drink, ate our very expensive meal and left. Had the waiter been interested in us at all, I may have ordered dessert, being as we were there to celebrate my 40th birthday. 


Jean Georges missed the mark for us. There are much better Steakhouses in Vegas. This is just my opinion, you may have a better experience!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This was by far the best meal we had in vegas. The selection of cuts was fantastic. Perfectly cooked. The sides and the salads were fantastic. They also feature one of the best hot sauces I have ever tried, made in house too. The cocktails were fantastic as well. Highly recommend.",Good,,
Drinks at bar prior to dinner with great recommendations for bartender. Food and service was excellent from start to finish.  A little on the higher end of the price scale but truly a exceptional meal.,Good,,Good
"OK, you need to know this is not going to be a cheap dinner. But, sometimes, you just have to spurge. My steak was a sago carnet, and it was flawless. Save space the the most unusual souffl√© on earth, one with carmel popcorn on the top!",Good,,
"We debated on going here or Prime at Bellagio, out of convince went here. Big mistake. Had the tasting menu. Food was really good but the service took a nose dive halfway through. Was basically abandoned when we were served the main course. For this money I would expect better service. Will not go again and would advise everyone else go elsewhere.",Good,Bad,Bad
We made reservations in advance and I recommend that.  The steak was perfect!   The meal was delicious! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Hope to make it back sometime later this year!,Good,Good,
"We had dinner here before the circus show and I have to really say this was very bad. We were 4 people, only had the main dish and a bottle of 60 USD wine and paid 325 USD for it. Apsolutely nothing special, the cezar salad is joke, and all together overpriced and not good. One of the worst steak places in vegas.",Bad,Bad,
"We went to Aria to see a Cirque show. The reservations were nice to have, but the restaraunt wasn't crowded during the week at that time. We had a lovely meal. All the food was delicious. They ever rushed our dessert out so could make the show on time. I would recommend this place if your in the area.",Good,Good,
"Vegas restaurants can be expensive, this I know, but when you think you are dining at a place where a world renowned chef is actually cooking your meal, then it's worth it. Not at Jean Georges though. At $55 for a NY Strip steak (plus the additional sides) I expected it to melt in my mouth. It tasted like it was from the Outback Steakhouse....lacked flavor and was fatty! They give you a sauce with it that also lacked flavor. One of the people in our party ordered the salmon, which she had to send back 3 times before they finally took it off the bill. It was the most pathetic piece of salmon I have ever seen. Wimpy, thin, and looked like it was poached. Bleh! Service was very sub par. Our server had the personality of a doorknob and didn't seem interested in us at all. My husband and my bill was $240.00...we would have had better luck putting that money down on a roulette table downstairs!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had made our reservations prior to our Trip to Las Vegas.  Jean George's was in our hotel, and their valentines tasting menu looked amazing.  We were promptly seated for our 8pm reservations.  Lovely  decor.   They were bustling due to the holiday which was understandable.   We received our first course prior to drinks- which again I was understanding about.   First course was the onion soup and it was amazing.  Some time passed and we recieved the second course which was shrimp and it was also good.  And we waited.... And waited..... And waited.   It is now 930.  Our waiter said our steak would be out soon- but unfortunately at this point I was no longer hungry.  Another 10 minutes when the steak arrived.  First time in my 37 years I have ever asked to speak to a manager.  I was friendly, just wanted him to know my disappointment.  I had been looking forward to this dinner for weeks, and didn't even get to sample the steak.  He was friendly if a bit detached, and the ended up comping my meal/ which I felt was fair.  My husband said that the main course was good, if not somewhat undercooked, ( ordered medium and it certainly was medium rare). He devoured the dessert, a cherry like tart and ice cream, which I tasted and it was good.   I'm basing my low review on the overall disappointing valentine's experience.  Not so much on the food which would of been well received with more timely service.",Bad,Bad,Bad
I am form NYC so I am very use to great service and the big steakhouse selections but JG at Aria is second to none... The room is amazing... the service is spot on and the Food is out of this world. I hate to say it but the sauces blow your mind on top of some of the best prime steak I could imagine. Great Wine List on an Ipad too.. Vegas is always stepping up its game.,Good,Good,Good
The food was very good.  I was especially fond of the appetizers.  My steak was under cooked but they remedied that quickly. Wine prices are high.  not very many bottles under $100.,Good,,
"Jean-Georges Steakhouse at Aria. I had an ‚ÄúOrange Elderflower‚Äù cocktail (don‚Äôt remember if I liked it or not), iceberg lettuce with blue cheese and bacon for salad,  6oz Wagyu Filet with Black Truffle mashed potatoes followed by coffee $133.50 not including tip. The service was informal, but pleasant, the food was tasty, but not over the top great as it should have been for the price.  The ambiance was more like a warehouse than a restaurant.  Not impressed, but no complaints either.  Solid three and a half stars. Really expected more, live and learn.",Bad,Bad,
"The food is 10/10 but note to hostess, when a couple come in don't seat them between a table of businessmen, tables are extremely tight, we had business deals taking place on both sides of us, I couldn't even hear the waiter and told him why, but didn' t even move us, not impressed eat at Siro's or American Fish much nicer ambiance and clued in Staff...will I return...NO",Good,Bad,Bad
"There are so many restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas, but we chose Jean Georges because we were in the mood for a steak and they had a Prix fixe menu of 3 courses for early birds for $69.00 (and not that early) We are used to the sensible portions that they serve in Europe, so were glad we were not stuffed after a salad, 8 oz. steak, and cheesesteak.With a bottle of wine, it was perfect and a memorable evening!",Good,Good,
We made reservations and everyone one enjoyed their meal. The atmosphere is lovely . The steaks were large and we all shared the cream spinach and the crusted pepper baked potatoes  are  a real treat. The roasted Brussels sprouts were fabulous.  We will go back when we go back to Las Vegas.,Good,Good,
"We live in Las Vegas and enjoy going to different restaurants on The Strip for  special occasions or just because!  We decided to try Jean Georges Steakhouse at the Aria Hotel the other evening - just because! 
When we made our dinner reservations, we had requested a booth, but when we saw they weren't separate booths, we asked for a table and our hostess was able to accommodate us.  Our waiter, Brandon, was very professional and attentive, and we appreciated his menu suggestions.  After a glass of Cabernet for my husband and champagne for me, we started with the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp but felt the bacon flavor was rather overwhelming when paired with the shrimp.  For our entrees, my husband had the Australian Wagyu strip steak and I had the USDA strip steak which were accompanied by several delicious dipping sauces.  I enjoyed my steak and after tasting his, was glad that I ordered the U.S. beef.  The wagyu tasted too cured to me so if you like that,  it is a good choice.  Our side was the roasted brussels sprouts with avocado and pecans and it was outstanding.  We usually share dessert and were going to order the Honey Crisp Apple Pie with Bourbon Ice Cream as my husband isn't a chocoholic like I am.  Then Brandon mentioned that Jean Georges was the originator of the Warm Chocolate Cake so I couldn't resist and I ordered that and he had the apple pie which he enjoyed.  I'm so glad I got the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream as it was luscious and honestly, I have my chocolate fix for the week!  The restaurant was rather noisy, but that is pretty typical for a Strip venue.  I think the tasting menu would be an interesting choice - maybe next time!",Good,,Good
"A very nice atmosphere, as is most of the dining in the Aria hotel, but that is where the good qualities end. For the price, the portions are small. I should not pay $90 for a meal (for 2 people, with tip) and leave the restaurant hungry. The salmon was good, but nothing noteworthy. It was small and served over a paultry amount of mashed potatoes and had some green garnish on top - no side dishes included. Since the steak prices are ridiculous, my fiance got a burger, which was greasier than something you could buy at Burger King, and was also small. And don't expect to get free refills on your drink - my fiance got a Coke for $4.50, and got a refill not knowing that it would cost another $4.50. In a restaurant that charges this much, I expect a fountain drink to have free refills. To add to this insult, our waiter was condescending, the food took entirely too long (we had gotten there just as it opened and there was one couple finishing their entree - we waited at least 30 minutes for our food). This was my worst Vegas experience by far. Skip this and go to the buffet where you can have prime rib and crab legs until your stomach explodes - and as much soda as you want too!",Bad,Good,Bad
"not  that good.  Pricey place, great atmosphere, great service.  A group of 8 visited Jean George's, all guys.  The sides here are all served family style so the is plenty to share and an opportunity to try several.  We ordered the creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, black truffle Mac and cheese and the roasted Brussels sprouts.  All were good but my favorites were the spinach and sprouts.  I ordered the 18 ounce ribeye medium rare.  Nice steak but nothing exceptional.  Others ordered steak, sea bass and lobster.  The steak guys agreed it was good but nothing exceptional.  The sea bass guy really liked the sea bass but I am skeptical of his opinion as he had had consumed a fair amount of intoxicants that day so his palate may have been a bit affected by his alcohol consumtion.  The lobster guy, who was not impaired, really liked his meal.  Over all it was an enjoyable experience but I have had better for the money.",Good,Good,Good
"The meal was amazing, I found the server pretentious.  
he was a bit older, and just seemed to want to run the show rather than ask us how we would like our experience to go, not sure if that is nit picky, but I ended up feeling more like a child who was being told what to do then an active participant...
I got the salmon, it was lovely, I stole some of the bernaise sauce from my bf's steak sauce collection.  I loved the chopped brusslesprouts they did on top.  We got the lobster mashed potatoes, it was fine, although I bet the regular ones would have been just as good, nothing to rave home about.  The asperagus was done perfectly and the bf was very happy with his steak.


We were in a bit of a hurry, to leave for a plane, but our server didn't seem overly concerned or helpful in that department.  Someone who was not our server (a woman) ended up doing the bulk of addressing our concerns.  We were in early, 5pm, so it wasn't a slam issue.  Also the extra waiters, bread deliverers etc were much more pleasant to be around and made us feel welcomed.  Btw the bread was awesome! make sure you come with some time to spend so you can eat all the things.


The calamari was actually to die for, light, and so delicious, probably one of the best I've ever had, and I love to eat calamari...",Good,,Bad
"Steak frites here are pretty good, apps are fantastic. Very expensive. Two bottles of wine $180 each. three apps, three steaks and three cocktails, no desert. $1000.00 not including tip",Good,,
"We enjoy eating in fine restaurants, and fine restaurants are abundant in Las Vegas.  Choosing is so hard.  Jean Georges exceeded all expectations.  The service was impeccable.  The atmosphere was relaxed and cool.  The food was superb.  I will return.",Good,Good,Good
"This is an expensive place, even for LV. You would expect table cloths, not placemats. You would expect stellar steaks, not just okay steaks. The bar did serve a great house Manhattan. The wine pour was small/average compared to other restaurants. Nothing really stood out for all the hype.",Bad,,
"Tried this restaurant after hearing good things.  It was okay.  The food was good, but I do not think it matched the prices we were charged.  Good to try once.",Bad,,
"We made a reservations for 4 adults and 1 baby. My daughter was 7 months old at the time. When we got there, they told us they didn't allow anyone under 5. Huh? I would understand if it was an adult only restaurant (if so they should have told us when we made the reservation) but no one under 5???? My daughter at 7 months old was way way quieter than many 6, 7 years old! What a strange policy! I never went back even without my daughter and won't.",,Bad,Bad
"In December 2013 I came for drinks with a colleague. Back in July 2013 and January 2013 I had full-on dinner with appetizers, mains, desserts and wines with a gal pal and guy friend, respectively. 


I adore the decor and atmosphere. This probably my favorite restaurant in Vegas right now. 


Only one complaint about December (versus July & January) is that they didn't have foie gras! But the bartender was so cool, he came back a few minutes later and told us that the place next door did have foie gras if we wanted some that evening.",Good,Good,Good
"With a zillion steakhouses in Vegas, all very good, why choose Jean Georges? Because it is Jean Georges. 


You walk into the restaurant into the intimate round bar with rather strange side seating. Grab a seat at the bar and have celebrity bartender Aaron serve you a signature martini or in my case, a nice pour of single malt. Wines by the bottle can be found on their iPad or better yet, ask the Sommelier for a recommendation. 


The dining areas are split into two: The main dining room and the offshoot. If you have must come with kids (which are only allowed on holidays), take the offshoot. Otherwise, request the main room. The environment is calm, relaxing and features multi-tiered seating. 


The menu is typical steakhouse with a wide assortment of different grades and cuts of meat. We opted to share the brussel sprout side as a starter and it was amazing. For dinner, we had the T-bone done perfectly and sea bass, specialty of the house. And you must get their french fries, they are so good. Service is efficient with three people taking care of us and food arrived in perfect harmony. 


Located in Aria Promenade level. Certainly not to be missed if staying at Aria.",Good,Good,Good
"Amazing atmosphere. Amazing food. The only thing about this restaurant is that it is quite understaffed, and we waited quite a while for both our server to serve us and for our food to arrive. One waiter, along with his partner, served close to 10 tables, so he was hustling around quite a bit. The food made up for it, though. The lamb is perfection, and is a must-try!",Good,Good,Bad
"We went here on a business trip, we had a group of about 20 people, and we were treated like royalty.  They provided us the boardroom in the back and made sure our every need was handled, they made great recommendations for wine.  I got the 8 oz filet mignon with a side of asparagus, both cooked perfectly, I also tried the brussel sprouts and mac and cheese, both were extremely good as well.  I rate it a little lower because of the price point, it is extremely expensive but I would absolutely go again.",Good,Good,Good
"The food here is beyond incredible.


We started with king prawns wrapped in bacon and a mountain of seafood - oysters, crab legs, lobster tail, prawns and all sorts!


For the mains we all had filet mignon steaks - cooked medium rare. It was cooked to perfection!! Around the table we shared a variety of sides, from brussels sprouts, truffle mash, fries, creamed spinach and mac n cheese. It was truly incredible.


Service was fab - wine selection was fab - I would love to come back!!!!!",Good,Good,Good
Went there with friends with low expectations and we found out to be one great option to taste great steak and drinks. It's a little bit pricy but it's worth it.,Good,Good,
"Jean Georges does indeed offer fantastic steaks. Two in my group ordered the 8 oz filet mignon and the third ordered a 12oz NY strip. The steaks, which were cooked to our exact instructions, came with 5 different dipping sauces - a nice touch. 


We paid $120 per person for one beer, one salad, one side of potato and the main dish. No dessert. Things can get expensive in a hurry if you opt for the kobe beef, 6 oz at $275.


We dined there on Thanksgiving evening. Most of the restaurants that remained opened for the holidays were fully booked. Jean Georges was at about 50% capacity - not surprising since the menu is pricy. I mean, $14 for a baked potato??",Good,Good,
"Definitely one of the best steaks I've ever had, but I was shocked at the price. I get it, it's Vegas on the strip, so what can you expect? The service was impeccable, the atmosphere lovely. No complaints really.",Good,Good,Good
The Coby steaks were great!  Service and atmosphere were also excellent.  This was our second visit to Jean Georges Steakhouse in one year.,Good,Good,Good
Ate at Jean Georges November 19th. I dined with three colleagues. I found the prices to be very high but thought the food was very good until I got sick about 5 hours later. My colleagues all had the filet and I had the Chilean Sea Bass. I was so sick that I ended up in an urgent care to receive IV fluids to combat dehydration. I am just starting to feel better 5 days later. The rest of my Vegas stay was ruined. I have never been that sick in my entire life.,Bad,Bad,
"We have been to our fair share of Vegas Steakhouses and this one stands out in my book! The ambience is perfect, service us fantastic and the food, superb!  I will say that my  Bone Marrow side dish was my absolute favorite thing we ate here!!!! I love bone marrow and this is the best I've had! Our steak was soooo tender, I don't even remember using a knife.  We will be back!",Good,Good,Good
"Great ambience!  Excellent Food!


Located in Aria, this is a beautiful setting. Restaurant was very busy but the service was great!


Went with a group of 11 so we got to hear the reviews of many types of meals - not a bad review was heard!   If you have a big appetite, try the Tomahawk steak!


Jean George is also the head Chef at 'Prime' in Belagio and personally I prefer Prime but don't have a real reason  - just personal preference. Don't think that Prime is quite as expensive but both are great restaurants.",Good,Good,Good
"I love Jean Georges!  This is one of our favorite Steakhouses in Vegas.  It's chic, the service is outstanding, and the food is awesome.  When we lived in Vegas, we dined here several times with friends, clients, and associates.  Since we moved away, we've dined here a couple of times and it's still one of the best.  On our most recent visit, we ordered:",Good,Good,Good
"We went to Vegas to celebrate my brother's birthday and went to Jean Georges for his big night.  Executive Chef Rob made a personal visit to the table and spoke to our group of 6 pre-dinner and got us fired up for what was being prepared for us.   We enjoyed an experience second to none with a huge selection of house specialties.  Our server took great care of our group and the food was outstanding. Kudos to Executive Chef Moore, it was a night to remember.  Will be back to visit any trip back to Vegas..well worth it!",Good,Good,Good
"My husband and I ate here last Friday night. We were staying at the Aria for our wedding on Saturday night and wanted to make sure that the entire weekend was top-notch. Jean George Steakhouse came recommended as one of the best dining experiences at our hotel.


Our concierge made reservations for us at nine and we were seated after a very short wait. It looks small from the entrance, but don't be deceived, this restaurant is huge! The decor was generally very posh, but as you enter the restaurant, you walk past a circular bar. 


The bar is gorgeous ( a cool black lace type of pattern), but the effect is ruined by the TV's behind the bar. Although upscale, there is no sort of dress code and there were many people at the bar in jeans and scruffy tee-shirts. Although I generally dress this way, it was a bit of a let-down to see it at such a nice restaurant, especially on a Friday night.


The waitstaff was generally very friendly and personable. We joked around with them and it gave the place a but of a casual air. It was comfortable. They were also very professional and attentive, with our course coming out at a good pace and our drinks always full. It felt like we had a team of servers, as we interacted with many different people. 


We went with the five course tasting menu with wine pairing. Each course was beautifully and artistically arranged. I wanted to take pictures, but it just didn't seem appropriate! It was often too pretty to eat! 


The first course was Caviar served in a lemon and on a bed of a lemon jelly. It was delicious. The second course was tomato based. I can't remember exactly what was on it, but it was very good. The third was scallops- my favorite course! I can't recall the fourth course, but the final was an amazing cut of steak. We added the truffle mashed potatoes, which are a must-do! For dessert, we had a chocolate mouse. Everything was outstanding.


A piece of advice- If you do the wine pairing (and you should) skip having a pre-dinner drink. I actually got fairly drunk and couldn't finish or properly enjoy my meal. It's a big undertaking, go in on an empty stomach!


Also, be prepared to spend more on pictures. They had a photographer going around to the tables and our pictures were so good, that we bought all of them. We spent about 150.00 on the pictures alone. They were great though!


Jean George Steakhouse is a decadent meal. The food is upscale, but the vibe is relaxed. I'm glad that we went here, but it isn't a good pick for a ""romantic"" restaurant, which is what I was hoping for on my wedding weekend. It's loud and busting. Fun and vibrant. But alas, not romantic!


Like my review? Visit my blog!",Good,Good,Good
"High price, high quality. HOWEVER, I don't like it when the wait staff is pushy about getting more drinks! We were half way through our $40 cocktails when they were asking us (something like 3 or 4 times) if we wanted ""refills"" or if we were ready for a bottle of wine. 


Let it rest, Dude! I'll let you KNOW when I'm ready!!",Good,,Bad
"Wine list was extensive. The wait staff was superb. Two bus staff as well as two waiter staff took very good care of us. Yes, the price was high but for the quality, but for service and ambiance it was well worth the experience. their is not a bad steak in the house,, but i love that tomahawk as well as the t-bone.dont let this one past you by in vegas at the Aria hotel ..ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW A HUNDRED TIMES..",Good,Good,Good
"My wife and I stayed at Aria from October 13th through the 17th. We had dinner with friends on Tuesday, October 15th. We entered the restaurant and were greeted by a well dressed and eloquent staff. We were escorted to our table and promptly seated. The wait staff was superb. Two bus staff as well as two wit staff were responsible for our culinary needs. They worked transparently never interfering with conversation or menu choices. The water glasses were filled as necessary. The drink order was taken, professionally, and deliver innocuously. I ordered the oyster appetizer and it was beautifully prepared, chilled with three sauces on the side. The oysters were as fresh as possible. Everyone at the table could not stop remarking about the ambiance, wait staff perfect service, etc. My Filet Mignon was delivered at perfect temperature with nicely presented side dishes. The bus staff as well as the wait staff worked hard to make sure our food, drinks were perfectly served. Yes, the price was high but for the quality, service and ambiance it was well worth the experience.",Good,Good,Good
"I really wanted to like the Jean George Steakhouse at the Aria, but my experience just didn't justify the price.   I opted for the 16 oz Dry-aged Rib-eye, and at $66, I think it was a bit of a let down.   Steaks at JGS are served with a couple of interesting sauces, but I'm also of the opinion that you should not rely on sauces to enjoy your fine steak....the steak should have enough flavor to go solo.   Despite my feelings, I did tend to favor the 'homemade hot sauce' over the other three.   The sauces were good, but it just didn't seem right.


The sides were actually pretty great---we had servings of the beef bone marrow, black truffle mac and cheese,  and grilled asparagus....all were quite remarkable.


Regrettably, the chilled seafood platter was kind of disappointing.   I think we were hoping more for the tower experience that you'd find at other steakhouses.   It just really felt uninspired....smallish oysters on the half shell, normal sized servings of other crustaceans....just really wasn't all that impressive.


I think really what I found most disappointing was the lack of a good waiter....we had a large party of 10 guys at a table, and our waiter seemed completely uninterested and unmotivated.   Our waiter wouldn't make recommendations, didn't engage us in the menu, didn't come back to check on us during the meal....really kind of distant and we had to get his attention a number of times.   Maybe other waitstaff at this restaurant would have been more attentive, but I think we were unlucky.  


So bottom line---the food was average, the service was disappointing, and at that price ($150 with one cocktail, steak, appetizer, sides, added gratuity), I most likely would not return.


Maybe you will have better luck?",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Interesting decor.  Those are supposedly renderings of cow noses on the walls.  Well, that's unique.  As for the food, the steak was well prepared.  The sides were delicious, particularly the Brussels sprouts.  Wine list was extensive.  Our sommelier was a pleasant woman who was very helpful and unpretentious.  The food here, in my opinion, while quite good, is not any better than other steakhouses where I have dined.  The prices are extraordinarily high.  $16 for a side of vegetables, that's crazy.  So expect a large tab at this establishment.",Good,Good,Good
"Atmosphere is very cozy , and service was excellent . The steaks were cooked to perfection, the tuna tar tar was oh so delicious . This is fine dining so expect to pay . My  6 oz filet was 56.00 . I would eat here again .",Good,Good,Good
"Ate at Jean Georges while staying at Aria for a conference.  Given the name I had high expectations, but they were tempered a bit based on some of the reviews on TA.  The interior was cool/modern and the place was quite busy/loud.  The wine list is on an ipad and thank goodness they had a wine expert on staff to help us navigate it.  Most of us at the table ordered the 8 oz filet, which looked very simple but was truly delicious (so good that I can't wait to come back).  The sides were also excellent/creative but a bit on the small side.  The service was fairly attentive given how crowded it was.  Definitely on the expensive side, but I would eat there again in a heartbeat.",Good,Good,Good
"This was our second time dining here.  The food was excellent. My husband and I both had steak and they were cooked to perfection.  With your steak they serve you four samplings of their home made steak sauces.  Awesome!!  The sides come in small crocks that are sharing portions.  This time we had garlic mashed potatoes and creamed corn, both were delicious!  Our server, Juan, was very helpful when we had questions and very attentive to our needs.  Our only issue we had on this evening was the loud techno music playing throughout the restaurant. It just didn't seem to fit the dining experience.",Good,Bad,Good
"Just had dinner here over the weekend and it was fabulous.  Most of the people at my table had steak, of course, and every one of them just raved about how perfect each steak was prepared.  I, however, ordered the lobster which was special that night, and it did not disappoint. It was cooked perfectly.   All of the sides:  asparagus, mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, and truffle mac and cheese, were outstanding.  The cocktails were very interesting and truly tasty.  You need to come here with a lot of moolah in your wallet, but if you're going to splurge on a great steak in Vegas, this is the place.  Service was impeccable and the atmosphere here is very nice.  My husband liked it so much he went twice.  Once for business and then once for pleasure.  I would love to go back.",Good,Good,Good
"After waiting almost 30 minutes for our first drink and over an hour for our meal with really no attention from the staff, we actually found the food to be amazing. My wife and I both had the Wagyu Filets and I don't think I'll ever be the same. It was literally the most delicious steak I've ever tasted. Ever. The sides were tasty but meager and the bread basket had some delicious baked goods but if it weren't for that steak, this place would get 2 stars. Of course it's extremely expensive for the lack of service and I'd only go back if I had $200 in food credits from Aria.",Good,,Bad
"My husband and I bought a dinner and a show package. We chose the steak dinner at Jean Georges before our Zarkana show. We were excited to try this reataurant.  As soon as our waiter saw we had the dinner and a show combo his entire attitude changed and was rude and short with us, he handed us our menu and suggested we order sides from the regular menu because the menu from the combo ticket had no sides included. My husband and I were not too hungry so we told him the limited menu was fine, our server immediately turned around and walked away, as we walked away my husband said thank you to the server and the server did not bother to turn around and ackowledge us but we said ""You're Welcome"" with his back turned at us while still walking away. Of course this set the tone for our dinner and had it not been for my husbad wanting to give the waiter a chance I would have walked out of the restaurant. Then we were ignored for about 10 minutes, we were brought water but no bread. The waiter came and asked if we wanted wine, we told him no thanks, he then seemed upset again as if throwing a hissy fit and walked away again. We were drinking water as we both felt dehydrated and planned on drinking alcohol later in the night and neither of us drink soda so we concluded our server was upset we only asked for water and no sides. We finally were brought bread by a food runner. Then we were brought our steaks, My husband ordered a medium rare fillet mignon and I ordered the same steak but well done, both steaks were crispy and burnt on the outside now mine I can understand since I forgot to ask for it to be butterfly'd but my husbands? My husband ate his steak but he only ate the middle since that part was not burnt and crispy. As you can imagine I was ready to again just walk out but again my husband wanted to make the best of it. The server never came by again only the busser and the food runner, they were actually nice and pleasant. BTW there were only 3 tables filled in the room including ours.  When I left I asked for the manager and I gave him my complaint he asked me a few questions but also seemed indifferent. We were treated like scum from the moment our server saw our combo ticket for dinner and a show. Do not choose this place with your package, it was the worst steak and worst service and very uncomfortable to see a waiter throw hissy fits and attitudes. My husband decided to tip the server against my wishes but had the server treated us better we would have tipped generously. If this restaurant treats people like this they should not participate in the 
dinner and a show package.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Went for a steak dinner with my girlfriend on the evening of her birthday. I recommend a calamari starter followed by a ribeye steak. We had a complimentary desert because of the birthday which was super. Cocktails are recommended pre dinner.,Good,Good,
"This is not really a ""steak house.""  If you are expecting one you will be disappointed.  On the other hand, it is a wonderful restaurant that does steak, among many other options, extremely well.


We did the signature tasting menu.  They were extremely accommodating of my dietary needs (no meat, fowl, shell fish - vegetarian with fish. The other people ordered the regular tasting menu.


Wonderful and inventive menu. Each dish was done well.  The test of a great restaurant is how they hand mistakes (which always occur) The one time a dish had a problem it was taken away, a new one cooked immediately and brought out in almost no time. The corrected dish was excellent.


Those who had the Wagyu Filet Mignon were really wowed by the dish.  


Finally, they went above and beyond in service.  When I did not see a particular type of wine on the menu, the person in charge of wines remembered that a new shipment had just arrived and she remembered seeing the wine there.  She went down and brought up a bottle.  Excellent.",Good,Good,Good
"Came in for a quick late dinner while staying at the Aria. Great food, my partner had the whole wood grilled snapper and I had the chilean sea bass, shared the salt and pepper baked potato, nice wine. 


Service was good, nothing to write home about though. Saw staff standing around talking a lot which was  Quite unprofessional. 


Decor was gorgeous",Good,Good,Good
"It wasn't that the food was bad, although I literally couldn't eat the truffle Mac and cheese, but for a restaurant that offers you a $285 6 oz fillet - I was disappointed to say the least.  The were multiple service related issues that spanned across several of the staff so I couldn't quite feel that it was isolated.  I will probably not return because there are so many other options in the same neighborhood.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Just a great steakhouse that is a culinary master piece.  Very favorable and comfortable in a dining sense. We chose the signature tasting menu which include Chilean Sea Bass and Wagyu Filet Mignon.......can I say more.  A must try,Good,Good,
Extremely expensive steakhouse but It was a great meal. The restaurant is dark and  pleasant to look at. The service was great.,Good,Good,Good
Don't waste your time at this extremely expensive steakhouse.  Went for a 4-day getaway and made this one of my stops at the Aria Hotel in Las Vegas.  The steaks were terrible for both myself and a friend.  I've had better steaks at Outback.,Bad,Bad,
"We were excited to try for RW, and I have to admit that our meal was amazing. Getting our correct menus, our proper orders, the limes we asked for, and the right glass of wine was another story. Also, even with reservations, we were seated right by the service station, meaning we got to see how they delivered wrong entries to wrong tables several times! The service became so comical, it was like a three ring circus of error after error. The manager even came by and gave us his apologies and card for next time. We laughed it off...and there won't be a next time!",Good,Bad,Bad
We visited here for a formal meal and the service was superb. The food was excellent and the drinks were incredible.,Good,,Good
"Was here on 08/23 for a group dinner (4 of us). We decided to go with the Restaurant Week menu - NY Strip. Service started okay, but was non-existent after they took our order and brought our wine. Glasses were never refilled, nobody was asked how the meal was. The food itself was really the worst of the disappointments. Chewy, gristly steak. For a big name like JG - you'd expect way more. And to top it off, they tried to slip an extra bottle of wine onto our bill. Nice! Rarely am disappointed by the higher end steakhouses in Vegas - but this one was thumbs way down.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"My husband and I were in Las Vegas to celebrate our Anniversary.  We decidied to try Jean Georges Steakhouse at Aria.  It was a great meal.
To begin with, the restaurant is dark and very pleasant to look at.  The service was great. For starters, I ordered the wedge salad.  It was not very good in my opinion.  I barely touched it.  My husband had the crab cake-it was outstanding.  For my main entr√©e,  I ordered the Rib-Eye and was very very happy.  It was tender and very yummy.  The Sides were great too-creamed corn and hand cut fries.  The server was efficient and very knowledgeable.  He wished us a Happy Anniversary and brought us a complimentary chocolate cake with ice cream.  This dessert was so good-it may be the best dessert I have had. 


In summary, I enjoyed my entr√©e but will not order the salad again.  I would definitely visit this steakhouse again.",Good,Good,Good
"Food was great.  Best steak I had in a long time!
Service was excellent!  Very friendly as well.
Not cheap by any stretch, but well worth the splurge!",Good,,Good
"This place got the most important thing right, our steaks were superb, and the starters and desserts were decent too.


However, the service was bonkers! Every time we took a mouthful of water, someone would rush over to top up the glass. At one point, we decided not to drink any water for a while just to see what happened. A member of staff appeared and topped up. We deliberately didn't drink any more and when another memeber of staff appeared a couple of minutes later and grabbed our water bottle, my guest pointed out that we wouldn't be able to lift the glasses without spilling if she put any more in!


That was odd, but what really annoied me was being upsold the way you might expect in a fast food joint. When I ordered steak, I was asked if I wanted to add a lobster tail for 'just $65.' When my guest mentioned that he liked one of the sauces, the waitress began a long spiel about how the recipe was in Jean George's book and asked if we'd like to buy a copy!


We had a good laugh about it afterwards, but this $150 per head restaurant hasn't got an ounce of class!",Good,,Bad
"I ate here July 20th. Before zarkana. The wine menu is an iPad I thought that was cool. Ambiance of this place is nice. The staff are prompt. They start you off with some bread its good. I ordered the 36 oz porterhouse medium well. It was cook to perfection just the way I requested. Didn't get sides, figured the meat was plenty. I ate the whole thing. For my birthday they brought me molten chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream. A nice touch. Happy birthday spelled out in chocolate syrup on the plate. Worth the price I'd go back for sure.",Good,Good,Good
"My buddy and I decided to go for a nice meal on final night - went for in Aria choice. 


Turned out to be great great choice. Wasn't full of Ramsay reality TV watchers lining up to ""do that and buy the t shirt"".


Service was brilliant.  Atmosphere was fantastic. Cool bar to start with a cocktail then a quiet table with personal, friendly and professional service. iPad wine list was cool too.


Shrimp cocktail was awesome start loved the second sauce- steak was perfect - 4 sauces accompanied. I loved them all


Also lobster mashed potato and cream corn were superb


This will become a standard for my annual trip - really was a very pleasant surprise.",Good,Good,Good
"I loved the rib-eye steak but the sauces didn't impress me. Service was good, so was the wine. I wished the desert (chocolate fondant with ice cream) had been served with a ganache.",Good,,Good
The whole meal was wonderful and our steaks were the best we each had ever had (and we've had them all over the world!). Service level from the greeters to the server to the support staff was top-notch. Only modification I'd suggest is a little more light. Might be the darkest restaurant I've ever eaten in. But strongly recommend anyone looking for a world-class steak and dining experience to eat here.,Good,Bad,Good
"There were 7 of us and we had a wonderful time. The steak was perfect, a Wagu NY strip nicely charred on the outside and moist and red on the inside. Service was attentive and timely and we had a leisurely dinner never feeling rushed. Prices are high, but this is the""New"" Vegas and very upscale. For an important business dinner, or extra special occasions I highly recommend it.",Good,Good,Good
We had a great dinner here. Nice atmosphere away from the gambling hall. Attentive service. This place can stand its ground against the best steakhouses of NYC. Flavorfull steak and the most tender filet mignon you can find. All cook exactly to your liking. The only downside is that I found the wine list by the glass somewhat disappointing and very expensive (even for Vegas restaurant standards). Recommended.,,Good,Good
"If you're eating here then do yourself a favour and order the wagyu filet mignon, it is beautifully tender and melts in your mouth. My wife ordered the filet and I ordered the ny strip and was completely jealous of her order. Fantastic venue with very attentive staff - thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience here.",Good,Good,Good
"The sad thing is, you can no longer get steak this good in Australian restaurants, since we export it all to places like this.


The 'special' of the day was an Australian grass fed rib eye on the bone from Rangers Valley.  A $90 steak that was about the size of something you might see on the Flintstones.   Served with truffle fries and a choice of condiments, or as I had, hot English mustard, on request.


It has been so long since I have had steak this good, I had almost forgotten how really good a great steak can be.


What I would have loved to have done is washed it down with a cracking Barossa Shiraz.  Something like and E&E, St Henri or St Hallet would have been great.  But alas, the wine list was deficient in this area.


I told the sommelier what I was after, and he recommended some US Shiraz as being close to it.  But it wasn't.  Lots of cherry and no vanilla at all.  Drinkable, but not a great match for the fantastically good steak. 


Service, atmosphere, everything else was great.  I will be going back to this place on my next trip to Vegas for sure.",Good,Good,Good
"Best steak house in Vegas. (I also ate at Ramsays in Paris).
The service at Jean-George's was first class, the waiter was knowledgeable, friendly, attentive and everything else we wanted him to be. He explained every dish completely, he spent time going over the specials and suggested that we didnt even need a whole portion of fries or other side dishes each. My wife had a 10oz Lobser tail from the specials and I had a Rib-eye steak. Both meals were by far the best we had tasted for a long long time. The atmosphere and decor were both spot on - I would thoroughly recommend this restaurant.",Good,Good,Good
"Honestly, I have no words to describe that steak. Best steak ever, hands down. Almost a religious experience. ""Soy-garlic marinated"", it's not much bigger than a tennis ball, and costs something like U$ 65. Worths every cent. Next day, I couldn't help coming back for more. Oh, yeah, the restaurant? Nice, expensive.... OK.",Good,Good,
"Another fantastic dining experience. This place really knows how to do it right. Excellent wine selection and service. The steaks and side dishes were cooked perfectly. Usually we would never put anything on a nice Filet Mignon. However, the Filet was served with 4 sauces on the side. They were all fun and fabulous. The soy/miso sauce surprised us both. That turned out to be our favorite. The staff consistently provides excellent customer service. We will definitely return on our next trip to Vegas. 
*This resturant is steps away from the new Cirque du Soleil, Zarkana show. Great spot to hit, before the show. I would plan at least an hour and a half dining time, at Jean George before the show, to reduce the need to rush.",Good,Good,Good
"We went at Jean georges for our 1st anniversary on Saturday evening after the show... This is the 3rd time we go to the Jean Georges and we have never been disapointed! This is still a mysterious question for me: ""where do they buy their meat?!""... The ribeye is so tender, so juicy, so tasty! I have been disapointed by the french fries this time... They advertise hand cut, but this is clearly not hand cut... Or hand cut from the freezer. And the price is in the high range for a steakhouse... I would rate 3.5 stars if I could... I recommend anyway this restaurant for a good intimate and romantic dinner.",Good,Good,
"While staying at the Aria for a conference over the past five days, we decided to sample one of Las Vegas' numerous steakhouses. Not having a lot of time, we decided to try the early evening special at Jean Georges on the premises. We enjoyed a nice 8 ounce steak, a salad and dessert for about $70 apiece.  Not exactly inexpensive but not expensive either - by Vegas standards. The steak was delicious - prime cut if not large - and the the meal was nicely presented. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. The premises were also quite pleasant - dark and intimate.",Good,Good,Good
"Upon entering the restaurant, we were asked if we had a reservation (answer was no). We were told to have a seat and he would check to see if a table was available. No sooner did we sit down when we were informed a table was ready. Entering the dining area we saw that it was only 10% full!  When presented with menu's we were asked if we wanted an appetizer. I asked about the shrimp cocktail- menu outside restaurant said it was $18- menu inside said it was $24.  I enquired about the difference and was told the menu inside was correct. I declined ordering because of this discrepancy saying they should honour the list price as advertised.  Server returned shortly and  said they would accept the listed price of $18- Ordered the shrimp cocktail- It arrived- 4 shrimp!
Dinner orders were steak with baked potato and scallops. Both meals were fine, but not warranting the price you have to pay,
Service was adequate but we never felt as if we were really welcomed- staff just going about their jobs.
We travel to Vegas frequently and for price paid & service received would not recommend, nor return when their are so many other fine restaurants,",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Even though is a Steak House not only the Steak is good also the fish is great, great selection of wines, great service, great decor, great atmosphere",Good,Good,Good
"We were a group of 5 celebrating 2 birthdays and it was a great night!
The filet mignon was out of this world,the scallops fantastic,the lobster delicious,mac and cheese decadent. It was a sunday night so quieter than usual but great service and a nice relaxing atmosphere. The non smoking rule at The Aria and The Vdara really enhances your experience at all their restaurants and clubs and this wa no different. A beautiful restaurant,fantastic food ,I will be returning.",Good,Good,Good
"Ok, so I'm not a big steak lover..But LOVE seafood. Accompanied husband to dinner/ meeting. Had a wonderful time even if it was work. The Seafood Platter was out of this world. It's a shared appetizer that was ordered for 8. The king crab legs were as long as my lower arms. The Prawns were almost the size of my hands. I don't understand how a restaurant in the Middle of the desert can have such fresh seafood? Anyways, we only finished 60% of the platter. If I would have known that, I probably would have not ordered the Salmon dinner. Which, was also out of this world. I think I ate the entire dish..Everybody at table was satisfied with dinner...",Good,Good,
Steaks starting at around 60 dollars.  Overpriced truffle fries 14 dollars.  Really dark interior. No atmosphere.  Bit of a conveyor belt attitude and nothing to make it feel special.  Tables a bit too close for comfort.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"I entertained 13 guests at Jean George, the staff was very accommodating for our large group and we were given a private ""chefs table room"".  Food was outstanding many had the filet & Lobster, Rack of Lamb was excellent and I can attest to the herb crusted whole roasted Red Snapper.  Very extensive wine list with an equally impressive dessert menu.  My group all raved at how good there meals were.  Wait staff was very helpful and all meals came out together and cooked to order.  If your looking for a memorable evening you must consider Jean George.",Good,Good,Good
"We booked this place before looking at some of the Trip Advisor reviews and I'm glad we did because if we had done it the other way around, we probably wouldn't have gone.  Maybe we were lucky but we certainly didn't experience any of the problems that some previous reviewers have. 


The restaurant was quite busy when we arrived, but we served pretty quickly and the staff in the main were polite and helpful.  I say in the main because one female server didn't seem to understand the basics of silver service and general manners.  She interrupted, reached across both me and my husband, crashed things down on the table and was generally gauche in her manner.  It didn't ruin the evening but it did detract from the general feel of the place and let the other great staff down.  


Both my husband and I had steak and they were both good.  Not the best I've had, but pretty good.  The sides were excellent (carbs, carbs and more carbs!) and it was all very well presented.  Normally I do not eat dessert but when I saw Salted Caramel on the menu my resolve weakened, and boy am I glad that it did.  It was amazing!  


The prices are standard for a Vegas steakhouse in a five star hotel, not cheap, but hey, it's Vegas!  


I would recommend Jean Georges, as apart from a stroppy waitress, it was all very good and I pretty much crawled away - the sign of overindulgence!",Good,Good,Bad
"We arrived late, unaware of a 10:30 close, we were actually 10:35 at the door. We were generously seated anyway. The bacon wrapped shrimp was very good. I had the lamb and it practically melted in my mouth. A bit pricey, but definitely worth the splurge. The staff was great, and I loved the modern, chill atmosphere. I will go back.",Good,Good,Good
"We always stay at the ARIA each and every trip to Vegas, so we have endeavored to try each and every restaurant at the property.  Jean Georges is very good.  Had a filet, creamed spinach, etc. - all the trimmings.  Not the best steakhouse I've ever been to, but very good none the less.  I especially like the different sauces that come with the steak - a nice touch!",Good,Good,
"My partner is a big steak fan so i thought i'd treat him to a meal here, even though i dislike steak. There is a very big sliding scale of prices for the steak,going right up to several hundred dollars. My partner had the wagyu beef which was about $75 and it was served with a selection of sauces. He was so happy with it and when i had a try i had to admit it was delicious! Having had a buffet for lunch i wasn't particularly hungry so just had a starter of bacon wrapped shrimp (which were amazing!) and a side of truffle mac and cheese (also yummy).


The service from the waiters were delicious, they were able to talk us through the menu and make suggestions, the ambiance is lovely, it was a perfect meal.


The one thing that stopped me giving a 5 star review is the photographer that they have going to tables taking pictures. She brought us the results which were quite nice, we were interested because being just the two of us away we didn't have any great pictures of us. However when we asked the price we were told $95! It seemed obscene so we asked if there were any different options, she seemed intent on quite a hard sell and when we decided to buy one of the photos for $20 which was the cheapest option she seemed to sell it to us resentfully. It just kind of spoilt the moment.",Good,Good,Good
The filet is wonderful.  The menu is unique and everything we tried was delicious.  The service is top notch as is the atmosphere.,Good,Good,Good
"Mmmmmm. My husband, who loves steak. Loves GOOD steak. States this is the BEST steak that he's ever had. All the sides and salads were delicious. I had the chicken and it was scrumptious.",Good,,
"Beautifully decorated restaurant.nicer than the pictures look. Large restaurant however the layout doesn't make it feel too big. 


We arrived at 730 for a booking we had made. We were not seated until 745 for no apparent reason. Table was available and restaurant was less than half full. We then waited another 5 minutes before we were given menus.


Menu is nice with good selection. Specials are offered at table although make sure you check the price. A crust on the steak cost an additional $20.


We ordered cocktails which were beautiful. My husband had the bacon wrapped scrimp. Really tasty and would recommend. The bread brought to the table is warm and a great and slightly different variety to normal. We both had steaks for main course with baked potato and sauted spinach. Really good. A selection of sauces are brought to the table so no need to pick up front. Overall food was delicious. 


So why only average? It came down to service and atmosphere. The restaurant had a large corporate function on. Most of the staff felt distracted as they prepared for the function. Much more attention on setting up than on looking after the customers they had seated. Also the guests for the function were ushered through to the restaurant and they were served wine when standing. This lead to groups gathering in the aisles. One group stood right at the back of my table and proceeded to sit on the back of seat I was sitting in. The seat was a high leather runner which ran along many tables so not quite as bad as it sounds however it did distract from dinner and did prevent me sitting back in the seat. The staff should have seated the group or found a more appropriate place for them to stand.",Good,Good,Bad
"I enjoyed dinner here, and liked the way they seasoned and prepared their steaks. The service was a little too leisurely and I was ready to go by the time dinner was over. The space is beautiful.",Good,Good,Bad
"We stayed in the Sky Suites and made a reservation at Jean George's through the concierge. We get to the restaurant about 20 minutes before our reservation and both the hostess and the manager made a HUGE fuss about us having our daughter with us. Apparently, the restaurant has a no child rule. You would think the concierge would have informed us of that.


The manager begrudgingly let her stay, and the hostess pulled me aside to say: ""If she acts up, we're going to have to ask you to leave.""


I was shocked. The restaurant was empty because it was early, save for a bachelorette party causing WAAAAY more of a disruption than my daughter ever could. I felt like saying : ""If she does anything, pretend that she's drunk"". 


The food was okay, nothing to write home about. Too many other options in Vegas to bother with this one.",Good,Bad,Bad
"In common with some other premium steakhouses on the Las Vegas strip, Jean Georges' has some indivbidual meat selections that will comfortably get into three figure sums.


While the quality of the steak is very good, I found the quality of the service to be a little cool and off-handed.


As is so often the way in the large Vegas resorts, the signage directing you to this restaurant is lacking ... you might save yourself some time and some wrong turns by asking staff for directions from time-to-time. You can't help thinking that some of these resorts want you to get lost because you'll pass more retail opportunities!


At first sight, the dessert menu looked interesting, with some obvious favourites such as creme brulee available. However, at second sight, it became clear that all the dessert chocies had been unnecessarily fiddled with to justify the price. Unfortunately, none of the embellishents sounded good  - sometimes (especially with desserts such as creme brulee) less is more. Just stick to the original dish, the way most people expect it to be.


A very good restaurant, no doubt about it - but it could be rated excellent if the service was a little warmer.",Good,,Bad
"When we read that a restaurant touts a ""fine dining"" experience, we have certain expectations.  It doesn't mean just white linen tablecloths and expensive but fabulous food, but rather the ambiance should also be conducive to a refined dining experience.  We have travelled the world and eaten in all sorts of restaurants so we are not nit picky to say the least.  We walked in with reservations for 6:30 pm on a Wednesday night.  The Bangles were blasting through the overhead speakers.  We thought it may have just been at the front of the house, so we followed the host to our seats.  We sat down, ordered a bottle of still water and perused the menus.  We could not hear anything the waiter said, nor could we even yell at each other to be heard.  We asked the waiter to speak with a manager to turn down what had now turned into some heavier rock music.  We were told it was not possible as it was controlled somewhere else.  Now I love rock and roll any day of the week, but in this particular case, not so much.   I wanted ambiance, quiet and relaxation to enjoy my very expensive meal.. Unfortunately, the noise was just so loud and abrasive, we had to get up and walk out.  We went downstairs to Javiers.  I have another review on that as well.",,Bad,
"This was the best dining experience we had in Las Vegas.  The decor and atmosphere was serene and interesting.  The service was impeccable. And the food.....The Caesar salad was unexpected, crisp and full of flavor. The filets were so delicious and cooked exactly as requested. There was a choice of 4 sauces served with the dinner, and all 4 were tasty, with the butter based the most complementary.  Even the asparagus was simply wonderful! Where desserts are usually just good, the apple pie and ice cream was outstanding, though the creme brulee was just good. I highly recommend eating at this dining jewel!",Good,Good,Good
"Had dinner with a large group here recently and it was phenomenal.   Everything you expect from a top Vegas restaurant.  Steak was cooked to perfection and the sides were delicious.   Very nice atmosphere also.  Reservations highly recommended.   Our group was over 15, but they have some nice intimate tables as well for couples.",Good,Good,
"We split a tomahawk rib-eye steak, it was very good, and equal in quality to the other great steak houses in Vegas.  What I really liked were the sauces served with the steak and the fried calamari. The wine list is good, but at usual Vegas pricing.  Service was adequate, we waited to get our check and finally signaled another person.  We will probably choose Prime next time, also run by Jean Georges, due to the menu and the music.  Younger people will probably enjoy Jean George more than we did.",Good,,Good
"I have eaten in a just about all his restraunts in NYC and was very excited to eat here. JG restaurants always deliver. The Ceasar salad was so good, to this day my wife still talks about it. I had the Filet Mignon which was like butter. The atmosphere & design was very nice done. After you have a great meal you just head out to the amazing Aria or just hit the stripe. I would defiantly go back.",Good,Good,
"I had dinner here before the early show of Zarkana.  At $69, the early menu was reasonable and allowed me to be out in about an hour.  The service was quick, attentive and well paced.  I had the Caesar salad, filet mignon, and the warm chocolate cake for dessert.  The Caesar salad was huge and had chili peppers on it which made for a unique taste.  The steak was cooked perfectly, juicy, and came with several sauces you could put on it to enhance the flavor.  The dessert was wonderful.  At the end of the meal, I was sated but not stuffed.  Just the way a meal should be.


The entrees on the early dinner menu don't come with sides, so if you want them you will pay extra.  I didn't order extra sides and was fine, but some people may not want to eat a steak by itself.  Other than the restaurant being a little dark for me, I enjoyed my meal. 


Anytime you eat at a celebrity restaurant, you can expect to pay more because it is supposed to be a fine dining experience.  I have found that the pre-theatre menus allow you to sample the offerings without breaking the bank.  Sometimes you want something of higher quality than the regular buffet or chain restaurant.  This is it!",Good,Good,Good
"This steakhouse earns it's high prices for their specially aged steaks.  If you can afford it, go.  I also loved the asparagus but the mushrooms tasted weird to me.  Wine list was great.",Good,,
Food was good but value was not.  You can do better around town for the money.  Was not terrible but dinner for four people with drinks was very expensive.,Bad,,
"Went to JG on Saturday night with a group of 5.  We were all fairly full from all day March Madness activities and a happy hour, so the whole meal consisted of 2 rounds of drinks and an entree for 3 of us, with the other two sharing the tasting menu.  No apps, one side, and 1 dessert.  Bill was 500.   My guess would be a full meal with a drink would run you about 150-200 a head if you're getting decent things but avoiding the ever-present ""insanely overpriced treats"" that all LV steakhouses have listed in a few places.  Drinks were well made and the drink menu on tablet was a neat touch.  Steaks were delicious.  I had a Wagyu filet that was cooked perfectly.  Dessert was actually the one standout of the night with some salted caramel ice cream, caramel corn, etc.  The tasting menu pair were really only blown away by the steak entree and fish course.  The app left something to be desired.  Overall, I felt that it was a bit below my expectations for the price.  I didn't have that wow factor that I need from a restaurant in this price range.  It's a very good restaurant, but I've never felt that lukewarm at a Joel R. Altier in MGM or somewhere like Citronelle Michel Richard in DC or similar place in NY.  Let's face it, in Las Vegas today, if you want to go have a 300+ dinner for a couple, you've got a lot of choices. This wouldn't be on my short list next time.",Good,Bad,
"The hostess at the front was very friendly....and that is where it ended.  The server was arrogant, and only pointed out the most expensive steaks on the menu.  You could see his dissapointment when my boyfriend ordered a beer and myself a sprite (no big alcohol tab here). Even with no appetizers, and small steaks each, our bill was $250!!!  The steaks were cooked to perfection, but the taste was flat (even with the green stuff they serve with it, which the waiter was clearly not interested in explaining what it was). The side dishes (mac and cheese for $18...Asparagus for $14) were hardly worth the money.  A total dissapointment to say the least.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"the room is nice, the service friendly but the food is below my expectations
considering GJ is a famous chef and restaurateur running restaurants from Mexico to China I was expecting much better
there is a strange feeling that your waiter is trying to sell the most expensive stuff on the list , rather than recommend 
the food was competently made and good but the room was infested with a strange odor that I can't identify if it was a meat odor or from different foods
anyway was unpleasant and unacceptable
considering this is a famous chef and it's an expensive place I don't recommend a visit",Bad,Bad,Good
"Our dinner experience here was very nice.  Have read some of the other reviews that were bad and think they could not have possibly eaten at the same restaurant. Our servers were very typical of upscale restaurants--they stayed out of site but were somehow right there when you needed them. We both has steaks that were cooked perfectly.  The truffle mac-n-cheese side dish was amazing, as were the truffle mashed potatoes.  We also had calamari as an appetizer, and the sauce that came with it was so good I practically wanted to eat it with a spoon. The meal  for two of us and drinks (several mixed drinks each) came to somewhere around $350 plus tip.  This is about what we were expecting at a restaurant like this.",Good,Good,Good
I dined at Jean Georges with a group of friends.  The menu had great choices specializing in steaks of course but had excellent choices if you preferred sea food.  My steak was excellent and prepared just as ordered.  The sides were a nice mix and there was something for everyone.  The wine list was quite good as well.  Our service was above average but the restaurant was bustling on a Wednesday night.  The service was good but not very personal for the price range of this restaurant.  The restaurant is very contemporary and hip in decor.  All is all a very Good.,Good,Good,Good

"I came here with 2 of my friends and husband while visiting Las Vegas. My meal was honestly some of the best risotto I had ever had. My waiter had recommended it to me when I mentioned being a vegitarian (the only one of my group). Being a non meat eater in a steak house can make one feel like a fish out of water. My server instantly asked me if I liked mushroom risotto as an option (not listed on the menu). 


Now what made this review good instead of great was 1. My husbands hambuger was not very good according to him (he is also not too picky on things). Once our server found this out he advised he would remove that entree from the meal. My friend has also ordered a filet and found it to be quite undercooked towards the end. In the end our server made this dinner stand out not so much the food.",,,Good
Enjoyed one of the best steaks I have eat at Jean Georges Steakhouse at Aria.  Perfectly seared and cooked to just the right temperature.  Outstanding!  Appetizers and side dishes all were delicious.,Good,Good,
Very poor service; food is very average; highly overrated steakhouse-worst I've been to in all of Las Vegas; buyer beware!,Bad,Bad,Bad
"Ok, so it was better than it sounds, but seriously???? This is supposed to be fancy restaurant.  Other than that, since I've been here before, I can say that this place has great food.  Stick to the steaks and the burgers and you should be fine.",Good,,
"My wife and I recently went to the Aria and for our last night decided to splurge with dinner and a show.  We opted for the Zarkana dinner package, which included two tickets to the Zarkana show and the restaurant of our choice.  We selected Jean Georges Steakhouse.   Total price was $400 which included show tickets, dinner, tax, gratuity, but a limited choice of two appetizers, 8 oz. filet and two desserts. 


After being seated and given menus (and the drink menu on a ipad) we informed the waiter that we were part of the dinner/show package.  He took our menus and replaced them with smaller show menus, that listed what our options were.  He then gave me back the full menu and said that there are no side dishes with the package, so we'll need to pick from the menu.  I felt that his whole attitude changed when he found out we were with a special package.  The tip was included so maybe ""why work hard"" for this party.  Too bad, we are big tippers for great service regardless of whether it is included or not.


The wines by the glass list was quite short.  I think maybe 6 red wines to choose from along with 3 sparkling and about 6 white.  I expected more selection and not $22 a glass. 


When it came time to order, the waiter took the entire order, appetizer, how we wanted the filets cooked and our dessert.  Do you ever order your dessert at the time you order your dinner at a high end restaurant?  I know we could only pick from two options, but maybe we could have ordered those after we finished the meal?  Tacky!  Disappointing.


My wife had the balsamic tomato mozzarella appetizer which gave her an upset stomach later that evening.  The tomatoes were saturated with the balsamic, like they were floating in it.  I had a caesar salad which was very good.


We both had the 8oz filets, which were served with 5 different sauces to choose from.  Very nice flavors in all of them.  I wish more steak houses did a sauce selection.  The filets could not have been 6oz, maybe smaller.  Must be another perk of the dinner/show package.  They were very tasty.  My wife had the mashed potato side (which she said tasted like instant potatoes and didn't eat it) and I had a baked potato. 


All during dinner, our water glasses were constantly kept full by a very friendly and outstanding server and our drinks were refreshed too.  I wish he was our waiter.  I saw a customer giving him a large cash tip which he tried not to take but the customer forced him.


For dessert my wife had the cheesecake and I had the warm chocolate cake.  Both were excellent.  


This should have been our best meal in Vegas ever!  This should have been an outstanding experience with rave reviews.  On our next trip, this should have been a must for us.  However, I've been treated much better at local steak houses here in the Boston area that have better wine lists, include sides with their meals and a wait staff that is happy you have selected their restaurant regardless of the package you are getting.


Would we have had a better experience by not being part of a dinner/show package?  Probably, but I'll never know.",,Bad,Good
"The prices suggest you are going to get top quality food, prepared to perfection but that was not our experience. The guys that got the steaks seemed pretty happy with the meat but everythihg else was below par. I had the chilean seabass for an entree (i know eating fish at a steakhouse not smart but i dont eat meat and the meal was to celebrate someone else's birhthday) it was an ok size of fish but the sauce seemed like it had been microwaved on and was so, so salty, even parts of the fish with no sauce were very salty. The appetisers and sides were very small and not good at all - between us we ordered alot so i tasted nearly all of them -the only one tht was decent were the brussell sprouts. Our waiter was also very awkward and strange and not helpful.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Reception and service was friendly. Although we had a reservation, the table obviously wasn't ready yet , because we were seated in the lobby had to wait 5 minutes for our table,which surprised us a little because the restaurant didn't seem fully occupied The restaurant is sort of dimly lit which provides a intimite cosy atmosphere.
The crabcakes were delicious as was the (according to the menu) 18 ounce bone in rib eye which really was outstanding and perfectly cooked to order. One could argue that a 62,- pricetag is a little overpriced.",Good,,Good
We had a reservation and were seated immediately at 8:30pm.  The entire dinner for all our group was nearly perfect.  We all had different appetizers and they were ALL good.  Three of us had sea food main courses and they were delicious.  The steaks except for one were cooked perfectly and of course they replaced the incorrect one pretty speedily.  One of our group was celebrating a birthday and they were presented with a very cute little birthday dessert.  All in all it was a Good.,Good,Good,Good
"Overall service and food were good, but the steaks were overcooked and the time we had to wait between our appetizer and main course was way too long.  Also, our steaks were smaller than the size advertised in the menu. I worked in a steakhouse through college, so I know steaks pretty well.  When I mentioned it, I was told that ""they thought it was large enough to fill me up"".  That was not the point.  Don't tell me we are getting an 8 oz steak and only serve 6.  It is deceptive.  Too many really great steakhouses in Vegas, so we won't be going back.",Good,Bad,Good
"I only go to steak houses if it's someone else's choice, so my review will reflect that.  I started with the crab cake which was very good (portion for one person) and the table ordered soup and salads all were fully enjoyed to rave reviews.  The steaks came and went, everyone seemed very happy.  I had a burger which was good. We ordered very heavy on the sides: truffle mac and cheese, asparagus, whipped potato's Brussels sprouts.  All very good.  Sides are good for sharing, we ordered everything for the table and it was too much food.  No dessert, we were too full. As any good steak house, it was expensive.  5 people just for out food was over $600 so expect to pay.
Service was attentive but the food came out a bit on the slow side.  But perfect so worth the wait.",Good,Good,Good
"We went to dinner stopping at the bar for cocktails.  Bartender was great and made us excellent drinks.  We were seated and promptly had great service and attention by the staff.  I ordered the 18 oz ribeye and my husband had the filtet.  Bread was served warm, water glasses filled regularly and our wine glasses were kept full.  Dinner was excellent.  Both steaks were cooked to perfection and the sides, house cut fries and steamed asparagus were so good.  THEN, as the table was being cleared and the urgency to wipe down the table, remove place mats caught my attention.  It was like ok folks your done..now leave.  But, I stopped one of the staff and ask for coffee and my husband ordered a desert.  We waited and waited..staff scurrying around the other tables as they did ours.  No coffee refill and no desert!  Finally, one of the staff noticed me staring him down.  He turned to me and said in a rude tone, ""what?  do you folks wants something?"" I said ""yes, he ordered desert and I'd like a coffee refill and on top of that our check""!  The look of shock on his face was worth a million dollars.  All of a sudden we have a different waiter at our table apologizing and trying to make us stay for the desert.  I finally had it and told them to get our check.  Never did refill my coffee either!   The tab was $300 and I left a small tip.  It started out awesome but, they flat dropped the ball and then made us feel like we were nothing more but in their way!  So much for fine dining, over priced Vegas meal!  Giving it only 2 stars because the way we felt when left...pissed off!",Good,Bad,Bad
"We ate here while in Vegas because we were looking for a high-end steakhouse. This was one of the only restaurants with same day availability. I can understand why. They are either extremely over-booking or the food is just plain sub-par. Our reservation was for 8:15pm and we were not seated until 8:45p. No apologies were made. 
I ordered a $270 cut of steak to a cook of medium and it was delivered rare. Upon comment, the friendly waitress agreed and obliged my request for a more thorough cooking. It was returned like a hockey puck on the outside yet still rare internally. At that point I just said ""no, thank you"". She was polite and hinted that it happened all the time and that she was sorry.
Every aspect of the service was slow from delivering water to the actual dinner. The only thing presented in a timely fashion was the final bill.
The atmosphere is lively and the decor is beautiful and hip. This is great for a nightclub but not when charging expensive prices and promising to deliver an exceptional meal.
Maybe I caught them on a bad, busy Saturday night but I will NOT be returning.",Bad,Bad,
"2/14/2014
 We had reservations for 6:00pm.  We arrived, gave our name and were told to take a seat.   As my wife was sitting down I told the hostess it was her birthday and she said okay. Three other couples came in after we had checked in and had no reservations - they were walk ups- and were seated before us.  The hostess came over to me again and said what was your name again. We were finally seated.  We waited at least ten minutes for the waitress to come over to our table.  We ask the gentleman whose was  filling our water if he could get the waitress to help us and he did. She came over and we asked her about some of the wine selections. We both each got an appetizer  & entree.  My wife ordered  lamp chops and ask for them very very well done and I ordered the Tomahawk  rib eye medium well.  My wife's lamb chops were stilI to rare and were sent back. I would not recommend this restaurant due the poor, slow service and the fact that our bill for 2 was well over $200. The service was not even close to what it should of been for such a high end location.  We were not looking for anything special but they knew it was her birthday but it was never even mentioned.  We travel to Las Vegas several times a year and this the first restaurant we can suggest anyone not to try.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Reservation was for 8pm. Waited 25 minites to be seated. Tables were chipped and place mats were frayed. So much for a high end restaurant.  On the good side the New York strip was excellent. Cooked perfectly. Ordered a baked potato which came poorly presented and not hot for 12.00. Sent it back and came steaming hot the 2nd time. Bread was fair/ For a high end restaruant the bread should be excellent. Ceasar salad was very good. Wife ordere the hamburger which came overly charred. She could not eat it and sent it back The 2nd one was quite nice and she enjoyed it. Overall was disappointed in the experiece. I was expecting a superior place and found a good but not great place. Jean Geroges needs to come and get it up to a higher level.,,Bad,
"This was an interesting experience.  The cocktails from the bar -- 10/10.  Friendliness of staff 10/10. Quality of food 8/10.  Location 8/10. So, what let it down?  The food simply came out way too quickly and when you are having multiple course as part of the degustation option then you want a bit of time to 'rest' between courses.  At one stage, the next course was coming out even before we'd finished the one in front of us.  It felt as though the staff were a bit new and not coordinating the experience well enough.  The other let down was not having a matching wine pairing for the degustation option -- but the wine choices were nonetheless good.  However, when the food was rushed, so too was the consumption of the wine which spoilt the experience.  If there was a trip advisor 'good' rating, then this would have received that, as it is definitely better than 'average' but not quite 'very good'.  But it is expensive.",Good,Bad,Good
"The atmosphere is Dante's inferno with weird orange and black walls. Rock music uncomfortably adding to other world ambiance. Waiter referred to me, a grandmother as little lady even after asked to stop. The wine steward could not pronounce the vitner nor understood the taste of offerings. As I poured my own wine the waiter slammed into me spilling the wine everywhere. No new bottle was offered. My husband ordered a filet mignon and was served a NY strip. I had the sea bass. It was slimey mushy and extremely fishy due to poor freezind and/or age. The shiitake mushrooms were pure rubber. The only good item was bacon wrapped shrimp. The chopped salad was a shredded mess with jalape√±os that were HOT and not shown on the menu. If you like an evening in hell go there. After aggressive complaints the manager comped the""meal"".",Bad,Bad,Bad
"My wife and I had a nice dinner here on the last night of our trip. My wife wanted to try it because we had a comp from the My Vegas Facebook game for 2 glasses of wine. (As a side note before I go on; with the My Vegas comp certificate you actually get $30 off coupon. The cheapest red wine that I saw was $17 a glass, so you don't really get 2 free glasses of wine. I'm sure they have some wines under $15 ea but I didn't see them.)  This place is expensive. There is no getting around it. The food was good and it has a nice atmosphere, but I doubt we will be back.  It was easily the most expensive meal that my wife and I have had to date in Vegas.",Bad,Good,
"Where do I start? How about atmosphere. It was perfect. Quiet, romantic, very classy. They have a dress code. But, come on, thats not what you want to read about. The food, the food was out of this world! I swear I could eat nothing ever again except for what I had here and be completely satisfied. My husband and I almost always share meals so together we ordered a tomato salad, filet mignon, mashed potatoes with parmesan, Chimay for him and an espresso martini for me. They serve a nice selection of breads before your meal. Our waitress was wonderful! I really can't tell you how awesome the food was, you really have to check it out yourself! Savor and enjoy EVERY bite. It is worth it!",Good,Good,Good
"Jean George Steakhouse is a very unique restaurant. The minute you enter the restaurant, you become surrounded by luxury. The lights are just perfect for a lovely night. I always judge a restaurant by its service. And I was very impressed with service provided by the stuff. I have eaten in this restaurant many times, and it was always an excellent experience. Sometimes I enjoy my dinner at the bar. It makes my dining experience even better. The bartenders are very knowledgeable, and sometimes helped us to choose a meal or pear it with a proper wine. I never had a meal that I did not liked. Steak sauces are excellent, they bring up the taste of meat, and please your pallet. All these things come with a price. However, I would not say that the prices are too high. Just right for a right restaurant..",Good,Good,Good
"Excellent steak (T-bone and Short Rib) and meat dishes from both the regular menu and daily specials.  Good selection of appetizers as well.  Unfortunately, the service was not quite on the same level as the food.  Be prepared for NYC prices nonetheless.",Good,,Bad
"The atmosphere  and decor was really nice. We had a corner table. The bread basket was amazing - sooo much bread and they even offer to bring you more if you want! I had the pork spring rolls to start and my partner had the calamari. I am not a fan of seafood but the calamari was so nice, cooked to perfection with different spices. We both had steak for main which was delecious. I recommend the lobster mash. The staff are very friendly, attentive and know the menu inside out. They will describe the dishes to you. Due to the amount of bread we could not manage a desert! It was expensive but there were cheaper options available such as the burger and you don't really need 2 courses as theportions are so big. It was a nice way to end the holiday.",Good,Good,Good
"This is actually top 2 my top 3 are prime , and also delminico in palazzo . The sauce is the key... Beef are good .. But all good place use prime grade.. So of course the sauce is key and jean george gives I think 4 sauce included and don't charge extra... Many other places do . Food are all good . Not wow beat in your life but it will be all GOOD to very good",Good,,
"The service,decor and the food were very good, however, in relation to the price I would rate the food good. The restaruant is very expensive and the wine list is a mind blower. The tomato,mozzarella salad was okay but the tomatoes left a lot to be desired. The sirloin strip was very good as were the sides of mushrooms and brussel sprouts. The noise level is high but not so loud as to impair conversation at least if you are seated against the wall. I know there are better steakhouses in Vegas, but they are also very expensive.",Good,,Good
"Food was very good but certainly not worth the price.  I think you can get the same steak elsewhere for much less and not miss too much.  Had the bone marrow, not worth it here.  Had the burrata salad, it was awesome.


I don't mind paying higher prices for Good, but it has to be justified.  Here it was not!",Bad,,
"Steaks are very good.   Service fair.  Very good wine list.  Loud.  Long waits.  Acceptable, but not memorable.",Good,,Good
The steaks here are 100% top quality aged and some of the best you will find anywhere.  The service is impeccable and the decor sets the mood for a relaxing and enjoyable evening.  Definitely eat here!,Good,Good,Good
"One of the best meals I've experienced. We were with a group of 75, and we were seated in smaller groups whuch helped to maintain the atmosphere of the restaurant. Service was excellent, and the food was fabulous. The salad course included a version of a caprese salad that was to die for. My filet was cooked perfectly, and the selection of sauces available were unique and tasty. However, the steak needed notjing and was best eaten as it came. Dessert was a molten chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream that was the perfect end to the meal.",Good,Good,Good
"I'm from Chicago so I'm very discerning when it comes to a steak. The steak at Jean Georges was very good (8oz Filet) but I felt it was still something I could get at a local restaurant back home. The price for everything we got was on par with the level of quality of food and service. Where Jean Georges was set apart from some other hotels was their service. We had a group of 15 for a private dining event and they treated us extremely well. The wait staff was friendly and quick. Their wine selection was excellent and not over-priced for what you're getting.


I would definitely recommend Jean Georges to anyone going for a romantic dinner, or a large group like we had... just be prepared to leave your wallet. :)",Good,Good,Good
"Ate there on ney years eve
Restaurant is beautiful + inviting but the service was unprofessional and amateurish !!  They could not even get the courses right for a simple price fix.
Jean George in NYC is my favorite but this experiment is not worthy of his name.
Save 600.00 and go to Prime at Bellagio
The most disappointing part of our trip !!!!!!!-",,Good,Bad
"Had a work-related meal here. Restaurant is in line with the norm nowadays: famous chef lends his name to a restaurant and develops the menu/formula (think Gordon Ramsey etc). Fairly dark inside, and initial reception not overly friendly, even though we had booked for 20 people. Food (steak) was good, with interesting veggies. Nice bread too. Service was patchy: some people at our table had their plates whisked away while others were still eating, although my experience is that this is an accepted practise in the US. Since I did not pay, I can't comment on value for money etc.",Good,,Bad
"After a long flight to Vegas our team of 10 staff were delighted to get a last minute reservation at the Jean Georges Steakhouse at the Aria Resort and Casino.  Upon entering the restaurant we were subdued by moderately dark, intimate lighting in a rich luxurious environment.  The decor was subtle yet elegant and pleasing.  We were served our drinks quickly by a skilled, professional waiting staff who tended to our every desire without being overbearing.  Dinner started with salads, most ordered the Caesar and some the Burrata Mozzella salad, each was divine.  As a main dish, we all ordered the Filet Mignon and numerous side orders to share.  These included: lobster mashed potatos, grilled asparagus, grilled mushrooms and of course french fries!  Each of our Filets was cooked to perfection and was served with an enticing array of sauces to choose from.  Our desserts were indescribably rich, delicious and satisfying!   From start to finish our dining experience was spectacular and I would not hesitate to return to or highly recommend the Jean Georges Steakhouse.",Good,Good,
"I'd give Jean Georges a 4.75 rating. The atmosphere is beautiful, comfortable and intimate, and they have a great eclectic soundtrack playing that really enhanced our enjoyment of the meal. Even better than the food, which is delicious, is the service. Attentive without being overbearing, elegant and professional without being stuffy, this is exactly how I want to be waited on in a restaurant. The waitress had multiple helpers who came by to replenish water and clear plates, and she was genteel, friendly and very helpful. It's amazing what a difference a good server can make.


On to the food. I had the slow-cooked salmon, which came with steamed spinach. It was tender and perfectly cooked. A big hit at the table (we dined with a group of six) was the Chilean sea bass. The portion is generous but not too large, and it was cooked to perfection. Also amazing were the lobster mashed potatoes, the mac and cheese and the roasted brussels sprouts. I had the tuna tartare with my dinner and it was accompanied by this wafer-thin rice cake which looked a little strange but tasted like a little piece of heaven. My husband had the filet, which he loved. It had several interesting and delicious sauces served alongside.


Also, don't miss the bacon-wrapped shrimp. Wow. We had three orders of that!


The assistant sommelier didn't have the knowledge we'd expect from a five star dining experience, but he was lovely and efficient. We ordered the Plumpjack (delicious), the Joseph Phelps Insignia 2008 (not a hit, a bit flat and overly tannic) and brought our own bottle of 2005 Araujo.


There is a wine room for larger parties and a few smaller private dining areas if you have a special event or birthday dinner. Overall, I'd highly recommend this and would definitely dine here again.",Good,Good,Good
Great tasting food but very small portions for $175/person. Would have been better value if the price included wine pairings.,Bad,,
"This steak was on special and was the most delicious meat I have ever put in my mouth. My husband is very quiet but has not stopped talking about the steak! I cannot describe the flavor, but it was out of this world.  A reall must!!",Good,Good,
This is a great steakhouse. Our second time coming here and it was again a pleasure. The food is decadent and the steaks to die for. They bring out four sauces plus include a sauce on your plate. Tried them all and loved the scotch bonnet sauce. Service was great. The atmosphere shy one clown who talked REAL loud was quiet and comfortable. I fully recommend dining here.,Good,Good,Good
"I stopped one night to have a drink at Jean George Steakhouse to meet up with some people. As I was sitting and having a drink, someone on the other side of the bar were ordering food. The food looked so first-class I asked for a menu.  Ordered the lamb chops ,with some sides and sauces. The sauce gave the lamb a fantastic taste. The lamb was cooked perfectly on open wood burning grill. 
I come to Vegas often and know a lot of places, have eaten here before and the food is always great. So stop in one night and be surprised how great the food , really is.",Good,,
"Our group of 9 were really looking forward to our dinner. Service was exactly what so many reviews said....non existent! For average 100 per person  meal including a drink, you expect better! Service was really disappointing. Staff seemed uninterested, and not attentive. My husbands mash potatoes had the watery consistency of packaged mashed potatoes. When complaining, we were told they where extra whipped! Baked potato on its own is 14.00. We expected better. I'd say our local Keg does a better job. I'd say Tender at the Luxor is better service and food wise. Price wise the same, however, if you are satisfied with your meal, there is no complaint.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We celebrated my birthday in Las Vegas and had dinner at Jean Georges.  Although it is not cheap, we had a very good meal.  The wait staff was very attentive.  My wife and I shared a salad, a porterhouse steak, and a baked potato.  Enough food for 2,  without an extra charge for sharing.  The steak was perfectly done.  And I even got a gratis birthday dessert (molten chocolate cake and ice cream).  First class all the way.",Good,Good,Good
"Went here for our 1 year anniversary, host was very nice, waiter was very slow to get our drinks and our bread. I ordered the wagyu filet mignon with broccoli and sauce picked from the chief so I, when I got the meal I got a dry steak, no sauce and they did not give me the broccoli. The steak was average, it was nothing specail, burnt.Waiter came around to ask how everything was I reminded him of what I ordered and what I got, by the end of our meal I still did not get the broccoli- dishes were picked up bill was given waiter came back and realized I Still did not get my broccoli, he overed a taste of cake .... By this point I was super pissed and just wanted to get out of there. My boyfriend was also very upset with the meals, the screw up and we both agreed the only thing good about this steakhouse was they kept our water topped.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Took advantage of their pre theatre set dinner meal and enjoyed what we had. Nothing wrong with any part of it but not very exciting either. Steak was perfect. Perhaps you get what you pay for!,Good,Good,
it was more like chain restaurant hard. For a medium well steak it was so over cooked and dry that i couldn't finish it. The sides had no flavor. BUT the bread and the salad were great! (also beware the servers try hard to upsell you),Bad,,
"I had the small filet.  It was a tad on the undercooked side.  One member of our party had to send her steak back twice before they got it right - and she's not hard to please.  I've eaten at Gallagher's in NYNY, and I think they do a better job.",Bad,,
"Good setting, excellent staff (although keen to upsell), food was as good as you will get at a steakhouse. Would get ""excellent"" review but price a bit toppy.",Good,Good,Good
"This is probably a great steak house. At least if it lives up to the prices :)
The decor is interesting with fairly abstract back-lit cow designs. Disclaimer: we were there for Thanksgiving dinner, so our experience may not have been representative.
The wait person took a long time to take our drink order, and offended the two women in our partner when he chose one of the men to provide the wine list (which is one an iPad.) Turns out the two women are much more knowledgeable about wine than the men and wondered why the wait person had not asked who would like to look at the wine list. I must admit that although I see the benefits of the iPad (can update availability and prices quickly) I did not think it was as convenient as a more traditional wine list would have been. This was very linear.....I had to keep ""paging"" through until I found the medium-body American reds that I was looking for. In a more traditional wine list I can just quickly find the section I am looking for.
I did not consider our wait person friendly, more matter-of-fact, but was knowledgeable and answered questions.
As soon as we asked a question about the wine, he immediately told us he would send the ""Som"" over to help us. And the sommelier was very helpful. We asked his opinion of two bottles, both approximately $60-$70 and were happy with our choice. Given prices on the Strip, and the prices at this restaurant, the wine was a big hit.
The food received a mixed review from our party of 4, although we all ordered the turkey with different starters. 
I found the look of the turkey strange.....one of the members of the party immediately commented, upon having the plates delivered, ""this looks like a turkey roll."" And it did. Diameter was about the size of a slice of bologna, but about 3/4 of an inch thick. The taste was good, if a bit dry (but then we are talking turkey.) It was not chopped turkey or anything like that, just not what you would expect. Same with the dressing, which was liked by some but not all at the table. But then dressing is one of those things everyone has an opinion about, based on their own family memories.
The burrata salad had a mixed reception as well. The mozarella was wonderfully creamy and flavorful, the tomatoes, while not cold, seemed much cooler than would be expected. I prefer tomatoes to be closer to room temperature and these were not.
What was universally panned at our table was the clearing of the table before everyone had finished their plate. This used to be considered a bit rude, but happened at one other restaurant on this trip, so maybe its a trend. If so, not a good trend. The second time they tried the ""Are you finished with your plate"" a member of the party indicated that not everyone had yet finished and we did not wish to have our plates cleared until everyone had.
So this may be a great place to come for a superb steak dinner. This was only the second time I've eaten at this restaurant, and don't think i would return. My overall comment would be its a mixed experience, with nothing being outstanding.
For the cost, and compared to other Jean Georges restaurants I've tried (including New York,) I would give this ""ok"". Nothing special compared to other options.",,,
"My $65 waygu steak was cooked perfectly but was only so-so quality. My husbands NY strip was ordered medium rare and was received medium well. Since we had show tickets there was no time to return the meals. The service was impeccable so good points there. Our $65 bottle of wine was fine.  Just a lot of money for a ""meh"" meal.",Bad,,Good
"Inside the almost new Aria hotel and casino and   there are several restaurants more or less expensive and cool. Among these we had dinner at this well appointed steakhouse with dark wall and an IPAD wine list. In the more usual menu we choose a good tuna roll ( I remembered better in New York) and of course delicious steaks, Skip the desert there is a great patisserie downstairs.
Very professional service, but for the price I like a white table coat. The TV at the bar are awful and downgrade the great atmosphere of the place.",Good,Bad,Good
"Best filet mignon I have ever had! It was medium rare, juicy, flavourful, and tender but with no blood oozing out! Side dishes of cream spinach and mash potatoes in small cast iron containers were excellent as well. Service was good and the cheese cake was just too delicious to resist! The plating was visually pleasing and creative. All appetizers and entrees were served on very heavy stone crockery which helped to retain the heat of the entrees as well.


Loved the decor as well! I would defs pay Jean Georges a visit again:)",Good,Good,Good
"This is the second time we've eaten here and enjoyed it both times.  I had made a reservation on OpenTable, and it didn't seem to be on their list when we arrived, however she found it when she did a search.  


We had both the Waygu steak and the 300 day aged steak, and both were fantastic.  We had the lobster mash and brussels (which were better than the asparagus).  


We liked having the wine list on the ipad - it allowed you to save your selections which we then talked to the sommalier about.  She was good and she even recommended a reasonably priced wine for us over the more expensive options.  


It is dark inside, and I do wish it was a bit brighter - makes it hard to see the menus.  Also, the black bread plates on our table when we arrived were chipped at the edges - not a great first impression.",Good,Bad,Good
I ate here a few times.  Steaks were cooked perfectly except once was too rare but they took it back no questions and got it my liking. Side dishes of grilled asparagus was good as was the starter of buffalo mozzarella.  It's not cheap easily 100 per person and more depending on the wine u select   Will go back when In the Mood for steaks,Good,Good,
"We made a reservation through the hotel service 30 minutes before we showed up.  There was a small bit of confusion of the hostess not finding the 7.30pm res.  However, this was handled in 10 seconds by the fellow standing with her, and we were shown through the interesting bar to a wonderful table.  I don‚Äôt think there could be a bad table in this beautiful, quiet restaurant.  The service all evening was perfect.  The service staff of three were always there with more water, wine and any needs filled, but they were never in the way.  Couple this with a great menu and wine list, and we had a perfect evening.  Three of us were at the table and ordered completely different menu items.  All of the food was great and served in a timely manner.  The steaks were perfectly done and very flavorful.  We watched other folks rush through dinner.  We weren‚Äôt in a hurry, and the wait staff didn‚Äôt rush us.  After I chose a fun bottle of sparkling wine from Alsace, the sommelier steered us to a well-priced bottle of red wine.  I‚Äôm glad there was a good sommelier because the wine list on an ipad was awkward for me.  This was heavy, somewhat difficult to use and would shut off if I was reading the wine descriptions. It did allow for good wine description/notes and a way to select wines to consider.  Then the selected wines can be refined to the final choice.  Be ready for this tech experience.  (OK, so they save a tree, but use electricity, not to mention trashed ipads in the landfill.  How is this a green foot print?  This is not a negative comment, it is just an observation.)  Overall, this expensive meal was worth the money, and we would recommend Jean Georges",Good,Good,Good
"We (2 couples) dined at Jean Georges Steakhouse at the Aria this last weekend (Nov 2012). Food and service were exceptional. We did not have creeping waiter or obnoxious photog as others have mentioned so maybe we got lucky or they toned it down. Our waiter was absolutely excellent. We had the ""tasting menu"" which featured a bacon wrapped shrimp, a delicate and virtually perfect seabass and the specialty was a Waygu Filet which I would have to say was truly one of the best steaks I have ever had in my life. Really, it was that good. Everything else was good to great, but the steak was extraordinary. 
A little pricey but what you would expect. My only complaint (or negative comment) would be that I (only one of the 4 of us) had the wine pairing with my meal. A couple of the glasses arrived late and the waiter was unsure of the wine description for a couple of the glasses. He did quickly get the info, but the wine needs to be on time and this info should be known. 
The steak was out of this world. The tasting menu was vey nice. I would recommend that. One of our group got a ""orange elder flower martini"" which was unusual and a very nice light specialty drink if you feel like experimenting:)",Good,Good,Good
"My impression of this place is based on the prices, it is an upscale steakhouse.  


Based on our experience here, it is a mediocre steakhouse.


The service was adequate and business-like, but not very interactive.


The food...wonderful oysters (6 for $20), baked macaroni with black truffles (needed more ""gooey-ness"" was kind of dry and earthy.  My Kumamoto wagyu ($360 for 12 oz NY Strip) was the best steak I have ever eaten!  It was prepared perfectly (rare/medium rare) and was worth every penny.  6 ounces would have been plenty because it is very rich in flavor!  My wife's filet mignon was a disappointment.  the top of the filet was cooked, the bottom looked like it was cut?  My wife is not the type of person to send back, so she ate it begrudgingly.  Mashed potatoes were equivalent of Joel Robuchon's pommes puree!  Tons of butter, lots of stirring over heat, finished by pushing through a sieve.   Extremely delicious!


Great wine list.


Something just doesn't work here.  The decor (dark, black and red), the music, and the service staff don't add up to upper tier steakhouse.  If the filet mignon were good, I would be rating the food as excellent.   Filet mignon should be a given at a great steakhouse.


I prefer SW Steakhouse at Wynn.",Good,Bad,
"i was there for a wedding dinner the food was fantastic. we were supposed to be at a restaurant that had just closed and my friends were lucky enough to have it here.
the tuna tartar was unbelievable so good with a ton of flavor. I also had a filet which i am not always a big fan of but this was tender and  alot of flavor.
The have an excellent wine list and the drinks were awesome, i highly recommend the Frogs Leap Cabernet excellent. The service was outstanding and I just can't recommend this place enough. It is expensive but if your going to splurge for dinner this is the place!",Good,Good,Good
"Eating out (properly!) in Las Vegas isn't that cheap these days but when it came to steak, Jean Georges was worth it. We didn't book in advance but were offered a high table next to the bar which was excellent. Food was superb and good wine selection.",Good,Good,
"The restaurant has a traditional steakhouse atmosphere; dark subdued tones, lots of wood, and very experienced staff.  Our wait staff included several people; all were very polite but not overly friendly.  Service was prompt but not ""hovering"" -  we were taking our time and did not feel rushed.  


The food was very good, the wine list was extensive, and everyone had a good time.  Maybe the best part was someone else picked up the tab!  Given the prices here, that was a good thing.",Good,Good,Good
"Six of us ate here on a Sunday night as we had $75 food credits from the Aria Hotel.  Since I am a firm believer that the LV buffets offer you the best value and overall quality, we would have eaten there except it was closed for renovations


J-GS was our next choice since it was next to the new Cirque du Soleil show Zarkana at the Aria Hotel.  


On the plus side, the food quality was good (we all had filets), the service was attentative, and we had a nice, quiet table in the back,


On the negative side, the food was way over salted -- one of us had to send her steak and mushrooms back to be redone and that took almost another 30"".  We were eating the pre-theatre special as we were on a tight time schedule in order to make our show at 7:00 pm. The redone steak arrived back so late that we had to have it boxed to go so we could be on time for Zarkana.


I wasn't able to eat my chocolate cake dessert as I spent the last 15"" of our time trying to figure out the very complex bill we received.  


Finally, some of us got side orders without asking the price (shame on us).  I think $16 for a small side of saut√©ed mushrooms is excessive especially when they were so salty you couldn't eat them.  The other sides were equally in the stratosphere cost-wise.


With the myriad number of steak houses in Las Vegas, this is not one we will return to.  


The wait staff does get high marks, however.",Bad,,Good
"Went here for about the third time and were really disappointed.  The food was ok, though had to send back a raw steak that was supposed to be medium rare.  It was the $96 tomahawk steak so for that price you really want it cooked properly!  The person on the table next to us seemed to be having the same problem with some lamb chops.
The service was very average and certainly not friendly.  We had to ask to hear the specials, we only knew that there would be some as we had been before.  We only had 1 course and a couple of drinks each (half of these non-alcoholic) and the bill came to $300.  Left feeling a  bit ripped off and also tired because it is so dark in there!  Probably won't go back.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We arrived at the restaurant at 10 pm.  The staff notified us that the kitchen closes at 10:30 but still offered to seat us.


The food overall was average for a high end restaurant.  I ordered the 8 oz prime filet for $54.  It was very good.  I expected it to be good.  My wife had the Sea Bass.  It was also very good.  The appetizers and salads were good but very expensive (a simple iceberg wedge salad was $18) and the truffle fries were very good and cost $18.  The cheese fritters were mediocre (I can always tell by whether or not they are all eaten).  Raw oyster appetizer was $20 for 6 and they were good.


The big problem with this restaurant was the service and the high price.  Overall the food was very good, as to be expected.  The reason I am giving 2 stars (I would give 2.5) is that the service and the food doesn't justify the high price you will pay.  There are so many other great restaurants where you can spend $150 per person and get much better service and better food.  


The server kept saying to us ""well I can check with the kitchen to see if they will make that and I'll have to check whether they have shut everything down"" meaning that they weren't interested in serving us and really didn't want to make that $14 small plate of broccoli or that $12 Creme Brulee.


Overall, we felt rushed and like they were doing us a favor to serve us.  If you are a big gambler at the ARIA and this is a complimentary meal, go ahead.  If you are paying, maybe try another place.  We went to Wolfgang Puck's Cut in the Palazzo, which cost about the same as this restaurant and the service was much much better and food was better as well.",Good,Bad,Bad
"This was outstanding. The only reason I didn't rank it a 5 is the pricing. OUTRAGEOUS. They could cut their prices by 15 - 20% and still be insanely profitable.  I enjoy excellence at every level, and this place has it (I don't get the reviews about poor service) 
Get the seafood appetizer
The Tomahawk Chop
Get a very stiff drink before you talk to the Sommelier, another seriously seriously over priced.
The good news, i would go back.  
Perhaps the most beautiful restaurant i have eaten in.",,Good,
"i made note to the restaurant that we were celebrating four 50 yr milestone birthdays, first there was no mention, nothing at all to acknowledge. As the three servers began to rattle the specials and appetizer ideas,in a very awkward set up of a table, four of our group had arms and elbows in their face continuously and during this explanation and confusion we were almost tricked into a $450.00 appetizer!, as more trickery continued, we became very apprehensive to ordering much else. The main entrees were good although small for a steakhouse(especially in Vegas)everyone finished everything, even the ladies, the stars are for food quality only.Not one of the 8 of us would return.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Heard good things about this restaurant so we decided we would go there for dinner our first night of our two week (anniversay) trip.  Service was good to a point.  Table for two in a high quality steakhouse was to be seated right beside another couple (strangers) ... so much for intimacy.  Sitting so close to each other you can hear each other's conversations.  
Even though you explain to the waiter/waitress that you are in no hurry and do not want to order right away, they continue to hound you to the point that you feel pressured into ordering.  They snuck up so quietly behind you it was almost like being in the ""Mr Deeds"" movie with the butler that wanted to change the socks.  
Food was ok - I had steak (not the greatest) my husband had the lamb which he was not overally impressed with.  Would not hurry back.",,,
"Do not miss this restaurant.  Ambiance, service, food, all 5 star.  I will always get one night here when in Vegas.  The only thing that I would change would be to eliminate the photographer completely.  This guy is nice but nervous, annoying, and not appropriate for this dining experience, sorry he's a nice guy but...",Good,Good,Good
"Pretty much the only reason we decided to dine there since we had nice $75 credit - we didn't quite realized how quickly it will ran out.
We ordered crabcake(s) as an appetizer - at $24 portion one would kinda expect to have at least two pieces - no such luck - a single and very average small piece we could barely split to taste.


We both ordered fish - Sea bass and halibut. The later was whole grilled, soft and mild in flavor, but the prior while was cooked properly - was WAY over spiced to levels places like Applebees do... Too much of sauce = bad


Guys - Sorry, I didn't tried any of Australian ""wagu"" like steaks since $300/steak is a bit rich even for me",Bad,,
"I ate here with business associates while attending a conference.  My steak was prepared to perfection, and the presentation on the plate was great, with a nice variety of sauces provided.  The service was unparralleled - there seemed to be two or three servers working the table constantly.  The lighting was a bit dim, I guess to create atmosphere.  The only drawback is the extremely high prices.  We knew this going in, but some in our group could not join us because of budget limits.  Aside from that, the overall experience was great.",Good,Good,Good
It was the worst restaurante that we visited in our 10 day trip to Vegas. There is a lot of other better options. Not recommended.,,Bad,
"Yeah so, had the 8oz filet mignon which was cooked just the way I like it (Medium rare). DELICIOUS and there were a mix of sauces to try with it. The truffle fries were also great! Beer selections were good.


The atmosphere in the place however was not great, was too dark, could barely see my plate!",Good,Bad,
"It's been awhile since we've had excellent steak.  Don't get me wrong - it's not like I go to the Outback or Bugaboo or Longhorn or Texas Roadhouse (all chains).  I eat at the Capital Grille, Ruth's Chris, Smith & Wollensky, Ken Oringer establishments.  But I haven't had a proper steak in a long, long time and I was seriously ready for a nice rare dry steak!  Ok, so I paid (not overpaid) for a beautiful 6oz Wagyu filet but did it ever bring tears to my eyes.  I sang to it, professed my love to it, offered to smuggle it back home with me in my purse.  But alas, it only wanted to be in my belly.  Oh dear, sweet steak.  My husband ordered the ribeye and although it was thinner than other ribeyes I've seen, it was still beckoning in its glossy red/purple rareness - like a supermodel showing off its ""rare"" couture.  Their hangers-on/fanclub/sidekicks of truffle-comte fritters showed off on their own in their lime-salt fanciness.  So delicious, they didn't overpower but presented themselves as the perfectly accented accessories they were.
The service was fantastic and our server pointed us to a reasonably-priced Cabernet (Daou) that provided the perfect back-lighting to our bovine fantasty.  What an absolutely perfect night to a perfectly decadent destination!!!",Good,Good,Good
"My friend and I were in Vegas celebrating her birthday. She chose Jean Georges for her birthday dinner. I was going to buy her dinner but once I saw the prices, I told her she was on her own! Wonderful service; fantastic food; very expensive; awesome experience!",Good,Good,Good
"At the Aria hotel, walking distance from Bellagio and Vdara (same complex) however US$300 for two people, some OK wines but only one course is over the top.  Better steak houses in LV for the price.  Service over the top.  Seemed to have 3 waiters attending at anyone time.  Not a busy restaurant.  Unless you are on a Las Vegas money roll and not concerned with price then why not?",Good,Good,Good
"i have dined there twice this summer. once around the first of june and again about july 15. the two steaks i've had there were the best i've had in a long time. oh yeah,the service was top notch also.",Good,,Good
"We had a wonderful evening. Great drinks (Bloody Mary is awesome), unmatched service and very delicious food and a very nice venue. This all comes with a corresponding price tag. However, you get what you pay for. Will recommend with pleasure.",Good,Good,Good
"This is a very good steakhouse. Was amazing. I ate a Tomato soup that was really really good and a Porterhouse 24oz... wow!!!
The portion are perfect, maybe the filet mignon 8 oz is pretty smaller, but the porterhouse is fantastic.
Don't miss it.",Good,Good,
"My husband and I have dined there twice and all  we can say is yummy both times!!
The wine list is phenomenal
The staff is so helpful and they make sure that everything is perfect
The atmosphere is romantic
The restaurant is nicely designed
The menu has plenty to choose from
We cannot wait to return",Good,Good,Good
"I started with delicious oysters, proceeded to tomato & hearts of palm salad (best ever) and the entree was lamb chops.  The sommelier recommended a lovely pinot noir.  I recommend this restaurant highly.  Great, attentive staff.",Good,Good,Good
"I have certainly had better food, service and prices.  The idea that they would try to sell a 6oz. steak for $150 is absurd.  That was not far off of virtually everything on the menu.  While the appetizers were excellent and the steak was...well it was a steak, nothing was worth the price.
Although my party had reservations, we still waited for 20 minutes for a table.  Not very impressive.
Overall, just ok.",Bad,,
The highlight of our dinner here is the tomahawk steak. If your a meat lover and can afford it. It's a must.,Good,,
This was my third time here. The first was during the first month they were opened. That was a disaster so I tried again last year. It was good but not over the top for this town. I went back again this weekend and again was not overly impressed. They have reduced the portion sizes and kept the prices high. Food was just average. It is a nice place with Good but there are several steak houses in the area that are way better. I would not make a special trip to to here. But it will do for convienent dinner.,Bad,,Good
"I went with a large group of people for my first experience. The restaurant ambiance is first class, the service is impeccable but the cooks should lay off on the salt a little.  Everyone enjoyed their meal while one person complained that his steak was overcooked.",Bad,Good,Good
"Had the best piece of Rib in Vegas at Jean Georges, the restaurant is very nice decorated.
And the service was absolutly in top !",Good,Good,Good
"We actually ate here 2 nights in a row. We both enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. The second night in, we swapped entrees, so that we each had what the other had last night. We just loved the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp & the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail. The Lobster main was fantastic too as was the Sea Bass. Like our night at Sage the staff here were very attentive without being pushy. Our second night they were a little slow to get going, but still pretty good. 
We have recommended them to our company next time they are in town.",Good,Good,Good
"It's really loud and dark inside. The food is good, but not great and nothing special at all. Typical steakhouse faire. Nothing inventive.  For the price and venue I would have expected much more.  You can do better elsewhere as there's no shortage of steakhouses.",,Bad,
"Simply dreadful.  I'm being generous with one star,  but the restaurant is lovely, the wine list is exciting (if not pompous and overpriced),  the mozzarella on the tomato\mozzarella\balsamic appetizer   was exquisitely fresh, the wait staff was attentive (albeit arrogant and dishonest)  and the strip steak from one of our group was supposedly delicious - - But that's all the good I can say.


We visitied JGS last night. We sensed we should have left after my wife ordered a vodka gimlet- which was merely some chilled vodka with a piece of lime placed in it.  When the waiter told us that he had watched the bartender squeeze an entire lime into the drink, he had no explanation as to why the vodka was clear and not bearing the cloudy remnants of having had all of that fresh lime squeezed into it or any evidence of any lime juice


Oh well-  that's just the drink.  But the meal went downhill from there. Three of us in the party order lobster tails, which were all rubbery (at least they were consistent).  My veal chop (ordered medium), was undercooked and fatty (and inedible).  Having taken only 2 bites out of it,   I told one of the wait staff that I couldn't eat it and they neither offered to replace it or take it off the bill.  They even screwed up a side of spinach, as it was overly salty and also inedible.


In short - if you have limited time in Vegas and want to enjoy a fine, upscale dining experience- --  then go someplace else.",Bad,Bad,Good
"Went here with 7 colleagues on work incentive trip. Great contempary decor & low lights.
Has oriental style lobster to start, with soy sauce & ribbons of fresh ginger. Very fresh & clean tasting. Had a 'tomerhawk' steak special with lobster mash & steamed asparagus, washed down with some lovely French merlot.
One of the best steaks I have ever eaten! I will return in October when I next visit Vegas & can't wait.",Good,Good,
Fab food. The Filet was to die for absolute melt in the mouth. Had creamed corn and mash for sides and they too were beautiful. Would defiantly Reccomend it. They even gave us complimentary desert chocolate melt in the middle cake with ice cream and happy anniversary written on the plate lively food :-),Good,Good,Good
"Food was excellent.  Attentive service.  A bit pricey, but the decor and atmosphere are worth it.  Set inside the Aria, one of the nicest hotels on the strip.",Good,Good,Good
"A bit pricey for an average steak.  There are much better options in Vegas for steak.  STK @ Cosmo across the street or for value check out whatever available cut at the Aria buffet, it will leave you feeling better about yourself with money in your pocket to turn into millions on slot machines.",Bad,,
"I'll be honest: I'm not an usual customer of this kind of steakhouse/restaurant when in Vegas.
I eat wonderful steaks in the area where I live for very low prices (just two days ago I ate a huge steak for 10 ‚Ç¨ - 13 $), and in the southwest you can often have great steaks for 25 $ or so.
But during my last stays at Aria I had a 100$ resort credit, so I decided to indulge.
My first time has been good. My second, horrible.
The restaurant is very nice and classy. Greeted, fast serviced (always been there at 5 pm. opening).
This time I ordered a 26oz. rib eye at 95$. Yes, 95$.
Now, it's true that a mistake can happen (the steak eaten on first visit was ok), but at 95$ if it happens, it MUST be fixed.
My steak arrived and was incredibly fatty. Not only all around, but also in the inner part. Meat melted with nerves and fat, everywhere.
Now, you should know everyone passing by asks you how it was your meat (it's boring when you're bringing a fork to your mouth. At least, make an agreement and let just one waiter do the question, please!).
Everyone had the same answer. The steak was horrible (the fact half of it has been left in the plate could have been a hint)
Well, no one could care less. At best, an assertive head movement.
Don't ask if you don't care! This makes me even more upset!
Anyway, my bill arrived in full. Not an offer of bringing a steak replacement, not an offer of compensation, not even an apology. So, I paid a total 120$ bill for a crappy, fatty, half-eaten steak and no other, no appetizer, no dessert, no wine.
Oh, yes, they bring a wonderful bread. Really tasty and in different shapes.
I asked for another basket of it after refusing the steak. At that point, I was really afraid to add 50$ to the bill and eat some other horrible thing.
So, if you don't mind spending over one hundred for some wonderful bread, this is your place",Bad,Good,Good
We have eaten here twice while staying at Aria and it is excellent.  We like to do a steakhouse on our last night of a trip to Vegas.  My husband is very picky abut how the steak is cooked and Jean Georges cooked it perfectly.  We asked to split a steak and they sliced it up and presented it in the center of the table for us to decide who ate how much.  Salad and grilled asparagus were perfect.  Atmosphere is wonderful.  Be sure to make reservations as it is a poplular steakhouse - and for good reason.,Good,Good,
"Took the reviews online with a grain of salt, that was my mistake.  Service was acceptable, food was not.  Never had mozzarella that was in liquid form  before,  but that's what they serve here with tomatoes.  My bacon wrapped shrimp was extremely salty.  The steak was hardly the highlight of my meal either.  I have had steak in some of the nation's best steakhouses and can honestly say that my steak was average to below average.  The staff that greeted me were cold to apathetic, that should have been my first clue.  The second clue was that this restaurant was half empty.   There are much better choices in LV for steak.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We visited the steakhouse for the first time about a 8 months prior and had an exceptional expierence.  We have been looking forward to going back. Tried to make reservations but the only opening was at 9:45pm, so we took that.  Got there and the rest. was basically empty.  What I was looking forward to the most was the roasted bone marrow. Utterly disappointed because when it arrived to the table it was so small and I could not even scrape enough from the bone to get one bite. Brought it to the waiters attention but he could care less and did not take it off the bill. Next was that fact that all I wanted was their fantastic sea scallops. However was informed by the waiter that they are no longer being served.  STILL to this day they are listed on their website menu.  I fine the 2nd time there was overpriced, service average and the food was so so.  We would not go back and would not recommend this steakhouse to anyone I know.",Bad,Bad,
"I fully understand that the celebrity chef restaurants in Las Vegas seldom actually have that chef in the kitchen.  However, my experience has been that if properly supervised by an executive chef and staffed with trained and experienced cooks, the resulting product can be excellent.  Based on my recent dinner at Jean Georges, I have to wonder who they have doing the cooking these days?  I ordered the shrimp wrapped in bacon appetizer at $22.  Pretty expensive for three medium sized shrimp.  I found that the bacon totally overwhelmed the flavor of the shrimp plus making them way too salty.  My waiter suggested I try just three shrimp simply grilled which I agreed to.  When the new appetizer arrived they were way over grilled and totally tasteless.  On to the main course:  Grilled lamb chops.  My waiter said these were particularly good as they had a nice crust from their wood fired grill.  When the three chops arrived I noted that they did not have that nice wood fired crust, but more importantly they were incredibly fatty and not particularly flavorfull.  Overall, not a good dining experience.",Bad,Bad,
"Did the tasting menu at Jean Georges Steakhouse in the Aria along with the wine pairings.  The caviar was murky and paired with Meyer lemon gelee that just didn't work at all.  Shrimp in proscuttio was one piece of overcooked shrimp.  The sea bass portion was prepared perfectly, but about the size of a half-dollar.  I expected the steak, to be the highlight of the meal, given that this is a ""Steakhouse"" but it was overcooked, although the Scotch Bonnet sauce was amazingly good.  At $109 and $55 for the wine, I head to Morton's, the Palm or Ruth's Chris and do a real Steakhouse",Bad,Bad,
"We had high hopes for this steakhouse, but it was a downward spiral right from the start as they seated us 20 mintues late of our reservation.  The atmosphere was not what I would want a high-end steakhouse to be like.  It was very open and very noisy, more like a cafeteria than an elegant restaurant.  It was hard to have pleasant conversation with the loud 80's alternative music playing and the jovial tables that surrounded us.  


Started with the pear, apple & endive salad which was quite good, but that's where the satisfaction ended.  We then waited an additional 45 minutes before our steaks were served.  Our waiter appoligized for the tardiness and also mentioned that some of our sides were not ready yet, but he would bring them out as soon as they were.


My filet mignon was good, but not great.  My husband's NY strip however, was bloody and well undercooked.  The truffle frites were actually yummy, but the steak fries were dry and hard.  Half way through the meal our brussle sprouts showed up and they were just plain old nasty.  Our waiter said we wouldn't be charged for our late sides and also offered us free dessert.  Unfortunately that too was a total dissapointment.


All in all, this place was way over-priced and way-under satisfactory.",Bad,Bad,
"We had made a reservation and were shown to an unattractive, undersized able for two by a workstation which would only just have been acceptable if the restaurant were busy. It was not and we asked to be moved. Bad start!  I had been looking forward to a steak but, when the menu arrived, I was astounded by the prices. $65 for a 6oz steak (ok, wagyu - emperor's new clothes??).  My husband enjoyed a nicely cooked seabass dish though. The fries with my order were cold and had to be replaced. My advice would be to try the other great restaurants in this hotel and give this one a miss.",Bad,Bad,
Jean Georges never disappoints in New York and his Steakhouse in the Aria Hotel was no exception. Nothing more to say...,,Good,
"I don't care how rich you are this place is way way overpriced.  Seriously, a $18 dollar side of mushrooms had maybe two sliced quarter sized mushrooms.  It would have fit easily in two spoons.  I don't want to complain about the food because it was good, but the prices were amazing.  We like nice places and have been to Picasso and other nice Resteraunts, but this one is over the top.  There were 8 of us and we were all a little amazed.  Skip this one and and go to a another nice Resteraunt and a show for the same price.  I hate to give this bad review because the food was good, but does not come close to  justifying  the prices.  I suspect that when they set the prices they laughed and said ""can you believe someone paid this much for a side salad"".  Surely even they were embarrassed.",Bad,,
"Booked a 6:45 reservation through the concierge...6:30 was full.  When we arrived the place was almost empty...what's that all about?
Nice selection of breads and two glasses of wine to start.  Salads were fresh and slightly over dressed.  She had the lobster which is steamed, removed from the shell and dipped in tempura batter and fried.  Excellent!  My New York strip steak was cooked to medium-rare perfection with a choice four sauces...spicy butter, classic steak sauce, bearnaise, and one other I can't remember.
Service was prompt, cordial, and professional.",Good,,Good
"Dined at this resto in Aria in October 2011 with friends and my wife.  We had high expectations, given prior experience with Jean Georges' restaurants.  Ordered expensive steaks and calamari as an appy -- both were not up to par.  The calamari stuck together and although the dipping sauce was tasty it couldn't save the dish.  I was shocked they even served the clumped up squid together -- it was obvious when it was first set down on the table.  And for $20?  No thanks.  Finally, the steak was tasty but I had asked for it Chicago style.  The waiter said no problem, and out it comes and... little to no char.  Very disappointing for a steakhouse of this supposed calibre/price.  We won't be back.",Bad,Bad,
"We stayed at Aria when we came to a Bob Seeger concert on the 30th.  We had booked dinner back in Nov, when we knew we would be around for New year's Eve. It looked to be a special menu & was, but not really worth $150 for the ""lower end"" and $250 for the deluxe meal. The food was good but not outstanding. The service was coldly efficient, common in Las Vegas I have found. I ordered rack of lamb, received a filet and was told, ""Oh, I was sure you ordered filet."" Not very gracious, especially when your set menu costs $150! I had a nice half bottle of wine with my meal. My partner had sparkling water. With the tip our bill was around $525.  I have had far bette meals for far less.  I would come back for the regular menu next time.  On New Years there was no option. Disappointing at best.  A complimentary glass of champagne would have been a nice touch.   I don't mind paying for Good and service but this was a bit marginal for the money.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Went with a group of business colleagues.  Several of shared steaks, and the restaurant was very accomodating.  The sides included truffled mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts and mushrooms over polenta.  They are individual plates, and at steep prices.  We nonetheless found that we could share the sides and still walk away full.  Terrific ginger margaritas, great service and a salted caramel sundae topped the night.  All very good.  Just make sure the price doesnt give you indigestion.",Good,Good,Good
"Food was excellent.   Decor is dark and comfortable (pretty modern).  Aria is a great location and the food, while straigtforward, its done really well.  Sushi appetizer was delicious.  Waygu beef filet is delicious - and so are the sauces that it came with - especially the miso butter sauce and the habernero sauce!  Its not cheap, but was great for a special occasion dinner when you want to splurge.",Good,Good,
"This is a very upscale and hip establishment. The food is exceptional. There is enough classic preparation mixed with some cutting edge techniques and ideas to make this place a great place to eat!


The atmosphere is very edgy, the decor is modern, but the lighting is very dark inside. This doesn't take away from the experience, but it does make it a little difficult to see. However, lighting around the table make your personal area well lit and able for all to enjoy. 


This is a cant miss locale and if you're looking for a special night out and some outstanding food, then this is the place to go!",Good,Good,
"I really enjoyed the eating experience at this beautiful restaraunt.  The service and beef was outstanding.  Everything was excellent with the exception of the truffle mashed potatoes, they were a little runny.  Full disclosure - the meal was comped, but I would go back if it wasn't.",Good,Good,Good
It was my husband and my 21st anniversary and we were in Vegas with our 17 year old son. We decided to splurge on what we thought would be an amazing meal but were totally dissapointed. We have dines to many fine steakhouses and have no problem blowing some big $$$ on a fine meal but a $52 filet should be heaven...and it was not. It was average. My son's ribeye also average. My $18 shrimp cocktail was yum but 4 prawns?? Come on!!! The best part of the meal was excellent service and a lovely anniversary dessert of molten choc. lava cake and tahitian vanilla bean ice cream. If you want great steak in Vegas for a more reasonable price hit Stack at Mirage or Hugo's Cellar at the 4 Queens. Both 5 star!!,Good,Good,
Great salmon & shrimp cocktail! Presentation is excellent. Filet is just the fight size and seasoned to perfction.  Veggies prepared in olive oil are crisp and refreshing.  This NYC Spica Market inspired location in Vegas is truly representative of it's Manhattan origin. Great decor and smooth lounge music add for an excellent ambience,Good,Good,
"We dined at Jean Georges Steakhouse in Las Vegas with some friends for a 40th birthday. It is a trendy upscale place. We were greeted and, as we had a reservation for 8 we were seated right away. It wasn't overly busy as far a restaurants go on a Saturday night, so I have to say that the rest of the service seemed very slow and poor.
There isn't a huge selection on the menu, but it is ample for the dining experience. What you need to remember when looking at the menu is that it is ALL al a carte. So when you order the $36.00 salmon, which I did and it was very good, but it says served with some sort of sauce and mashed potatoes, it means there is a drizzle of sauce around it and the mashed potatoes are only enough to secure the salmon to the plate....literally!! The sides that you can order are all around the $14 mark. They are good, but not exceptional. 
Drinks are outrageously expensive as well, not unlike everything else in Vegas, but here they seemed really steep. My friend ordered a Bellini which came in a small champagne flute and it was $14/drink that was more like a shot. I ordered a caesar and it was normal size at the same price, but very weak. I couldn't tell if there was alcohol in it at all. 
Our bill came and it was $722.00 for 8 of us, with an EIGHTEEN % tip..... WOW!! I thought 18% was a little over zealous for the service that we got. 
So needless to say, we tried it once and that will be all. Chalk it up to been there, done that. Wouldn't do it again though.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I travel ( eat out) 200 nights a year.  Jean Georges does a great job.   We entertained a a group of 10 and the service/food was great.  I would suggest you explain exactly how you would like your steak cooked ( in my case rare plus).  They have an extensive wine list, most are priced at 3x retail, however there are some deals to be found.  Not your traditional decor, which is a plus in my book.  If your up for $100 a head ( food and beverage) this is a great choice.",Good,Good,
We had a wonderful dinner the other weekend at this restaurant. Loved the wine selection by the glass.  My meal of oysters and butter poached lobster was spot on. The service could not be beat. I loved it.,Good,Good,Good
"My Husband, cousin and I enjoyed a perfect meal here. Yes, PERFECT.  Lobster, Sea Bass and Steak were cooked perfectly, served elegantly and with a designer's eye.  It was the first time I tasted comte fritter and I LOVED it.  The wine list was wonderful and we splurged on two French wines.  No room for dessert, except cappuccino.  It's pricey, but worth every penny.",Good,Good,
"I went here recently for a dinner with clients. Food was so-so, service was terrible (took AGES for each course to arrive) and clumsy. Wines were ok. The ambience is neat..I'd avoid it",,Bad,Bad
"My wife, adult daughter and I had the pleasure of dining at Jean George in Aria at City Center this weekend.  From the moment we entered we realized that this was not going to be the usual high end steakhouse experience.  The menu far outreaches normal steakhouse boundaries, with many creative and interesting dishes.  The decor is elegant, and the tables and seating spacious.  Manager James, Executive Chef Michael, Sommelier Reggie, and our servers Ramon and Nabil all represent one of the finest and most knowledgeable teams I've had the pleasure to meet.  


As for the food we enjoyed-  incredible braised short rib, cripsy sushi, and perhaps the best piece of fish I've ever had.  Flown in overnight fresh from South America, the sea bass was magnificent!   You must also try the bone marrow dish as an appetizer- the bone cut vertically and then roasted for a firmer texture, served with brioch toasta and preserved Meyer lemon gremolata.  Elegantly primal!  


Enjoy!",Good,Good,Good
"Planned for a nice, top of the line meal our last day in Vegas but were sadly disappointed.  The ribeye was extremely fatty, and the chicken had a large portion of dark meat.  One of the steak sauces literally tasted like EasyCheese.  Dessert was no better than something one would get from Ruby Tuesday.  Asparagus was undercooked.  Mashed potatoes were OK... The best part of the whole meal was the butternut squash soup appetizer, but this unfortunately set me up with high expectations and the meal did not meet these at all.  Would definitely expect more, especially since we paid $250.",Bad,Bad,
service was all about the upsell. Steak was mediocre at best.,Bad,,Bad
"I have been to several of the restaurants in Aria.  After dining at Blossom and Julian Serrano, I was expecting great things from Jean Georges.  Overall, it was pretty disappointing.  The steak was ok, but certianly not great.  Rarely do I send anything back, but my medium-rare steak came out brown all the way through... This happened to half of the people at our table.  Normally I would just eat it, but the cheapest steaks on the menu are ~$50!  At this price, they should know how to cook a steak properly.  I will not visit this restaurant agian.  There are certianly better restaurants in Aria and I'm sure better steakhouses at nearby casinos.",Bad,Bad,
"I loved the place so much that I went back a second night in a row.  I was reminded how much the server matters to a meal.  When you're with business colleagues, you expect the service to be top notch, and it was on 10/11, but on 10/12, our server ignored us to enjoy conversation with his coworker instead.


Everyone loved their food though and that matters most.  I got the regular filet the 1st night and the Wagu version the next.  It was totally worth the few extra bucks.  Melt in your mouth goodness.",Good,,Bad
"We dined at Jean George on Oct. 2, 2011 and the food was fabulous as well as the service.  We have been to many fine restaraunts in Vegas and wanted to try something new.  I had the Short ribs which were amazing and my husband had the Filet which was just as great.  There special that night was black truffle mashed potatoes which I was glad we chose.  We did not stay at Aria but would definitely consider after dining there checking out the property.",Good,Good,Good
Had a great dinner while staying at the aria. The short ribs were amazing!!  Definitely a place to check out while in Vegas.,Good,Good,
"We had never been to Jean Georges, however they were one of the restaurants listed for the annual Restaurant Week for Three Square (the food bank). The menu looked fabulous so we went. What an AMAZING culinary delight! We started with the Watermelon Gazpacho (served in a tiny espresso cup) the soup had a bit of heat and was the exact right portion. The Heirloom Tomato salad is brilliant. Served with a basil vinaigrette, feta and arugula. Peach salad with chili...yummy. The two main courses we enjoyed were the Angus 300 NY with Chipotle, spinach and small crisp potato. (wow!!)  and the Soy-Glazed Short Rib Apple-Jalape√±o Pur√©e Rosemary Crumbs. Dessert- definitely the Cracklin' Key Lime Pie. The drink menu is unique, extensive and fabulous...try the Elderflower Cosmo!!!!",Good,,
Go see Boris and Doris at Jean Georges. Was excellent food. These guys really knew their menu and were FRIENDLY. No stuffy rude french waiter. Its the only restraunt i went to in 3 weeks in the states i had to go find the manager and tell him how good it was,Good,,Good
"While the food and service were very good, it was over priced. Ala carte items especially. Someone approached our table as we were dining wanting to take our picture and then sell it to us. Very tacky. I would rather have spent the extra money on slots.",Good,Bad,Good
"We booked through our concierge at our hotel (not the Aria, where the restaurant is located) and she told them we were dining for my wife's birthday.
Atmosphere was great, service was attentive but disorganized. Wife's seafood entree was served first but the steak entrees were delayed by several minutes and then served only lukewarm.
The food was delicious, but not exceptional as one would have assumed from the prices which were very high. And, by the way, no mention by the staff that it was my wife's birhday.",Good,Good,Bad
"If you are looking for a steak with a great glass of wine while in Vegas, try Jean Georges at the Aria Casino and Resort.  Dined there one evening with friends, and we all walked out satisfied and complimenting the chef on one dish or a another.  Try the sea bass and the truffle mashed potatoes, you won't be disappointed.",Good,Good,
"What appeared to be an upscale, service oriented experience turned into a typical meal at Denny's. First, I told the waiter I was missing a fork. He brushed it off as if ""things happen"" and said ok. I had to ask another waiter for a fork AFTER my salad arrived. The hostess sat four loud women next to us when there were plenty of other tables available throughout the restaurant. What is wrong with spreading out the customers? As soon as we finished the meal, the staff cleared the entire table including linen, glasses, and flatware. Then, we were asked if we wanted dessert. The waiter wanted my credit card BEFORE he brought the bill. Something is backwords here. The food was ok; considering the price, much better restaurants are available at City Center.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We have eaten here many times. Often they delight with unusual cuts, such as an import of Australian Wagyu when we were there August 13. This is a MEAT-oriented place with a solid wine list and a sommelier, Kim, who is knowledgeable and charming. He often has offbeat selections that add an element of surprise to the evening! Hip atmosphere, good, solid service, make this one of Las Vegas' Top Ten Steakhouses in a city full with them. Try it!",Good,Good,Good
"Food was excellent. Love the atmosphere. Went with my wife on our 12th wedding anniversary. My steak was perfect, just melted in my mouth. We got there at 6pm on a saturday and by 7pm the place was getting full.",Good,Good,
"Expectations were high considering this restaurant sits in Aria.  However, the cesar salad was made with iceberg lettuce and there was no cesar in the salad.  It was too lemony and too much of a pepper taste.  The salad was huge.  The steak was supposed have been medium, but came as medium well. The green sauce that accompanied the steak overpowered the meat flavor, but the sauce tasted good with the asparagus.  Lewnes in Annapolis, MD and Peter Luger in NYC is sooo much better than this place.",Bad,Bad,
"We enjoyed this restaurant very much.  Service was attentive, food was good, and atmosphere was very nice, and also not too loud.


Steak is cooked on apricot wood so there is a significant char on the outside; but I found the flavor to be quite good without making the entire steak tough.  Since I like char, I liked my steak.  All additions (sides, salads, etc.) are a la carte; I had a creamed corn side with peppers and onions that was delicious.  We also had the Mozzarella Buffaletta (sp?) which was good, and since my husband and I split it the waitress was nice enough to have the chef split it on two plates.


My  husband had a fish dish which was light and very well prepared.  The bread basket had a nice variety and the pretzels were delicious (and should be salty).


I have read the other reviews regarding salt - we are pretty salt-sensitive and did not feel like the dishes were overly salty.


The specials were all $65-$68 each a la carte item, so be prepared with a fat wallet.  We enjoyed our meal very much.",Good,Good,Good
"My Husband and I went to Jean Georges for our 9th anniversary dinner.  We had an awesome steak, and the service was amazing.  Very nice waiter, and knowledgeable, he knew all of the different wines, he new the menu from start to finish and was very attentive.  We both got the fillet and it was one of the best I've ever had.  The waiter also brought out some sauces to go with it, all very good.  Our sides were amazing and came out hot hot hot! Steak was on the salty side, however I like my steak with a lot of flavor and saltiness...but it wasn't too salty.  We had to wait for our table, that was the only thing about it, however we just had a drink in the bar until our table was ready.  Its a nice atmosphere, darker lighting, and comfortable chairs.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant,",Good,Good,Good
"My taste buds were fried after eating here.  Started with salty pretzel bread sticks.  Although it was a nice assortment of breads served.  Caesar salad was good, but of course this kind of salad tends to have more sodium than others.  Miso glazed halibut was sooooo salty!! The texture and doneness was perfect, but too much miso.  Then I mistakenly ordered the baked potato that was covered in.... you guessed it... salt/pepper.  ugh! The lamb chops were also very salty AND it was pure fat!! 3 chops and 3 bites.   Service was mediocre.  Had a new server and she didn't tell us about all the specials.  But I got to hear over and over and over and over as new customers sat down.  So I heard all the stuff she missed with us.  It was too late at that point.   Too many good restaurants in LV  to waste another trip here.  Sorry Jean.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I have eaten in numerous restaurants in Las Vegas over the last ten years. A acquaintance  who lives in Vegas recommend  ,  Jean Georges Steakhouse,  to try .It was outstanding,  the furnishings was soft on the eyes , quite and  able to have a conversation  to someone on the other side of the table  .The restaurant was professionally ran, even the Executive Chef was in the restaurant having dialogue  with the patrons . The food was fresh on all counts even a corked under plate to kept the dishes warm. When you enter the Jean George Stackhouse a bar will be in front, ask for Darrin he is a Master Bartender capable of designing a special drink for your taste.",Good,Good,
"The place is cool dark with a trendy vibe, but the rest was not what I had expected when you think steakhouse.  


When I think steak, i think juicy with flavor.  They have a process there that was so quickly explained by the staff it didn't quite sink in, until I tried to sink my teeth into my steak.  I still don't remember but I think they call it a dry process.  When I cut into the steak it looked the right color(for medium)...but there wasn't a bit of juice that came out.  My friend had a filet mignon, that was medium rare, not a bit of blood/juice came out.  That is not your ""traditional"" steak.  I didn't have a $300 dinner tab, to eat beef jerky.


The staff seemed interested in serving...doing the right thing at the beginning, but became more and more inattentive as the night drug on.  And I mean drug on because it took over an hour after we placed our order to get the food.  Inexcusable service especially on a Monday night.


Finally back to our server.  He spoke in rapid breakneck speed to really make it hard to understand what he was telling us.  I don't think I have crossed over into needing a hearing aid yet, so the one thing I can say to management is tell your servers to slooooow down.  And if they are trying to hock this dry process cooking way of doing steaks, please have them explain it with a disclaimer that ""This is not your normal juicy steak!""


After eating at steakhouses in Vegas for 20 years, this by far was the worst steak I have every had.",Bad,Good,Bad
The food here was fantastic and the staff was great.  A little pricey for what you get and some of the sides were a bit on the salty side.  But overall an excellent experience.,Good,Good,Good
"Superb food, professionally and pleasantly served. Waiters were sophisticated and genial with no arrogance.  I had the 8-ounce filet grilled over a wood fire. Didn't need any of the fussy sauces, didn't need any. Spinach and lobster mashed potatoes were perfect sides. Wine list is excellent. Want it more casual? Have your meal served at the bar. But the ambiance is so good, it's a shame not to make an evening of it in the dining room.",Good,Good,Good
"I had an odd experience at Jean Georges. I loved the atmosphere and the service was fine... the only problem was the food! I had the tasting menu and every course was excellent except... the steak? o_o It was so salty. It was such a shame, since it was perfectly cooked and should have been good. I might go back but if I do I'll mention the problem and specifically ask for less salt on the steak. A strange flaw in a steakhouse...",Bad,Good,Good
"Pricey but really worth it....the filet mignon melted in my mouth.   The ""sides"" were single portion which jacked up the price of things...but overall it was a great experience.",Good,Good,
"I ordered a filet and a caser salad for my meal.  The filet may very well have been the best filet I have ever had.  The b√©arnaise sauce was also fabulous.  The salad was very tasty as well, the salad was nicely chopped and had a nice amount of dressing ‚Äì translation ‚Äì the lettuce was not drowning in the dressing.  Very well done.  The service was also very good; our waiter was fun and attentive and never pushy.  I would absolutely go here again.",Good,Good,Good
"Over the years I have visited just about every major steakhouse in Las Vegas.  My dining experience at Jean Georges ranks highly compared to the others.  Even though I was there solo my waiter was very attentive and informative about the menu.  I started with a nice appetizer of a crab cake with a tangy citrus sauce.  Next three perfectly grilled and succulent lamb chops, best I have had in years.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and the prices not low end, but I'll definitely return again.",Good,Good,Good
"Anniversary dinner at Jean Georges Steakhouse during our trip at to see Aerosmith August 1st, 2010.  Got to say Aerosmith was awesome and so was Jean Georges the next night.  We have eaten at numerous restaurants in numerous cities...this was a terrific atmosphere, unbelievable food and very adequate service.  Turf and surf with felit and lobster was fantastic.  Yellowfin was very good, also.  Expensive as sh...but worth it!",Good,Good,Good
"Just returned from a five day trip to Vegas.  Of the restaurants we had dinner in, Jean Georges was our worst experience.  The decor was simply stunning, even the bathrooms were gorgeous.  The wait staff was excellent.  Unfortunately, the food was not on the same level.  My mother and I both had the Parmesan Crusted Organic Chicken at the recommendation of our waiter.  It was not good, in fact it reminded me of shake-n-bake chicken.  My wife liked her sweet pea soup, but that was the only favorable review on the food.  And while the wait staff took good care of us in most ways, they failed to mention at any point that we would be charged $4.50 for every soda refill we had.  That ended up costing us more than a nice bottle of wine would have.  We ate in much nicer restaurants on this trip, and no other restaurant did that.  They could have at least made sure we were aware of it.",Bad,Bad,Good
"Seemed to be the regular steak fare, with flair in the well prepared and presented appetizers and salads, some excellent options in side dishes (we had mashed potatoes with black French truffles and tasty sauteed spinach), a small but excellent desert item, and a sommelier who was knowledgable and helpful in our picking an excellent moderately priced wine.  Steaks cooked to specification.  Attentive service.",Good,,Good
"Great steakhouse!  Decor is nice, but the food is the star.  We began with salad--baby iceberg with blue cheese dressing for me and tomato/mozzarella for my wife.  Wife has petite fillet--the best she has ever had.  I had NY strip Oscar-style--superb.  Black truffle mashed potatoes were a splurge worth every cent.  


Highly recommend.",Good,Good,
"We are local residents of Las Vegas, entertaining important customers from London tonight.  Upon my arrival with two beautiful woman (my wife and our good friend) awaiting arrival of our guests, we went over to the bar where there were three bar stools open.  When we tried to sit down, a total jerk from the restaurant dressed in a suit (probably a manager which makes it worse) gave us a dirty look and said the seats were taken.  Instead of apologizing that he was saving for one of the hotel gambling guests and treating local customers with respect, this moron instantly alienated us forever.  We felt un-welcome and uncomfortable before we ever sat down.  The only reason we didn't leave was that our clients were coming in to join us.


Everything went down hill from there.  Every round table in the restaurant wobbles.  Upon moving to another table,  the help finally admitted that they had a major problem and that different tables were on order.  So the entire evening, we worked to avoid spilling our wine.  Seriously, it was that bad.


When we sat down, there wasn't one gentlemen at the restaurant that offered to pull the lady's chair out for her.  In other words, there were no gentlemen working at this totally mediocre establishment.  


While our lady friend was at the restroom, the waiter staff delivered her meal and let it sit there getting cold with out a second thought.  Absolutely no clue what descent service is.


When my salad arrived, nobody offered me cracked pepper and there was no pepper or salt on the table.


With the exception of the sommelier (a lovely lady) - the whole place was void of any concept of making the customer feel welcome.  It was all about themselves.


Clueless group.  We'll never go back.


Do yourself a favor and spend some time at some really nice restaurants somewhere else.  Just another restaurant buying the name of a famous chef and hiring fast food cooks.


The City Center and their establishments don't deserve our business.  


This is a steakhouse and the steaks were void of any reasonable flavor.  Shocking considering the sky high prices.",,Bad,Bad
"I took a client to this location (6 total people) because we had wanted to find a good restaurant in City Center.  Since we were all fans of a good steak, we decided on this one.  The food was excellent.  Ordered drinks (kumquat mojito, the cold seafood platter, steaks, sides and dessert.  The banana cake with caramel ice cream was probably one of the best desserts that I have had in Las Vegas.  The steak was also perfectly cooked.  The specialty drink was okay to me, but everyone else in my party seemed to love it.  Service was excellent- they came and attended to us frequently, but definitely not enough to be annoying.  The only two things that was disappointing was that the sommelier poured the wine incorrectly and that the table seemed really unstable.  We had asked to move, but they replied that they were all like that, and that they would be replacing them within the next couple weeks.",Good,Good,Good
"There are so many quality restaurants in Las Vegas.I'm afraid to say Jean-Georges have a very long way to go before they reach a one star rating.


The atmosphere was fine.The wine was outstanding! A great sommelier was the saving grace.He suggested two glasses of a mixed grape white(over four).""Conundrum""at a 15.00 per glass and it matched our starters very well.The calamari was outstanding! Tuna tartare was ok.


So far so good...


We ordered the most divine Casa DR Stephen(217) to have with the steaks.A beautiful red wine!


We selected the porterhouse and the rib eye...both to be done rare.


The mains and sides arrive...the rib eye was stone cold in the centre! I was shocked.I had to send it back...no choice...steak taken away...partner left to wait...steak comes back...it's still cold!!! By this time we were both furious.Our meal was totally ruined.Steak taken away again...


We asked to see the front of house...I think in all my years of dining out at top level this was my first time to really complain.He did in the end comp the food.We paid for the drinks...which was fine...as the wine was great.However,we were disappointed by the lack of a basic cooking skill.The chef should be ashamed of himself.No excuse!


Bill was 276.00 for two.(drinks only)


They are planning on opening in London.I can't wait...they will be devoured by the critics if they can't even cook a steak.",Bad,Good,
"We had an awful experience this past week when dining here.  The waitress and manager seemed to have an attitude right from the start.  There were four in our group and we asked for separate checks when we were seated.  Our waitress seemed flustered by this.  We also let them know our show started @ 7:00.  We arrived @ 5:30......'No problem' was what we were told. 
  The lobster bisque @ $18 was bland and what lobster there was tasted like over cooked cod.  The caesar salad wasn't much better.  The lettuce looked like it had been sitting for days and was also lacking in any flavor what-so-ever.  The sea bass was small and ditto once again on flavor.  The salmon was the best dish @ our table.
  After asking twice for the check, they finally arrived 20 minutes later and  3 of the 4 were incorrect.  That took an additional 10 minutes to straighten out.  We reminded our waitress about the show and she nor the manager seemed to care much @ this point.  It looked like there was more staff than patrons........Needless to say we were 15 minutes late to the show!
  Don't bother with this restaurant as it's a waste of time and money.......A BIG thumbs down!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I was among a group of 4 that ate at Jean Georges Steakhouse on Super Bowl Sunday after the game.  In general, everything about the restaurant is first class from the time you step into the restaurant until the time that you leave.  The service, the d√©cor, the food, the ambience, and the dining experience provided to the guest at Jean Georges is exactly what I look for in a great restaurant.


Cocktails:


Being that it was Super Bowl Sunday we had been going at it pretty hard so we settled for just one drink apiece with the selections being Bodingtons (2), Delirium, and a Crown on the rocks.


The Food:


Appetizers:


Calamari
Hamashi
Veal Sweetbreads ‚Äì I have never had sweetbreads before.  Once you get over the unappealing texture the actual taste is actually quite good.
Bread ‚Äì the bread that is served with every table is quite delicious and several different types/flavors are made available


Main Course (or the meat course as we called it):


12oz Filet ‚Äì cooked a perfect medium rare with a great crust on the outside preserving the flavor and the juices
18oz Ribeye (2) ‚Äì they looked like something from the Flintstones but there was not a bite left of either
10oz NY Strip ‚Äì no complaints at all from the diner of this
All meat courses are served with a potpourri of sauces to choose from and sample.  They are; 3 pepper marmalade (my favorite), soy-miso butter (too salty for meat), b√©arnaise, hot mustard, and smoked chili glaze (my second favorite)


Sides:
Trumpet Mushrooms ‚Äì I did not try these as I was still on mushroom overload from the night before at Olive‚Äôs but the table enjoyed.
Grilled Asparagus ‚Äì my favorite of the sides served with lemon zest for refreshing flavor combination.
Bone Marrow ‚ÄúBroiled‚Äù 


Service:


I am not sure that I have ever received better service in a restaurant.  It could be that it was the place was brand new and they were trying to impress or that the restaurant was about 1/4 because of the game and the economy.  Whatever the case, the information provided to us, as the diners, was great.  All our questions about the menu were answered and the waiter/servers were very friendly in regular conversation as well.


Bathrooms:


Normally, who cares about the bathrooms as long as they serve their function.  These bathrooms however have a very unique layout and was just another good aspect of the experience that provided even more to talk about.


D√©cor:


The dining area is dark with dark wood, browns, and deep oranges.  To me, great d√©cor for a steakhouse.  Good almost circular dining area with 1/2 booth/tables on the outside and full tables on the inside. The staff explained to me what the design that was on the walls and menus was supposed to be, but I could never really see it.  Others at the table could.  There are appears to be a couple private dining rooms that would be perfect for a bachelor party or larger gathering of people.  


Overall:


To me, Jean Georges is the highest quality of dining experience that I have experienced in Las Vegas.  The price is not cheap but it is not overly expensive compared to other similar quality restaurants in Las Vegas.  I will, and have, recommend it to others visiting the city and that are looking to have a top rate food experience.",Good,Good,Good
"Only dinner reservation i made during my stay to Texas (16 days).  Advised the waitress I wanted the lava cake when I sat down and again when I ordered.  I ordered 2 starters rather than a starter and main due to size. The batter shrimp were good.  when my plate was cleared I requested the chocolate lava cake for desert and was advised that it takes 25 minutes.  best part of an hour later it arrived and it was solid,  no liquid chocolate lava centre.  i pointed this out to the waitress and she said she would get another one but by this time i did not want to wait any longer and i left.  she spoke to the manager and he too it off of my bill.  Sad he did not come over himself at this time, but i did briefly interact with him when i was waiting at the elevator and he said it was a new recipe and took 35 minutes and i could have another one to take back to my hotel.  I declined and by this time this shipped had sailed.  very disappointed for the famous restaurant in SA and the signature desert.  Especially as i have booked moths in advanced and advised the waitress this was my main reason for coming.  hopefully things will improve for other people",Bad,Bad,Bad
My daughter has always wanted to dine here since she was younger we would pass thru the years while visiting San Antonio it was a dream of hers. When she moved to San Antonio to attend UTSA I made her and her boyfriend who was visiting from her local city a reservation and the server was so rude and inattentive I am assuming because they are young I have always taught her to be kind and always tip very very well to your servers due to I myself being in the service industry. Yes I was on facetime because she wanted to share the experience since I am four hours away. I guess the profiling is real in some areas I am so upset he ruined that experience for her. Please do better and be kind you never know who‚Äôs dreams you are crushing she was kinda embarrassed that maybe she was not good enough to dine there. Besides that the food she said was great and view amazing.,Good,Good,Bad
"This SHOULD be a good place. It‚Äôs a revolving, fine food destination after all. But it wasn‚Äôt a Good at all. Booked a reservation for dinner one month prior. Particularly asked in the reservation for a table for 4 at the window for the kids to enjoy more and be able to see the downtown area since that is where we‚Äôre staying. At the time of arrival at the base of the tower it took the hostess forever to find the reservation. Then she volunteered to tell us to be sure and tell our server that we wanted to go up to the observation deck after dinner so they would give us a wristband to do so without having to pay extra.
Next was the server. VERY sweet girl but had way too many tables. Brought us the wrong drink for our teenage grandson. I asked for a glass of ice which took a full 35 min to get. We sat between courses with a LONG wait for dirty dishes to be collected. About the time we thought we should be getting our main meal the server came BACK to the table to go over our order with us! She hadn‚Äôt placed it yet! 
We waited and waited and waited when we needed anything. Drink refills weren‚Äôt ever offered. When we were finally done we asked for the wristband or a pass to go up to the observation deck. She said they close in 20 minutes and it‚Äôll be $12 extra per person!
Restrooms were out of toilet paper. Trash was on the floor. Very poorly managed. But the food itself was excellent. Can‚Äôt recommend it to anyone which is so unfortunate since it‚Äôs such a landmark and has Good! Cost us over $375.00 for dinner. Only $22 of that was for two glasses of wine. The rest was food. Very sad.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Went to celebrate my fifth anniversary, but probably the last time I‚Äôll go for a special kind of event. Our waiter was barely audible even though there wasn‚Äôt many people and no music. We were sat in front of a booth where a family was two feet away and facing us. I wouldn‚Äôt have minded if it was packed, but there were so many open spaces! I also wouldn‚Äôt be bothered if it was just a random date lol. 


After asking to move to a more intimate and less awkward area (literally one table down) we were told no :/


The food was good but not worth the experience. We also got our water one hour into us sitting down and being greeted (but by another waiter).",Good,Bad,Bad
"3 people 2 glasses of wine 1 lava cake, $250 for lunch.  You get a piece of fish or meat and a serving of potato. No bread, no salad, no vegetable. The food was good, as well it should be for that much. Butvery disappointed.


My general rule is never pay a lot of money to eat when the food is not the main attraction.",Good,Bad,Bad
This place was a highlight of my trip‚Ä¶10 years ago. Hoping to relive that great experience this week and was left dissatisfied. I came for happy hour and the girl at the reception desk on the ground level told me that kids can not go in there for happy hour. She made a call and found that we could sit in the restaurant and go up the stairs to get the bar/happy hour. Then she put us on a 30 minute wait. We patiently waited for our time to be called and were taken to the top. Upon being sat at the restaurant I was informed that the waitress was unhappy with the decision to sit us there. It was not ideal for us either but we understood the situation. A few minutes after being sat we had the manager come and reiterate what we were already told. It was pretty rude to bother us at this point and educate us on the policy. Perhaps he should have spent that time educating his own staff about their policy so they didn‚Äôt waste my time waiting. I don‚Äôt understand his point of complaining to us after we had already ordered. The restaurant was essentially empty so we weren‚Äôt taking up a table. It‚Äôs not worth it anyway because they used poor quality ingredients in my flat gin and tonic and the wine was also a cheap bottle. I used to recommend this to everyone but what a turn off.,Bad,Bad,Bad
Only 1 elevator working!!!!  Waited 40 plus minutes each way.  Food and service was decent.  You have been warned.   I felt bad for the servers that took the blunt of everyone frustration.,,Bad,
"Disappointing celebration‚Ä¶ I took a friend, new to San Antonio, I‚Äôve been here many time‚Ä¶soup was cold, steaks were not prepared to order‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm feeding the shrimp to my chickens. We ordered coffee, never got it‚Ä¶ but hey, they comped one dessert üòï
Overall, unimpressive tonight",Bad,Bad,
"Beyond the terrific city views, you can expect a lack luster experience wrapped up in empty promises. The service was mediocre taking 90min to get our first course. The food is average quality with overly pretentious plating.  


The decor is dated and doesn‚Äôt give you any sense of this being a clean place - stained walls & dirty utensils. The manager stood at the front of the restaurant on his phone our entire visit and not once asked ‚Äúhow was your visit‚Äù. The place is so cold, the hostesses sit on a heater behind the counter. 


After reading this,  should you still want to attempt a meal, also be advised of the $20 to park, a long walk from the parking lot that is not  safe for anyone with walking challenges, and slow elevators controlled by ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt care less‚Äù attendants. The shaking and squealing pipes in the restrooms is just par for the course here.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Very Poor Quality Food and Poor Service for Dinner. Entrees and Side Dishes were poorly prepared and poorly presented on the plate. The food portions were extremely small, and the flavor of the food was very bland due to the lack of any seasoning. The service was extremely slow, taking about 2 hours after ordering to receive & finish our meals, even though the restaurant was not overly busy. Overall a very big disappointment and I won‚Äôt eat there again!  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend  anyone spent their hard earned money to eat at the Chart House Restaurant until vast improvements are made in food quality and service. I give the restaurant a one star rating.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Everything is ok about this place EXCEPT the food.  
Unreal.  


What kind of monster runs this place and serves such Bad at such insanely high prices.  The owners don't care, just trying to make a buck.  There's no way that restaurant lasts anywhere else except in the exclusive location.  
Don't go.  If you care about San Antonio, don't go.


Tower Of Americas should be the best restaurant in the city but dollar for dollar I think it is the absolute worst.  You won't eat much worse food than you do there.",Bad,,
"The manager on duty tried to insinuate that I ate half the steak and complained to take it off the bill.  I assured him that the stake was salted and that I could pay for the meal. His behavior was accusatory, beligerante, condescending, and ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE!",,Bad,Bad
After coming here for my first time I will never be returning. I came for a late lunch at 2pm to find out they started their dinner menu at that time. I then tried ordering prime rib to be told that they do not serve that before 4pm. My filet came out extremely rare after ordering medium. I sent back and it came out well done and the meat was cheap as could be. The mashed potatoes came out cold as well. The pasta had no sauce on it and no seasoning on the shrimp. The salad was soggy. Don‚Äôt recommend. The chefs are not chefs it seems like they just came yesterday and learned to cook a steak today.,Bad,Bad,
Train your employees on timing of service and to be knowledgeable about the menu.  A disappointing evening made worse by the food delivered not matching the menu.,,Bad,Bad
"uite literally the worst dining experience for our special occasion where we paid in advance for a pre-set menu on July 22nd. I would give this 0 stars if I could. Spoke with the manager that evening about how horrible everything was. He said there was nothing he could do, we would have to go through their Events and Accounting departments to rectify the situation. I contacted both the event manager and the accounting contact per the manager's recommendation and to this date, I still have not had a conversation with them. I was asked for our contact info on July 28th and have not received a single phone call from them. I have sent multiple follow up emails with no response.


Thank you Landry's and Chart House for confirming that our experience is of no concern to you since it was paid for in advance. This was a once in a lifetime occasion for my father and because it was so terrible, I wanted to take care of the tab so he wouldn't have to pay for such an awful experience on the biggest day of his life. As the manager on duty stated, he could do nothing about the tab and situation at hand simply because it was taken care of in their corporate office. To start, an apology would have gone a long way. Instead, we just got pawned off. But I can't even get their office to call me back. I've included a photo of my email with the full detail of our poor experience as it's too long to include in this review.


10 out of 10 do not recommend, especially if you've prepaid for your meal. You are simply guaranteeing poor quality in every aspect possible.",,Bad,Bad
"We‚Äôve eaten at the Chart House in Las Vegas. There‚Äôs zero comparison. My $105 lobster was rubber on the edge requiring a steak knife and the center was raw. The rice pilaf was awful!! The lava cake had no lava. The outside was over cooked. No ‚Äúlava‚Äù in the center. My husbands quail was burnt to a crisp. I only gave this 2 stars because our server tried so hard to keep up.


In addition the ladies room was DISGUSTING!! I‚Äôve been in interstate truck stops that were cleaner than this place.",Bad,Bad,
The view is great and that is what you‚Äôre paying for. If this was down on the ground it would be a mediocre to poor restaurant.  The clam chowder was good but my $60 steak was overcooked and the mashed potatoes were just above room temperature. The waitress was friendly but disappeared for extended times. Our drinks ran down several times. Our food took quite a while to arrive.  As we were leaving a customer was complaining that their order was completely lost.,Bad,Good,Bad
"Horrible!  We had reservations at 8:15pm.  The restaurant was not busy - tables were open and not full.  We still had to wait for a table.  It was HOT!!!! All night.  We complained and our waitress said it‚Äôs never cool in there - ever.  We‚Äôve dined several times there for special occasions, never hot before!  We were miserable.  We would of shared another bottle of wine, but it was too hot!!  Our waitress was slowwwwww!  Once we ordered our wine, we didn‚Äôt get our wine for over 20 minutes!  Then, we ordered our entrees, it took over 45 minutes to receive it!  We kept drinking water because it was so hot, and our waitress didn‚Äôt come around too often to refill!  Our food was okay, nothing worth $400 for our table - totally not worth that.  Our waitress gave us our ticket, and my husband gave his card to her so we can rush to get out of there due to the heat, and it took over 15 minutes for her to return to give him the check to sign!  She was horrible!!  We use to go to Chart House for special occasions, but never again!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Went to dinner with wife for mother's day and my birthday. It should have been a memorable night as usual, but not this time. We have been here many times over the years, and I hate writing this, but they have left me no choice because they apparently don't care if they get you sick or not. The service was very slow, but that wasn't the worst of it. They were serving dinner on dirty plates. I complained about the issue, but never saw management. Another waiter was setting up another table before we left, and I asked him to check the plates. They too were dirty plates. I asked again to see management, but apparently they didn't care enough to address the issue or confront me. We barely ate the dinner itself, and took most of it home. We finished the dinner last night and my wife was having diarrhea this morning, and my stool was very soft. It seems to be a simple issue with the dishwasher, but they don't seem to care enough if they get people sick or not. This will not be one of my restaurant choices any more, and I'm also a Landry Club Member.",Bad,Bad,
"DINER BEWARE! This place has gone downhill and is NOT a recommendation. First of all, the city owns the parking lot and now it will cost you $20.00 to park just to have a crappy meal. Secondly, as you can see from the pics I've posted, the food was floating in grease, the place was dirty including the stained tablecloth on our table that was quite visible and the dead bugs on the window seal that we got to enjoy every 360 degrees so you know that the staff doesn't care. Thirdly, there was water from the recent storm dripping down the window on the inside - things that make you go Hmmmm when you're 750 ft up in the air. Thirdly, they were out of Bruschetta and when I ordered one of their signature drinks - they don't even make that drink any more - very sad to have gone here for a mother's day experience! Lastly, I provided a pic of the paper napkins provided because I was wearing white and I didn't want black lint from their black cloth napkins - really! How expensive would it be to have a few white cloth napkins??? We are Landry's members and Landry's needs to cut bait from this establishment! We will NEVER be back - too many other dining experiences. I get that the view is the main experience but just beware - you now have to pay additionally to go on the observation deck...used to be free with your dining receipt.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Went here on the last night of our holiday.  The venue and view is amazing but this did not make up for the food which was pretty average.  My husband and I chose the Fire Grilled Mojo Shrimp to share.  This was ok actually, but you are only served 5 shrimps on a sharing plate which is an odd number for two people.  6 would have been much better.  My husband chose the Filet Mignon which he said was good.  I chose the Grilled Ancho Sea Bass which was served on top of wok fried vegetables in a lemon garlic broth with peppadew pine nut salsa and it was so bland. Couldn't taste any lemon or garlic and I thought with it being a broth there would be more liquid but there wasn't much at all.  It also lacked seasoning in my opinion.  The service was quite slow but our waiter was pretty good.  Thanks Scott!  Obviously an amazing venue and we were there at sunset so it was spectacular however in my opinion the food was not up to scratch considering the cost.",Bad,Good,Good
"Traveling for business, I brought my mother and daughter along. When I needed my reservation changed, I called multiple times and no one answered. They labeled us a no show and said I would have to be in the waitlist; I disagreed. After paying $20 to park and making attempts to contact someone, I was not leaving. Ultimately, we were allowed up and seated. Our waitress did review any specials or offer bread for the table. We had lemonade and tea and had to ask for straws, sugars, handkerchiefs. The food was delicious. Considering the establishment is supposed to be higher priced and higher services, I was disappointed. When I asked about bread that I saw on other tables and the basket in her hand, she said oh you have to ask. While we awaited our server for the bill, we saw on multiple occasions other wait staff detailing specials, the history of the restaurant and the city, and other services. When my mother asked about desserts, she went and got a menu and then said the lava cake (their signature dessert) would take some time. So, I asked: when didn‚Äôt you offer it earlier. She was apologetic but explained this away by saying she was busy and did not know we wanted anything. She asked if I wanted to speak to the manager, who promptly came. He understood and apologized saying we dropped the ball. He reduced the bill and again apologized. For us, it was not about the bill and only about the service.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Went for anniversary dinner. Came from out of town.
View was great seating was nice
 It was a little chilly in the restaurant 
Food arrived cold 
Ordered a herb crusted ribeye, it was not herb crusted 
Ordered two dinner entrees, waitress then asked if we would like a soup or salad  which we both ordered 
 The way the waitress asked, we were under the assumption it was included with dinner entree which it was not, it was an additional $$$ for food we really didn‚Äôt want. Ordered the lava cake. Cake was falling apart. Almost like an icecream sundae. Waitress was aware, laughed, and still served it. For the price you pay you‚Äôd expect a much better quality of food. There was no quality control. Would recommend for the view and atmosphere but it ends there. the food left much to be desired. There IS MUCH better food on the river walk that‚Äôs better priced and provide better service",Bad,Good,Bad
"We went here because it was really the closest place to eat when we were in the area. We did the platform tour (waste of $$ IMO), so we wanted to grab a bite while we were there for lunch, first the girl in the elevator asked if we had reservations, we were like no, (this was like 1130am) then she said well you can eat in the bar they have the same menu. We got there and looked down in the restaurant and it was empty so I went and asked if we could eat there and they were like yes. They do not have a lunch menu which is something they should have if open during that time -the other menu food was really heavy. So we all ended up order appetizers for our lunch, I had the crab cakes, 2 others had coconut shrimp and the other the chowder.  Very little servings for what they cost. Drinks were not good, my wine was warm (i had a white). Not impressed and I was starving the rest of the day until dinner. I have been to Chart House restaurants before and they are usually really good, this one not so much. I wouldn't waste the money. It is also very dated, the window seals were broken in a lot of the places (you see a lot since it is rotating).",Bad,Bad,
"Well, it is a revolving restaurant at the top of a tourist tower, so was pretty much what we expected. 
First of all our server was great - I believe her name was Ray (Rae?). The following was not her fault:
My wife ordered lobster bisque - flavor was ok, lots of lobster BUT was luke warm at best. Sent it back. New bowl arrived with her entree. Was no warmer. 
We both ordered prime rib, both enjoyed the actual cut of meat, but both plates, including the prime rib and the sides, were again luke warm at best.
A disappointing meal, but the view is really what you are there for, right?  And the view is spectacular.",Bad,Good,
Not Chart House food quality.  The only thing going for this place is the location and fact that it's one of the last rotation restaurants in the country.   As for a Chart House the cheif should be fired.  Look at the photos.  Do you know anything about plateing?  The juice should not be dried runs all over the plate.  The prime rib is better at Arby's.  I mean it wasn't even a choice cut.  I'm a butcher and know the difference.   It was a 1/4 inch thick piece more like arm roast.  I think you microwaved it after you plated it.   Even my sword fish had dried juice run all over the plate.   The drinks were watered down.   There is no reason to skimp on alcohol when the drink is $15 -17 a piece.   To top it off you have to pay $10 for parking and it was 7pm.  Parking should be included with dinner,Bad,Bad,
"Had a Bad, server needs more training. Medium rare steak came out blue rare, when I sent it back it returned medium well. This, and a crappy lounge singer, simply ruined what I had hoped would be a special anniversary dinner experience.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had a great time celebrating mine and my sister's birthday yesterday. Food great except for the Fried Calamari. We were enjoying it until we pulled a piece out with what looked like a pubic hair, or hair from a beard wrapped around it. Walked out of there to go and enjoy the River Walk and find a place to vomit. Other than that, we had a good time. LOL
Sucks that we had that food experience for our very first visit to the Tower of the Americas.
The waitress was awesome though and no way was it on her.",Good,Bad,Good
"Ten years ago I wrote a review of the Chart House - and I should just cut and paste it here.  First off - the tourist part of going there was fantastic - the rotating view of San Antonio is incredible!  But.  And when I said in the title I am a glutton for punishment it's because we have gone to the Chart House many times over the years - and it's pretty much always the same - bad.  BUT we had our wedding dinner there (before it was the Chart House) so we have gone back for sentimental reasons - the time before this for our 40th and last month for our 50th.  My family contacted the Chart House to try and have something special set up - they said no to everything.  They did wish us a Happy Anniversary every chance they got tho.  We both ordered the prime rib that comes with a scoop of garlic mashed potatoes.  No bread, no salad, no nothing unless you pay extra above the $40+ for the 10/12oz piece of meat.  Both our dinners were cool - the only thing that was close to being warm was the ""Jus.""  The prime rib was so rare (and we like them medium rare or rare) they wouldn't cut - even with the large steak knives they gave us.  The stringy gristle didn't help.  We paid extra for a salad (for her) and some asparagus to share that was good.  We had coffee and cheesecake for desert - and even the coffee was cool.  We each had a couple of $13 cocktails and they were very good.  Overall great service, great view - but check it out after you've gone somewhere else to eat!",Bad,Good,Good
"I ordered a tuna steak. When it arrived over an hour later, I knew by looking at it that it was a bad cut. Instead of it being cut with a vertical grain, it was cut so that the steak was in horizontal slabs. There were membranes running all through it making it impossible to cut. The vegetables served with it were cold. When I told the server about it, she said she could ask the kitchen to cook a new one, but it would probably be over an hour before it would be ready. I just had her take it off the bill and I didn‚Äôt eat anything. A wasted evening.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This was our third trip to the tower for our anniversary dinner.  What a difference a few years make!  The place looked like a ghost town.  Missing ingredients necessary for drinks.  A piece of fish that was so bland it was without taste.  The best part about the visit was the view (and that was mediocre, at best).  For the money that was dropped for dinner for two, I felt cheated.  I think I'm done with this place.",Bad,Bad,
"We arrived within five minutes of our reservation time at 4:45, but were asked to wait almost 20 minutes before being seated. We ordered a bottle of wine and then waited almost 15 minutes for our server to inform us they didn't have it. No problem, we ordered a different bottle. The new bottle of white arrived and it was just above luke warm. A bucket of ice was offered, so we accepted the bottle. The watermelon carpaccio was delicious as was my wife's chicken entr√©e. My swordfish was overcooked, but whatever, it's our anniversary so we move on without complaint. We then order the lava cake and a bottle of Prosecco. Our server dissappears for 15 minutes, so we ask another server to tell her we're thirsty. She finally shows up only to tell us the bar is backed up. (We ordered a bottle, not a pina colada). At this point we're ready to go, so I politely ask for the check. Another 10 minutes go by and our server shows up with the bottle of Prosecco. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è We politely decline and ask again for the check, which she has on her. However, it still has the (never recieved) dessert and Prosecco on it. I ask her to remove those two charges. Another 10 minutes goes by, in the meantime the manager comes over and makes a bunch of excuses for their poor performance. At this point we've been sitting over 30 minutes with empty glasses ü•Ç. Final verdict: it you want mediocre service, just above average food, and a great view at above market prices... this is your place. However if you want quality service and food, there are much better options in the great city of San Antonio.",Good,Bad,Bad

"Fathers Day celebration at Chart House was terrible.


Ordered from a preset menu. After the first course was served we were told the main dish (prime rib) is not available until after a certain time. We are asked to pick the only meat option of ribeye at an additional price.


At the time of this back and forth the manager was overheard asking the waiter if we knew the difference between ‚Äúprime rib and ribeye‚Äù.


During which time, my father chews on a piece of glass in his salad. 


The restaurant was very dirty with stains on many of the windows and trash left on the ledge for everyone to see.


The experience was very poor and the managers handling of the situation was very disappointing. I don‚Äôt believe we will be back for awhile.",Bad,Bad,
"I will start with - there was glass in a salad. 


After we ordered the 3 course we were told they don‚Äôt serve rib eye til after 4. I don‚Äôt eat fish so no other option except paying extra for prime rib. When we reminded them that wasn‚Äôt our fault I over heard the manager say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt they know the difference between prime rib and ribeye?‚Äù
That was when I had walked over to tell them my father in law chewed on glass.


Their solution- Give him his meal at no charge and follow up in a couple of weeks to be sure he is ok.


While spinning you also can see all the gross items and notes people leave that nobody cleans up on the ledge. The ledge is inside and by you. The grossest was the eye lashes (pic included)


Views are great.",Bad,Good,
"To start, you‚Äôre paying $15 to park and your parking is not validated. The decor is outdated and feels a little like a cruise ship. We did have a nice seat by the window and watched the sunset which was beautiful. Our appetizer of hummus was just average so try another selection if you‚Äôre wanting an appetizer. I ordered the Thai shrimp with cabbage and rice. Requested essentially a double portion of cabbage coleslaw in lieu of rice but instead just received my plate sans rice which made for a small portion given there were only 5 shrimp for $28. Other 2 friends ordered filet mignon which they both liked. Worth mentioning is the fact that they ran out of potatoes and substituted couscous without asking for a preference. For a $40 meal it seems they should ask you what you‚Äôd like if they run out of what‚Äôs ordered. Other friend substituted asparagus for the potatoes for a $6 up charge. It was a beautiful view and glad we went but probably one of those things that‚Äôs now checked off the list.",Bad,Good,
"Horrible,  not worth it. Won't eat in a rotating restaurant again. Everyone in the elevator complained also.",,Bad,
"When you catch the girl with the long braids rolling her eyes and sneering behind customer‚Äôs backs it is just a turn off. If they hate customers, what are they doing to the food? The hostess was also very young, unapologetic, and cold like the food. 
The restaurant was completely empty and she made us wait an hour for a table even though we called ahead and they told us there was no wait. There were literally 5 tables occupied in the whole place, the rest were empty. Also, while the staff with no smiles stand around doing nothing and rolling their eyes at customers, there are dirty fingerprints everywhere. If they can‚Äôt be bothered to keep the entrance clean, I‚Äôd hate to see the kitchen! 
Go for the view and the observation  deck but skip this restaurant. They hate people and it shows.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I‚Äôll start with the good. Given the restaurant is 750 ft in the air the views of San Antonio are spectacular. And with the restaurant being revolving, you get to see the whole lot. Sunset is spectacular. In addition, our waitress was lovely and provided the best service she could.
Now the bad. The first welcome to the restaurant when checking in (having taken the long lift!) was from a clearly
miserable girl who didn‚Äôt even make eye contact when checking our reservation. We then sat in the waiting area, which is very pleasant. We were taken to our seats by the waitress who was lovely. We ordered - then it all went wrong. Our main courses came out before our starters. We then advised the senior male member of staff who had delivered it but our waitress was clearly sent back to ensure we took it. She then got our starters so we had starters and mains in the table at the same time. This would not have been a problem had the food been good. It was anything but. Cold, flavorless, and probably the worst food we‚Äôve had at any restaurant.  Slimey cold ‚Äòsea bass‚Äô with no seasoning, hard undercooked fingerling potatoes and broccoli, cold limp chicken and over-sugared dessert.  
If you want nice views then chart House is great. If you want Good then do not go.",Bad,Good,Bad
"4 people for lunch on a Sunday. Food arrived 45 minutes after ordering. My chicken sandwich had the chicken only cover half the bun. Imagine eating half a sandwich with only bun, lettuce and tomato with no meat. Manager agreed that it was bad and didn't charge us (only after I asked). Others food was good. This place is great for the views, but we found the service and food to be fair-good at best. At lunchtime they gave us 4 dinner menus ($$$) and ONE lunch menu to share. I'd go once for the view but not return.",Bad,Good,Bad
"NONE, not only the Bad, service, sitting, dIrty place, dirty windows we had to put up with, but also with the waitress helper telling me there was no more bread at the gourmet restaurant, but having deal with an upset wife who they ruined her anniversary date.... no, I do not recommend this place at all. i have a feeling it would've been better if i took her to have some pozole at the Mexican place we love to visit every time we visit san Antonio if I only knew.


just look out the glass windows to see how many germs you can find...this is in the inside not the outside, which would be a little bit more understood due to the height...‚Ä¶ this is in the inside  where you are going to be sited to eat your food.....pray you don't get one of those prison booths in the corner with an 120 year old sit that is the height of my cat.


I will never visit this place again ever, even if they pay for it.


NO I WOULD CERTAINLY NOT recommend this place at all, period.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Crappie experience :(( wish we had chosen a better place to celebrate our special occasion. We primarily went here for the fine dining & unique experience but it was totally worthless for the few hundred dollars we paid. The staff were so rude & our waiter was totally preoccupied and made us feel as if he was doing us a favor. Service was very very slow..Thankfully food was ok, the view was good but nothing more than that!!! Would never come back or recommend to a friend.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We came for drinks during happy hour and dinner.The prime rib was again wonderful (we've been to other Chart House locations). Erica, our server, was excellent. The band was also very good.
The downside - and it was a major negative - was the freezing temperature inside the restaurant. Freezing!  We mentioned it. Other people mentioned it. And, nearly every person in the restaurant kept their jackets on throughout dinner.  
It's not good having the restaurant so cold as some members of our party were freezing and others complained the room temp made their food cold very quickly.",Good,Bad,Good
"Had NYE dinner and was probably one of the worst meals I have experienced. The bread was good. Crab legs frozen, steak undercooked, lava cake cold. Waiter was very nice.",Bad,Bad,Good
I have never felt so ripped off in my life Been to the Chart House several times over the holidays in several different cities Never did I receive such poor quality as in the Tower of America We ordered the Shrimp beignets The came out like fried raw pancake batter We had early reservations and the spinach salad was sold out My happy husband order the lamb when it came out the portion were so small he was not sure if there was an meat on the plate I ordered surf and turf I got a large plate with 3 tiny shrimp that were over cooked like rubber the shell was stuck to the shrimp had a very hard time pellet it off The potatoes and steak were cold The Chart Hope se can not use the excuse of Covid since  it appeared they were fully staffed Thank you for ruining my Christmas and stealing from your customers What a disappointing evening,Bad,Bad,
"It was incredibly warm when we were seated.  They adjusted the temperature but by then one of our group had motion sickness.   Very slow service.  They did not listen to request for  soup as an entree.  Did not bring bread despite request when soup came back with entrees,  Run over by staff trying to go to the ladies restroom,.  When arrived  restroom needed service.  overall quite disappointed for a birthday celebration dinner.",,Bad,Bad
"Beautiful view, but the slowest service I have ever experienced. It takes 45 minutes for a full rotation, it also took 45 minutes to get our drinks.  The food took almost 2 hours to arrive at our table.  Our waiter was very polite and professional, but the dinner took over 3 hours. We will not be returning.",,Bad,Bad
"First of all, the food was wonderful, and the service was over the top.  The problem ‚Ä¶ the ‚Äúmusic‚Äù.  Some guy screaming into the mic.  Entirely too loud for a good evening.

"Horrible experience. We are Landrys members and everytime we visit any Landrys restaurant, they always make sure we are taken care of. I even remember going to a Bubba Gumps in Orlando when they were no longer taking any more names but we showed them our Landrys card and we were brought right in with no wait. I was told I would be put on top of a 3 hour waiting list even though I am a Landrys member. I even asked the hostess to explain how does that work since we are Landrys Card members, and we always visit Landrys restaurants any where we travel, all she could say is they would put us to the top of a 3 hour waiting list. I asked if I can come back tomorrow and she said they were completely booked tomorrow and it would be the same process. Not even because we are Landrys members was she going to even attempt to assist us. Horrible experience and will be contacting Landrys corporate about our experience. We went to Rainforest down the street, they had a 2 hour wait but we showed our Landrys card and they let us right in. Our first visit to San Antonio and highly disappointed in this place.",,Bad,Bad
"We visited San Antonio from Dallas last week.  We thought we would have a nice lunch at the Chart House... What a mistake!!! 
 First, they made us wait almost 1 hour before getting a table (and the restaurant had plenty of empty tables when they called us in). 
Once seated, we waited over 20 minutes for our waiter to show up...   We asked for drinks and water; we had the drinks about 20 minutes later, the water never arrived...  We ordered food, and waited over 90 minutes to get served.   However, we couldn't eat anything....   Our hamburgers were black, totally burned, hard like a stone, cold and poorly presented.   For the price, we were expecting something a little bit ""fancy"".   The soups were served completely cold as well.  WTF?   We decided to leave this place at that time...  


In short, stay away from this place. Their food and service are terrible. 


Other customers got there after us and got served before us... I don't know if they enjoyed their micro-waved reheated food or not...  It was obvious we were tourists, while most other customers were wearing suits or fancy clothing (were probably locals), but it is NOT a reason to treat us the way we got treated!  


I guess the management just doesn't care if you are a visiting family and won't come back there.


Anyhow, it was the WORST lunch ever. We had to leave without eating anything (but they still billed us, and they are over-priced!), just wasted over three hours of our precious time there for nothing!!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We showed up at the Chart House on a weekday at 1155.  We waited until 1250 to get a table.  We never got our water, ordered and waited until 1415 (2:15 PM!) to finally be served, and our soup was cold, our burgers were totally burned and hard like a stone.  Food and service were terrible.   Other locals got there after us and got served before us...   It was obvious we were tourists, since we were all dressed relax, while most other customers were wearing suits or fancy clothing.  I guess the management just doesn't care if you are a tourist family and won't become regular.  WORST lunch ever.  We had to leave without eating anything (but they still billed us, and they are over-priced!), just wasted almost 3 hours of our time there for nothing!!!   (PS: only good thing is the view...)",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I would give this review 0 starts if I could. Went to celebrate our son‚Äôs 21st bday. Never In my life have I tasted food this terrible at a restaurant. Service was beyond slow. After 45 min I asked if Complementarybread was served here. To my surprise she said yes, (Surprised because I figured it wasn‚Äôt an option since we hadn‚Äôt gotten any) I asked could we have some?? My 19 yr old  took a bite of his lobster and said it tasted microwaved, stale and cold. I thought he was exaggerating so I tasted it. I IMMEDIATELY took it out of my mouth and told him not to eat it. Those people should be shut down. Ice cold and tasted like it had been sitting out since that morning. My husband‚Äôs food was below subpar. The bday boy an I both had the prime rib. We requested we wanted medium well. It had no seasoning and was Bloody. The waitress( whom was doing her very best and was nice) said the chef would bring me the replacement, I told her I don‚Äôt want to see the chef, that I‚Äôd rather she (the waitress)  bring it. We sent it back and the chef gave me my exact prime rib back. The asparagus tasted like they picked it in a forest and threw it onto a plate. How is it the peach tea had a funky taste? We thought we were tripping until 3 tables, 2 behind us and 1 beside us all returned their food and were refunded. We did the same thing.  A sad shame. Oh and 1 table had waited 3 hrs to be seated, another waited forever for their food and finally left. The waitress apologized, I asked if the chef was new. To my astonishment, the waitress stated that the chef been there for years. 
A meeting really needs to be held on how to revamp the entire menu, how to properly prepare the food and delivering the dishes out in a timely manner.
The view? Windows need to be cleaned, stains and prints all over it.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The food was not good and my Cosmo I had to send back as I don't know what it actually was.  Disappointed for our 35th Anniversary dinner.  The ""known for Lava Cake"" was a dried out brownie with no nice gooey lava in it at all. Found out from the locals (a day too late) that is not the place to go if you want a good meal.",Bad,Bad,
"Very disappointed. 
Went to celebrate  my friend birthday
Restaurant  carpet was filty dirty aswell as the windows.  Service was below par.

"This restaurant is located in the Tower of America's.  Our server Chris was fantastic.   The calamari appetizer was good.  


My husband ordered the avocado burger.  I ordered  the prime rib French dip.  They were tasty but cold.   We didn't say anything because it took a while for us to get it.  


The hostess seated a group of 6 to the side of us.  So, they were looking directly at us the whole time.  There was a table for 6 3 tables down from us.  There looked so uncomfortable.",Good,Bad,Good
"I made 2:30pm reservations for April 17 to celebrate my fiancee's birthday; this was our first time visiting. We parked and checked in at the first floor hostess stand; the ladies were nice. I received a text at 2:30pm from the restaurant that said ""Your table is ready. Text 1 if you're ready."" I texted back at 1:35pm with the number 1. After waiting a while for the elevator,  I texted the number back at 1:45pm and said the elevator is taking forever. There's ONE elevator that's man-operated. We finally got to the top, and checked in again at that hostess  stand. We were told to wait shortly. A couple of another race were behind us and they were told the same thing. That couple was seated first. I looked at the man and the woman who were manning the stand because I was confused why weren't seated first. The man didnt say, ""hello,"" ""you'll be seated next,"" or anything. We were seated shortly after (maybe around 2:50pm). We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, one chart your course with prime rib, one chart your course with shrimp trio,  and two frozen margaritas. This was going to be a $150 tab for sure. We ordered all the food at once. We received our drinks (good) at 3:09pm, dip (delicious) at 3:24pm, New England soup (tasty) and Cesar salad at 3:34pm. At 3:45 the waiter comes and says he's sorry but he should have told us that no one can order the prime rib until 4pm. I have all the times correct thanks to SnapChat. We we're totally confused and taken back. After already waiting 20 minutes, we agreed to wait another 15 minutes, and we were still being polite. He explained that the kitchen will start working on it but he couldn't officially ring it up until 4pm. I told him that he should have told us that when we ordered it (between 3:09pm and 3:24pm). He said that hd was new and he should have known. We asked about the shrimp trio and he explained that he hadn't even out the order in b/c of the prime rib. WHAT?  I then told him to just bring it out with thr prime rib so that my fiancee and I could wat at the same time. We remained nice but were now growing very impatient. Our reservation was at 2:30pm!  So we're waiting, we're waiting, and waiting. At 4:05, we flag the waiter down, and he says the food is coming up. At this time we see parties that sat down after us receiving their checks.  At 4:20, I went to the hostess stand to ask for a manager. A couple of minutes later to my surprise, it was the same guy who stood at the hostess stand earlier. I explained everything I've just written above, I told him I was dissatisfied, and I told him I will just pay for what we ate, and his response was ""I can check on your order."" No apology,  no awareness, no concern, no hospitality, nothing. At 4:26, I just couldnt tolerate the disregard any longer. It was like we were invisible; I wasn't paying for anything at this point. We got on the elevator and left. We get to the lobby hostess stand and explain what happened and the girl apologized for our experience. I've never felt so disregarded. Here it is TWO HOURS later from our reservation, and an hour from when we initially ordered, and we still don't have our main course. The waiter said the kitchen was working on the prime rib at 3:45!   I'm supposed to pay $150 for this service? I hate to throw around the race card but I do hope that other black people are not treated this way.  Everyone else and multiple parties after us had already eaten and were leaving. None of the explanations that the waiter gave made any sense. In an honest person, have worked with Hilton Hotels for 13 years, and have been a meeting planner for 5 years. I am in the hospitality industry! There's no excuse for this service and I will not visit there again.",,Bad,Bad
The view in this rotating restaurant at 750 feet up is outstanding.  The food I was served was not. The service however was great.,Bad,Good,Good
"We went on a Sunday at 5 pm with a RESERVATION.  They only had 2 of their appetizers.  They had no shrimp so none of their dishes requiring shrimp were available.  They did not have lava cake; they had cheese cake!  The food we ordered was good, but not spectacular.  The view was the only redeeming part of the costly meal.  The wait staff was not attentive.  I'm a water drinker and only had one refill when the rest of the table got their second alcoholic drink.",Good,Good,Bad
"My husband and I went here as a special treat.  The food just doesn't measure up to Landry property standards.  I had a shrimp cocktail appetizer where shrimp were pretty large and firm but really lacked taste.  ( I started wondering if I had covid but could taste the cocktail sauce).  I  had spicy ahi for dinner which was really, really lack luster.  I was really disappointed.  The rice was good that it came with.  The sauce on plate had a simple chili flavoring.  Nothing complex here.  My husband had a steak that he said was good but really looked pretty thin and average.  The star of the dinner was the lava cake.  Nice chocolate cake with heath bits and vanilla ice cream.  The cocktails don't have much liquor in them.   My recommendation would be go to observation deck but spend money at dinner somewhere else.",Bad,Good,
"We kinda of had low expectations so we weren't disappointed in the food. It really kinda of sad but they just flat out miss the mark on serving a quality meal. We found the service to be okay, fine dinning this is NOT.  


Enjoy the view of San Antonio and order something simple. Don't",Bad,Good,Bad
"Amazing views atop the Tower of America‚Äôs.   That is the only good thing I can say about the Chart House.   Had lunch there today, New Years Day, and food was so-so at best and service was bad. 


Waiter was friendly, but had to be asked for stuff multiple times.   After a fairly lengthy wait, we asked for bread and he told us it would take six minutes.   After asking three more times we got it after 30 minutes.   After about 90 minutes we asked about our food and was told it was being plated....came out 10 minutes later.   My wife asked for a straw four times.   Drinks were empty much of the lunch (funny that they are empty in this picture).


The server didn‚Äôt have any help...he bused his own tables and delivered every item.


Steak was bland.   Lobster bisque was good, but hard to find the lobster.   Cod sandwich was OK.   Coconut shrimp was very good.   Crab / mango appetizer stack had all of the avocado in one chunk instead of being spread out.   Prime rib not available at lunch...even on New Years Day.


Not upscale dining.   Person at the table next to us was wearing under armor sweat pants and the manager was in jeans.",Bad,Good,Bad
"This restaurant has changed a lot this past year. The shrimp cocktail (salad) was a joke....shrimp was mushy and no ‚Äúsalad‚Äù. The prime rib came to the table cold, so I sent it back. It returned completely dry and over done. The asparagus side.....what else can I say except I couldn‚Äôt saw through the wood with my steak knife. The Sword  Fish was great, however the rice was not edible. Dry and flavorless. 
The waiter was great,",Bad,,Good
Amazing view! Food very disappointing! Ordered prime rib which consisted of 50% fat. NY steak order medium rare was served well done. Server praised the raw AhI which was then served blackened. All three main dishes ordered did not meet expectations.  Appetizers were bland as were the main dishes. Will not return .,Bad,Good,
Chart House is one of our go to‚Äôs for a nice view and nice meal but we walked out last night.  For some reason they weren‚Äôt using their private elevator and pushed you to the elevator for the observation deck where they were cramming as many people as possible into the elevator.  Guess all the signs and placards were just for show as there was no social distancing.  When we commented to the hostess who greats you when you enter the tower she just gave us a blank looked and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù.  Tried to call the restaurant to speak to a manager but no one answered the phone,,Bad,Bad
"Terrible service and food quality. I've eaten in the Tower of Americas many times as a child and now as an adult with children of my own. I was very disappointed though in the lack of service and food quality. When you drop almost $100 for two people you'd expect to have some quality in the service and food. We made reservations weeks in advance. Upon arrival they were running only one elevator so you were forced to wait in the same long line as those going to the observatory. We had a 6PM reservation and didn't get to the top until 6:30PM even after arriving a few minutes before 6PM. Our waitress, though she was friendly, was almost no where to be found throughout our meal. Our food was brought out by another person and our waitress never came back to check to see how the food was. My wife ordered the Lobster Bisque Soup and it came out cold. My entree was the Prime Rib and it was completely dry and you could hardly cut into it. I had ordered it Medium and there was no sight of pink in it. We spent 15min trying to find our waiter. I finally had to get up and stop the manager to get him to come to our table. He never apologized and just said he would get another one. Neither him or our waitress apologized. In fact the waitress didn't show back up until the replacement steak arrived. In my opinion you should skip the restaurant and just pay to go to the observatory. I hope that Brian Butler the Executive Chef and Chris Bouche see this post and work harder to improve on their food and service quality. Until they do so we will not be back.",Good,Good,Good
"View is unlike any other, and the scene is breathtaking, but the service is awful. Sadly this has become a tourist trap and the prices you pay for the meal, view, and atmosphere and absolutely not worth it. The service was terrible, it was 10 minutes before we were greeted, 30 minutes before we received our drinks and 45 before we received any bread appetizer. Overall do not go to the restaurant, horrible service and bad atmosphere. Just go to the overlook instead of wasting your money.",,Good,Bad
"I chose Chart House Restaurant-Tower of the Americas in San Antonio to celebrate my wife's birthday. We were a party of six. One person ordered Prime Rib, it had more fat than meat. 4 people had New York Strip Steak, and all commented on how their steak was DRY,stringy/chewy, flavorless and cold, along with cold mash potatoes. One person had stuffed shrimp, shrimp had no flavor and again cold. All these meals should have been hot. Ceasar Salads were wilty with very little dressing. Alcoholic beverages were watered down. There were too many patrons seated for eating and not enough servers to give the patrons needed attention or service for the price I paid. The Calamari appetizer and the view was GREAT. We had dined there a year ago and everything was perfect. However, this was an incredibly Bad. After raving about Chart House Restaurant-Tower of the Americas to our guest; it turned out to be a BIG disappointment and embarrassing. I will not return or recommend Chart House Restaurant - Tower of the Americas and will stay with Myron's for special occasions.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This experience was a waste of time. Bar was stacked with dirty dishes, the bar service area looked and smelled like a dive bar but charges $30 for a single drink and provided the ambiance of looking at stacks of dirty dishes behind the bar.


Ordered 3 appetizers and 2 entrees. After 30 minutes was told that they were out of one entree so we had only one entree to receive. It took an hour and 20 minutes to receive 1 medium steak and 2 sides. When it arrived everything was cold. Steak, mac and cheese with lobster and asparagus were cold and the plates were also cold.  


Still ended having to pay $30 for a waste of time. The manager was kind enough to take off 1 appetizer for having his location ruin a night out. Didn't even bother to invite us back and give them another chance. 


This location doesn't care of you like the food, the service or the ambiance. They just want to overcharge you that one time it takes to see what a horrible place this is. It is a shame because this could be a good location.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"So we had reservations at 10 but arrived at 7:40pm and they seated us. The service was really poor. Long waits, dirty silverware on the table, my wine had pieces of cork in it. After we finish with the appetizers, thinking we will get our main dish, the waiter tells us they are out of swordfish. Once the main dishes arrived, finally, they were really good! That‚Äôs why the 2 stars instead of one. We didn‚Äôt get to dessert because we wanted the famous chocolate lava-cake, but the swordfish ate the last one and took off. ü§™",Good,Bad,Bad
The service was atrocious! The staff were pleasant however not in the slightest bit efficient given how many there were. After being seated for 20 minutes we had to ask for someone to serve us. Food was reasonable though not worth the cost. The kid on the parking ticket booth overcharged us for the parking which we realised later after looking at the website. All in all a very less than average night. If I could score less than one I would. Definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend!,Bad,Bad,Bad
"My husband and I had the coconut shrimp ($28), the bowl of lobster bisque ($12), the grilled scallops & shrimp ($39) and a couple virgin mixed drinks (about $5 each).  I wasn't sure what to expect due to the mixed reviews, but I would say the food, in terms of cooking and flavor was 4.5 stars.. The non-alcholic drinks were good as well.  However, as you might expect from a fine dining and tourist place, portion sizes were medium to small.  The ""bowl"" of lobster soup ($12) was very disappointing and misleading in terms of size--it is actually what typical restaurants serve as a ""cup"" (not sure what the ""cup"" sized order would look like here). Although I knew we would pay more for the ambiance, experience, and view at this place, I would say the restaurant is still overpriced to the point of taking advantage of tourists and visitors.  The Chart House supposedly serves a lunch menu from 11AM to 2PM.  However, when we arrived on a Tuesday at 11:30 AM, we were only given the dinner menu.  When I asked why, they said only the dinner menu was available on a holiday.  First, this wasn't posted on their website anywhere, and second, it was New Year's EVE morning, which isn't considered a holiday by banks, offices, and standard America (unlike New Years DAY).  Also, while we were there, we heard them telling people they were closing down at 2:00 PM due to some evening event.  Again, this information wasn't available on their website and there weren't any signs posted in the building until almost the last minute (i.e., the last hour or two). We also couldn't figure out what event was going on that evening and whether it was a private event or open to the public (or whether tickets were required or still available).  On a positive note, we weren't rushed to eat our meal (the place wasn't full), and we were able to go to the observatory without paying another fee.  Please note that the 5-7 minute movie, Flags Over Texas, is NOT included when eating at the restaurant--we had to pay half the advertised price ($7 each), and the other ""included""movies were cancelled at the last minute and unavailable (so we were exploited once again, although you could say their partner, Tower of Americas, was the guilty party here).  My tip to visitors who are budget conscious--try the Happpy Hour at the bar (with small plates) but call first to make sure the menus and prices are really in effect and no events are going on that will impact your visit.  (However, you may not get a person to actually answer the phone, which is what happened when I called the afternoon before).",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We did not have reservations but called before we toured the tower.  ‚ÄúReservations not needed.  Come on up.‚Äù  Ok.  That‚Äôs what we tried to do.  Very poor signage on ground floor.

So, we did.  ‚ÄúDo you have reservations?‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo, but we were told to ‚ÄòCome on up.‚Äô‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe wait is over 2.5 hours.‚Äù  So, we went up in the elevator to The Chart House.  ‚ÄúNo reservations?  If not, the wait is over 2.5 hours.‚Äù  We were never told that to begin with.  Apparently, they aren‚Äôt allowed to quote a wait time.  So, we waited in the elevator line twice for nothing.  Not a good way to do business.  The restaurant looked very nice. That‚Äôs as far as we got.",,Bad,Bad
"I ordered a salad .. $12 ... and it was no bigger than the size of a small apple ... it was flavorful, the 3 bites I got. Our table order the hummus sampler ... pretty presentation for prepackaged hummus. One person ordered quail that came out burnt...we addressed this with the waitress who nicely asked if we wanted a replacement.  We declined because we didn‚Äôt want to chance another mess up and additional food wasted ... they charged us for the un-ate quail anyways. The lava cake was good. The mango mojito was wonderful. The atmosphere and view was great. The Cabernet was average. Overall the cost of the food and quality of the food was way way over priced for the taste. The experience of the view and atmosphere was worth it though.",Bad,Good,
"My husband and I reserved for a romantic date over a month in advance. They called us a few weeks later canceling our reservation due to a ""glitch"" in the computer. However when I called, the employee said they took a last minute event. Chart House is incredibly unprofessional and I will never recommend this place no matter the view.",,Bad,Bad
"This is an event & although we had some issues, the food was very good & the view was amazing!  Broken glass on our table when we were seated, dirty glass brought next, both steaks were over cooked, but still good.  presentation of lava cake was not good, but it was still wonderful.

Don‚Äôt even bother ordering from the wine list. Vintages are all wrong and they want to charge the same price for a newer bottle. We tried to order some wine but of course they didn‚Äôt have the correct vintage. When we finally settled on a wine, just to have some, it had turned and we sent it back. We sent back two bottles.

"Went to eat at the Chart House for a family birthday dinner. The waitress was very nice, but was not organized and quite scattered.  It took 3 hours for our meal due to delays in taking orders and getting our food. We ordered a double berry mule and an old fashioned and both were not good. The bread is delicious if you are actually able get any in a timely manner.  Calamari appetizer was pretty tasty.  The coconut shrimp was good, but not great.  The blackened salmon was flavorful as well as the coconut ginger rice, but the grilled vegetables were pretty much raw as if they cut them up and plated them right from the fridge.  The filet ordered was charred and very over done instead of medium as ordered. The lava cake was pretty good, however it was lukewarm after taking the 30 minutes of required prep time.  The waitress did take time to recognize my daughter‚Äôs birthday by placing a candle in the lava cake and having happy birthday written in chocolate on the plate. That was a nice touch.  Overall, our bill was $200 for subpar food and service. Would expect more when at that price point.  The views were spectacular, but not sure I would return to eat here.",Bad,Good,Bad
"The view is spectacular of course.  We went on a Saturday afternoon after checking the online menu.  We arrived and were seated promptly by the hostess and given menus, it was about 2:20pm.  The menu given us was for dinner.  The waiter came over and we asked for a lunch menu.  He told us that lunch was over at 2pm and they only served the dinner menu.  (No where on the WEB site or menu did it say a time).  We asked if we could order from the lunch menu and were told No.  We asked to speak to the manager and was told he would just say the same thing as they were preparing the kitchen for the evening rush as they had over 300 reservations!  
We were about to leave when our guests from out of town said it was ok and we should stay.  We did stay even though we were not thrilled with expensive dinner menu when we went to have the lunch entrees!  The waiter was very polite but we never did see a manager.  I realize it is a tourist destination so one little group doesn‚Äôt make difference to the place, but we are locals and it is usually a place we would suggest and go to for lunch with guests.  
Never again..",,Bad,Good
"I arranged a honeymoon dinner for my friend and her new husband. I called ahead to make payment arrangements. Was sent the paperwork I needed to fill out. I sent it back and waited for a call back to get my credit card info. I never got a call back. I called back and we did what we were told to do. We waited for another call back but didn't receive it. We called back again and asked if we should just come in to pay it since it was about an hour before their reservation. I was told no that they had the proper info and everything was taken care of. My friend went on their dinner, which was a surprise, and said everything was wonderful. The restaurant even honored the requests that were given when I made the payment arrangements.  Their seating, food , and service was great. It wasn't until the next day that I realized there was a problem. My card was never charged. After talking to my friend I found out that they paid for their meal. They didn't realize that it was already paid for. I contacted the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager. I was put on hold and then disconnected. I called right back and was told that they were too busy and I needed to call them back later. I told them that this was important. That they mistakenly charged my friend when I had already made payment arrangements. I was put on hold and a manager answered a few minutes later. The manager figured out what was wrong and said that they would reimburse their card and charge mine. I was told that it could take a couple weeks to show up in her account. I was not happy about this but was willing to deal with it since there isn't much else they can do. The manager told me she would contact me on Friday to verify that everything was going smoothly. It is now Saturday and I still have not received a call. I feel completely blown off. I feel that my business was not appreciated and my friends had to leave this morning not knowing what's going on with their money. Their wedding did not go as planned so this was something I wanted to do for them. They should not have been stressed on their honeymoon and should not have had to pay for this meal when arrangements had already been made. I'm very disappointed. I have dined here several times in the past and never had an issue. Everything from the food to the service was perfect. But not this time. I think the biggest shock for me was being told to call back because the manager was to busy to deal with my problem. I would never tell a dissatisfied customer to call me back. And then to be lied to. Very disappointed.",,Bad,Bad
"Visited Tower of America's & was advised to get a drink at the bar to see the views without having to go to the observation deck. We arrived at a good time, not long after happy hour started (4.30pm) by chance as we didn't know & got a table easy. We shared the lettuce wraps & prime rib sliders. Both tasted better then what they looked. I also enjoyed a few mojitos on happy hour special also. We left after happy hour finished at 7pm & there were lots of people table stalking us. Service friendly.",Good,Good,Good
"Average food, kids running around.  They ran out of Mahi, offered us sea bass cooked the same way then tried to charge us more than the mahi dish.  They did end up taking if off our bill completely so can‚Äôt complain.  No ‚Äúlava‚Äù in the lava cake.",Good,Bad,
"Excellent food but service was below expectation and missing the normal  courses for a supposed upscale restaurant.   We had to ask for bread to nibble while waiting for an appetizer, no salad before the main course, and waitress was only average.",Good,,Bad
"The atmosphere was not as upscale as I thought it would be. I‚Äôve lived in San Antonio my entire life. First time eating there.  Lots of people in jeans and shorts. The food was average. Not worth the price. 
If you get dizzy easily, not the place for you.",Bad,Bad,
Food was pretty good but quite pricey for the quality. Shrimp appetizer was so so. Seats were great and kids enjoyed the view. Our waiter seemed disappointed we did not order more beverages or appetizers than we did. Had to ask for drink refills several times. Overall decent experience.,Good,Good,
"The Experience: We had dinner reservations for March 4th  - a bucket list item for my husband who is a born and raised Texan (Houstonian).  It was a cold day, temps in the low 30's.  We arrived downstairs, checked in with the hostess, had our picture taken and then got in line for the elevator.  The trip in the elevator was decent.  There was some overhead information, but it was difficult to understand.  The elevator moved quickly and there were windows.  Once at the top, you had to check in with ANOTHER hostess and then wait a few minutes while they prepared your table.  While waiting for a table, it was COLD.  But, I figured, the restaurant part would be warmer.  WRONG.  The restaurant, was FREEZING COLD.  Everyone in there was bundled up in hats, coats, sweatshirts, or whatever they had.  It was SO cold, the ambiance was just shot!  The view was nice, but with the A/C blasting, it was difficult to enjoy the view.  At one point, my hands were SO COLD, I could barely hold my fork.  
The food:  The food was just ok.  My husband enjoyed his steak and garlic potato mash.  I had the Chicken Francese.  It was a pan-fried thin chicken breast.  There was supposed to be a lemon-butter sauce, but there was next to none.  It was very dry.  There were a whopping 2 artichoke quarters (so half of ONE artichoke heart) and 3 slices of mushroom at the most.  For $27 I expect a little more.   The pasta was overcooked.  
I ordered a fleur-de-lis drink and was served a Fiery Cucumber. They did fix it once we brought it to their attention.  The Fleur-de-lis tasted like pineapple juice.  I didn't taste any of the other flavors that were noted in the details (rum, peach).  I figured since they originally served me the wrong drink, they didn't want to lose any more money, so they gave me pineapple juice at the tune of $9.00.  For dessert, we chose the Apple/Dried Cherry Crumble.  We were going for something hot, because it was SO COLD. It had ice cream on top.  It was good, but nothing special.
The Service:  Other than the drink SNAFU, the service was excellent.  Our server and a female server were very nice and helpful.  
We went there, and did that.  Based on our experience, we will not go back.  


Side Note - after spending $150.00 in the restaurant, you cannot purchase your picture for less than $27.  IF you spend $14.00 per person to go to the Observation Deck, ONLY THEN can you purchase a photo for $5.00.  I know that has nothing to do with the restaurant, but still.  I just spent 2 hours in your 40 degree restaurant, freezing my a** off, and $150.00 to boot, but you want me to pay $27 + tax for a photo?  I think not.",Bad,Bad,Good
"This was our first time to San Antonio and to a Chart House restaurant.  We were excited to have this view of the city and also sample the local seafood. We were four hungry adults dining.  Our waiter took our cocktail order and returned to explain the chef specials for the day.  They were offering a lightly crusted sea bass, pan-seared and topped with crab & lobster meat.  The second chef special was a surf & turf, served with a 7 oz filet mignon and a 7 oz lobster tail.  We were told by the waiter both specials came with a seasonal vegetable medley and a ""fully-loaded"" baked potato.  I hadn't seen a ""fully-loaded"" baked potato on the menu so assumed it meant butter and sour cream.  The waiter started taking our order and after telling him our choice of entree he would then ask, ""would you like soup or salad with that?""  After the 2nd person ordered, it dawned on us that the ""soup or salad"" wasn't part of the meal and was going to come at a cost of $11/each.  We all declined except one.  We had ordered two of the larger appetizers that we were told was going to be plenty for 4.  Three of us opted for the sea bass special and the fourth the surf and turf special.  The waiter then asked if we would be ordering a dessert?  He explained the house dessert, which was a chocolate molten cake, needed to be order at the same time as the entree so it would have time to bake.  We told him we would pass on the house dessert but to bring by the dessert menu and we'd see if there were other offerings that might tempt us.  By the time the dessert menu came, and our second round of cocktails, two of us were boxing up nearly our entire entrees including sides, so none of us had room for more food let alone dessert.  When the bill arrived, we found that not only had the waiter added the house dessert onto the bill, but he had also charged us an additional $3.00/person for the ""fully-loaded"" baked potato which he had said came with the special!!  
I find it incredulous that a restaurant who's not shy with their pricing would resort to these types of tactics and that a waiter also takes it upon himself to add additional items to the bill in an effort to boost the tip.  Our tab was well over $400 for the four of us so to try and screw us further by sneaking in additional items was totally incredible!  The whole experience left a bad taste in our mouths and ruined what should have been a very pleasant evening out in San Antonio.  We will not be returning to another Landry's Restaurant in the future.  Diner beware when reading through your tab!!!",Bad,Bad,
"We found this restaurant very loud. The bar is very small and overcrowded. The food is average at best. Really, the view is the only reason to come here. $15 parking and not that easy to walk here. Lots of kids which makes the already noisy place even worse.",Bad,Bad,
"I went there with part of a group and we had a set menu for $54. I got the prime rib. The salad was gross arugula. The prime rib was of lesser quality than I've gotten at Texas Roadhouse at three times the price. The mashed potatoes were meh. Service was SLOW. Some people at my table didn't get their entree until the rest of us were almost done. The most disappointing thing is I'm sure I could've gotten a really good steak somewhere else in this town, but I wasted my evening there.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had reservations for 5 PM on a Sunday night.  Arrived at the Tower at 4:30 and paid our $15 to park.  Went into the tower and waited in a short line to check in at the lobby desk.  They directed us to the elevator line where we waited about 15 minutes for our ride to the restaurant.  Once discharged from the elevator we waited in another line to speak to the hostess.  She told us to wait and someone would be with us.  After about 10 minutes we were seated and given menus.  Another wait of about 5 minutes and our waitress returned to take our drink orders, two beers and a glass of wine and it took another 10 minutes to deliver the drinks.  We had the ""Wicked Tuna"" appetizer (very good and an excellent presentation) Lobster Bisque (great) New England Clam Chowder (this was really great, if you go don't miss this) and our entrees, mahi mahi and a small filet mignon.  The entrees were okay but I expected better for the price.  The facility itself was presentable but will need of a face lift before long.  The rotation of the restaurant was faster than most of the rotating restaurants I have visited and the motion was slightly jerky.  The view was mildly interesting but not spectacular.  Bottom line I am glad I went there once but will never go there twice.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We went for a date night and had a reservation.  We decided to come early to enjoy the views from the bar, and that was a good thing because we waited over 30 minutes for the elevator to take us up to the top.  We were told that there was only one elevator attendance on duty that night, creating the wait.  Why???  Once there, the views truly were spectacular and enjoyable.  The restaurant seemed overused and in need of refurbishment.   Our waiter was pleasant and helpful, and the food was really very good.  We will go to Landry's next time for the food and skip the wait on the elevator!",Good,Good,Good
We decided to eat an early dinner around 5pm. I understand why the restaurant is empty at that time. The sun blazes in on you on the west side. Glad I had my sunglasses. The movement was slow enough to not get carsick but I wouldn‚Äôt eat here again during daylight although the view was spectacular. Food was ok. Service was good.,Good,Bad,Good
"Booked an 11am (first of the day) reservation today (Sunday).  The restaurant was not crowded.  Our experience started off poorly when the waitress came back, after we order a couple of cocktails and appetizers, to tell us that ‚Äúnot all the elements were ready‚Äù for the Bruschetta Board we ordered as an appetizer.  I interpreted that as ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have time to prep your order‚Äù. We ordered another option...  but still waited an unusually long time for our appetizers and cocktails to come to our table. The two appetizers came to our table individually 5 minutes apart, and the cocktails trickled to the table individually after that.  


As to our main course, my wife‚Äôs spare ribs was excellent. Her knife was cleared from the table with her appetizer and the waitress never brought her a new one with her main course.  We never saw her again to ask for a knife until we finished our meal.  My lobster Mac and cheese was excellent, but my shrimp and scallops was barely above room temperature.  


As we were leaving, I went into the bathroom to realize the men‚Äôs room had no toilet paper in either of the two rods.  So, turning around and exiting, I mentioned that to my wife and she said the women‚Äôs bathroom had trash that was overflowing.  It appears to me that no one checks on the cleanliness of the bathrooms either at the end of the night before, or at the beginning of the morning shift. 


I expect more from a linen table cloth, $150 meal for two type of establishment.  


So, bring your own cutlery, bring your own bathroom supplies, the food can be good, and the view is amazing!",Good,Bad,
"We are in town visiting for several days, and I had previously been to the Chart House.  Let me start by saying that the view is amazing even at lunch.  I wanted my two teenagers and husband to have the experience as well.  We were seated quickly but it took forever for the server to get our water and tea.  Once we finally got our food, our sever seemed to disappear and the restaurant was not overly busy.  We had to ask for water and our check to pay.  The food was pretty good and the view was wonderful but the service was lacking.",Good,Good,Bad
"Went to Chart House for engagement celebration. Waited 40 minutes for table despite having a reservation. Waited another 10-15 minutes before server came to table. By the time we received a glass of water it was close to 1 hour. Ordered a Filet and my fianc√© the Mahi. He said his was okay but not worth the price. The server came to the table about 10 minutes after ordering and said no more Filet so had to chose something else. Really, you are out?? I ordered the NY Strip which was more expensive and not as good. No sorry or suggestion. Not even a comp dessert or anything. The food was okay but not for $150 for two people. I‚Äôve had a lot of great restaurants and this was poor. The service was horrible. The only thing that was good was the view but that‚Äôs it. What was supposed to be a great evening turned into to a huge disappointment. Would not recommend!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
Attended a business dinner and you really can‚Äôt beat the view! Time to get meal took forever and food was poor to average. Crab legs were rubbery and definitely not fresh. One of our guests steak was way over cooked and had to be sent back. Lava cake took forever and was way over rated. Best bet would be to take your spouse/date up for a drink during happy hour and go eat somewhere else. Normally $16 to go up and view from observation deck.  I‚Äôd rather go up free and pay for a drink and appetizer during happy hour!,Bad,Good,
"My husband and I visited on a weekday, which we thought would make things easy. However, we had to wait approximately one hour to be seated and then almost another hour for our meal. The place was not that crowded and empty tables were definitely present. Although the Chart House is known for its seafood, we assumed that filet mignon would be a safe bet, especially at the prices they charge. Unfortunately, we were sadly mistaken. The steaks were somewhat grisly and our medium well done steaks were more on the well side. We could have sent them back but we did not want to be there another hour.  Even the mashed potatoes were mediocre...something that‚Äôs hard to do.  While the view is nice, there are other revolving restaurants in the US that you can visit with better food and overall service..although our waiter was terrific.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We went there to celebrate our 1 year anniversary and ended up paying $120 to have my phone stolen by a staff member (I could tell it was in the kitchen of staff room in the center of the tower because when the manager moved it, so did the locator), and the steak was so under cooked, the tendon was impossible to chew through. The only reason why I'm not giving it one star was because our waiter was kind and patient during my panic.",Bad,Bad,Good
"I have eaten at many Chart House's over the years and was looking forward to the visit.  Unfortunately, this location is awful in every category.  First the sun was directly in our eyes as we tried to eat and the management said they were not allowed to put up shades, which is a very poor excuse.  Secondly, the air conditioning was grossly inadequate.  We were all literally perspiring profusely due to the heat.  Third, the food was nothing special.  I had a piece of salmon with some shrimp on top and it was no better than a Red Lobster presentation.  Overall, this is a huge waste of money.  Not only is the meal overpriced, but be prepared to pay $15 to park.",Bad,Bad,
"Often times, chain tourist spot dining that turns out to be more about the setting than the food is a cliche of the travel experience; think Planet Hollywood and Hard Rock Cafe. In the case of Chart House at Tower of the Americas, the cliche plays out pretty predictably. There was nothing about the food or service that was bad, but given the prices, I can say that we weren't wowed by what we were served, with the possible exception of the strong mojitos from the bar. Yes, the view is fun if you enjoy skyscrapers, which I do. Just don't expect greatness. It is what it is.",,Good,
"This place is elegant with amazing views. It seems like they would have food that equals the view. With Texas being a cattle state, I could not wait to have a good steak but mine was mediocre. I inquired if it was local beef and was surprised that the server didn't know and didn't bother to find out either. We did eat late (around 9pm) I ordered the larger filet, cooked medium and butterflied. It was not very tender at all, was seasoned a little spicy and only came with mashed potatoes. For $46 I was expecting a much higher quality steak. I tried my sister's prime rib and again it was just average. I have had better food at Texas Roadhouse.",Bad,Good,
"So let's start off with initially I called about their happy hour hours was told to come on in. I looked online at happy hour menu very reasonable and nice selection. I was greeted at the base of the tower informed bar area was closed for private event (wasn't told when I called). I was also told I can still enjoy happy hour within the restaurant (great). Was greeted told them we were here to enjoy dinner and happy hour but was motioned to yes you could ""seat yourself there"" 5 tables which were all filled, I proceeded to go back to the hostess and asked was there another area or will the bar area open up as the 5 tables she pointed to were all full. She then proceeded to walk with me 3-5 steps and pointed I could have happy hour in this area (pretty vague as there were plenty of empty tables and some that were full). We proceeded to seat ourselves where we were led to believe it was ok, was greeted by a pleasant young woman our server we will be having happy hour and dinner. She promptly brought us a dinner menu as we had a happy hour menu, we ordered some cocktails and appetizers to share. It wasn't until after we ordered did she come back and said that ""a manager"" told her to tell us that since where we were seated happy hour wasn't available. Hmm, considering the employees downstairs said with the private event happy hour is served in the restaurant and when the hostess led and pointed to an ""open area"" we were led to believe was acceptable. The food was good the server was cordial and pleasant. However I would hope that management reads this as a teachable moment if guests are led to believe one thing by the associates then you should honor there decisions yes within reason. Will I be back of course as I work in the downtown area. I will just be mindful when ordering...",Good,,Good
"My experience: we called at around 10am to verify whether or not we needed reservations. The lady who answered the phone assured me that although they were advised particularly for dinner, lunch time is generally much quicker and a reservation was not needed. Foolishly, I didn't make a reservation. Although based on the waitresses comments while we were there, I doubt it would have mattered! So, when we got there, we were told it would be an hour wait. We were informed that we could sit up at the bar in the meantime and have a drink and app. So we did. OVER an hour later we STILL were no where near being seated. NOW.... one would surmise that this was due to the place being crowded... not so. As we sat up above we were able to look down and see MANY tables rotating by that were empty...... At that point we had enough and paid our bill and left. 


Food was ok. Nothing wrong with it at all. We had calamari, two orders of coconut shrimp and the fondue app. We had a bloody mary, one other alcoholic beverage, a water and three sodas. (party of 6 -- two of which were kiddos). The bill came to about $120. A little on the pricey side. Service was obviously slower than a sloth.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Great service. Spectacular view and atmosphere. Food was just average tasting and my salmon was too salty. Please give this review a helpful vote.,Bad,Good,Good
"The food and drinks are hit-or-miss AND expensive. Service is ok, atmosphere is noisy BUT... you have the view. 


DO NOT order the Mojito sampler, it is expensive and sickeningly sweet with no discernible alcohol. I liked the Aji ""nachos"" (more like a few tortilla chips with slices of fish on them fyi) and the delightful and inexpensive non-alcoholic drinks at the back of the bar menu ($5 and $2 for refills!). The ""Faux-jito"" was f-a-r better than the Mojito sampler I hated. 


Sliders were decent although they are basically roast beef with some nice au jus, calamari was acceptable but mostly consisted of french fries and onions, peppers and other extras. Hummus was pretty bad, we love hummus but not any of those options, a hungry group of four did not finish it. 


I'll be back, but I'll be careful what I order and focus on the cheaper happy hour options!


p.s. I walked down all 63+ flights of stairs, can't say I recommend it but I had to work off all that sugar from the Mojito sampler!",Bad,Good,Good
"I read the reviews after we ate here as a group. Learn from our mistake.  Don't go as a group.  We scheduled in advance and were assured a group of 12 would be no problem.  We arrived downstairs on-time for our reservations only to learn that we had to take turns to ride the elevator since the bar and half the elevator time was apparently reserved by a corporation for the evening.  So we made sure a few of our party got up there in case there was confusion about our timely arrival.  These elevators are rockets so how long could this take?  Well the elevator goes up, the elevator comes down, the OTHER side of the elevator opens and loads up then repeats the process from different cue lines so 30 minutes later we finally joined our group who was waiting.  Not for us with our jokes of glass half full glass elevator tales but for our reserved table to be cleared.  


We asked for the next hour and a half (as droves of individuals, couples and groups of 4 were seated) and each time we were assured our table was almost clear, was being set, was being cleaned, was just becoming available in just such a confusing order as I relay to you now.  The little hostesses were all huddled behind the little hostess desk hiding from the big scary group of hungry people that keep staring as if a reservation is some kind of general understanding due a logical explanation as to why these empty tables spinning by could not be pushed together to accommodate them. As we sat and stood in hearing distance we heard them tell people to come on in there was only a 30 minute wait without reservations. 


We were seated by a hostess. Then we waited for a waiter.  And we waited for menus. And we waited for water.  And we waited for bread.  And we waited for more bread and water.  And we waited to have our orders taken and I watched the waiter talk others out of appetizers, salads, courses and even suggested they share portions.  The oddest thing I have ever seen by someone not working for Weight Watchers whose compensation is at least partially paid with gratuity calculated by a gross ticket percentage.  I can only guess at that altitude and at that late hour the food was running out?  But he was alone and we forgave and we all settled in and entrees came and all was well until it came time for dessert.  They had a signature Lava Cake many in the group ordered excitedly only to be warned that is ALWAYS at least 30-45 minutes to prepare.  Did someone order Baked Alaska or Duck L'orange I'm thinking? Aside from the fact I am not a pastry chef tired on my feet from a full day slowing me down I can personally prepare a mean one in 15 min (20 in a dirty kitchen with the oven starting cold) So immediately the enthusiastic excited looked sheepish until the numbers if disappointed overcame the worry of imposition and they went all in.  True to ""their Chart House word"" it took a mere 58 minutes from ordering to arrival of some of the driest, coolest ""freshly prepared"" lava cakes I have ever seen.  The ice-cream however reprieved from the cocoa inferno remained un-melted atop a $12 brownie, so that was nice.


I always say Bad Good I will try it again but Bad great food and my shadow will never darken the door.  Best of luck to you adventurous in small groups.  The view is nice. Starvation fogged the early meal memory of a meat, presumed potato etc. I had a really good Trio of Creme Brulees and good strong coffee as my own dessert.  It truly was a delicious. 


Nothing else worth waiting for.",Good,Good,Bad
"First and foremost, you come here for the view and that is phenomenal.  We had reservations for a party of 14 and had to wait an hour to be seated after our reservation time which was frustrating.  When we were finally seated the server seemed to be in a hurry and actually tried to convince us not to order salads which was a first for us.  We ordered quite a few different dishes and everyone ate theirs without comments, so apparently nothing stood out as outstanding.  I had the filet and it was tender as it should be. My daughter had the coconut shrimp and it was good she said.  My husband had the largest cut of the prime rib and it was cooked incorrectly.  The entire meal with dessert and coffee took way too long,.  Since they were rushing us to get out, they could have mentioned early on that if you think you want the signature dessert it takes 30 minutes to prepare.  However, it took 1 hour and 10 minutes (yes we timed it) from the time all orders were placed to the time the lava cakes came to our table.  I do realize that a large party takes longer, but this really is too long to wait.  The cake was decadent and delicious however there was no ‚Äúlava‚Äù so that was very disappointing after such a wait.


The bathroom is very modern with opaque doors on the stalls which was quite a surprise


I doubt I would return here if ever in the area again.  My recommendation would be do NOT go here unless you have 6 or less people in your party.  This restaurant is not staffed to handle large groups (our table should have had 2 servers not 1).",Bad,Good,Bad
We had reservations for a week for 16 people and with only a handful of other guests they couldn‚Äôt seem to get the food out of the kitchen. My table was served first and 3 out of the 8 had to send the prime rib back because it was stone cold. It was beautiful med-rare and when we got it back It was ruined by torching it in a micro wave. We were lucky even with that because our other table was not even served for at least an hour with one guest telling them just to forget it. Very disappointed ! This place should get new management or better yet just close !,Bad,Bad,Bad
"Not your typical Chart House experience.  Food (3 steaks) was just ok.  Overyl salted and served luke warm, kind of like it was warmed up with old potato's.


Cool View and attentive staff",Bad,Good,Good
"Figured Easter Sunday at 4:30 would work with our reservation.  Great views of the city up there! .Then it went downhill...Seating was delayed 15 min, even though there was no other guest at the waiting area.  Then bread took about 1 hour to arrive, salad only another 20 min more, the entrees about another hour and finally at 7:38 we were able to leave.  3+ hours of dinner.  And we had been to this place 2 years ago with Good.  My take is this restaurant is critcally short staffed, so the staff they have are overworked, poorly tipped and always leaving for a better employer.  There are many great places in SATX, actually, every other place in town has been pretty Good during this Final4 weekend, BUT this Chart House.  Go up to the lounge for a drink and view then head elsewhere to eat.",,Good,Bad
"We went yesterday for an Easter lunch with my family. Our reservations were made over a month ago, we showed up 10 mins early to be safe. 
We waited nearly an hour with 2 small children, when we asked when we would be seated long after our reservation time passed, we were given no hard and fast answers. We eventually left with multuple other families who had been waiting more than 45 mins for a seat. There were 4 hosts doing very little, a manager who just stared at everyone and according to the staff the reason everything was so backed up was becasue ""waiters did not show up for their shifts""
It is hard to explain to kids why multiple empty tables keep coming by and you haven't been seated. 


Very disappointed, had to pay 25.00 for parking for nothing.",,Bad,Bad
"Wow I have never had a such a horrible experience! This place gets a star for its view and that‚Äôs it. First we got led to a dirty table, with no remorse. Once we were sat we ordered a bottle of wine and the glass was so dirty I couldn‚Äôt even bare it. My boyfriend got a cold soup brought to the table. Of course we still had high hopes for dinner but we were very let down. My $50 steak came out cold and under cook ( i know steak and it was not what i ordered) instead of the waiter taking it back like any other nice establishment, he argued with me. All in all this was a HUGE disappointment and i would never recommend it to anyone. Sorry Chart house but you guys need to seriously step up your game.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We made the reservation but had to wait when we came. The service wasn't very good and took so long. Our waiter never came by asking if we were alright or needed anything else. However, the view was nice and beautiful and we like the fact that the restaurant was spinning.",,Good,Bad
"Chart House is the top tier restaurant in the Landry's family of restaurants.  Our family of six go here for special events because its top of the Tower of Americas location lends itself to the ""special"" atmosphere.  The food is above average and the menu includes everything from seafood and steak to lamb and poultry.  The service has been poor on our last two visits.  There is a problem with the entire table getting served their drinks and plates at the same time.  Due to the frequency of this problem, I don't believe it is the server, more likely the kitchen and bar.  The service is always slow which is uncomfortable for youngsters.",Good,Good,Bad
"I've visited San Antonio many times and never had the courage to ride the elevator to the top of the Hemisphere Tower. This visit I did; what a disappointment. The wait for a table in the revolving restaurant was over an hour long. We were offered to eat at the bar and lounge area on the floor above the restaurant. We were promised it was the same food service. So we said ok and went up on the elevator. On exit from the elevator we were met with chaos. People were waiting around just outside the doors. Some were waiting for a table others for the elevator going down. But the elevator wasn't going down it was going up so the congestion persisted. The bar/lounge area is small and compact and there are no were near enough tables for the folks they send up there. We had to scramble for a table. We pounced when a table was vacated. It was piled high with dirty dishes. I cleared it myself. We noticed that there was only two wait staff taking care of the tables. One was a very hard worker. The other spent most of her time floating around doing nothing much at all. I seriously felt sorry for her co-worker. She was trying to do everything, serving, clearing, trying to seat new arrivals, taking orders, running back and forward to the kitchen to check on food orders... I'd hire her for any business I ran. She took our orders, got hubby and son's drinks and eventually brought me my pot of tea. The teapot was broken and so badly cracked the table was swimming in tea a minute after it was placed there. I decided I'd just have water. We waited an age for our food. meanwhile a kitchen staff had brought out, at three different intervals, three plates of food. Each plate was left sitting to the side of the bar and just left there! No one was informed that this food was there, and the wait staff were so busy they basically worked on with it sitting under their noses. After a while our waitress offered us a plate of Coconut Shrimp that the kitchen had messed-up an order on. She said it was free. So we took it. I have to say, this was the absolute best thing we got. It was cooked to perfection and was delicious. Much later our waitress went to the kitchen and got our food. Two fish and chips and a burger. Simple, easy, food? Not here! Of the four small fish fillets two were freezing cold and the other two barely warm. The fries were sweet-potato fries and although they looked good they were cold. The burger was no better. Sad to say this visit was such a disappointment.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We remember when Chart House used to be a great place to dine in Hawaii or Los Gatos, CA.  This place was just terrible.  So dark, I had to use my iPhone to read the menu, wear my coat it was so cold, which matched the food.  Our entree took about 45 minutes to show up and then my Snapper was over cooked and Luke warm to cold, the lumped crab tasted as if they opened a can of crab and dumped it on top.  The asparagus was bitter and tough and room temp.  My wife's stuffed flounder with crab was over cooked and tasted like dried cardboard and did I mention, it was cold.  The mashed potatoes were tasty but did I mention cold.  If you are looking for a quality seafood meal, save your money, drive up to New Braunfels and check out The Reel.  Better food that is served hot.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Do you want to celebrate a special occasion by treating friends, colleagues or family to lunch or dinner? The Chart House offers a nice view and decent food to do so for a reasonable amount of money. The incompetence and immaturity of the hosts and the waiters though is really disappointing. A simple request of handling the bill discretely made repeatedly upon reservation proved to be very difficult to be fulfilled. It is really sad.",Good,Good,Bad
"My sister and I were in San Antonio for a conference. We had gone to the Tower observation deck earlier in the day and decided to return for dinner after dark to take advantage of the stunning views of the city. The restaurant has a beautiful atmosphere and the views of the city at night did not disappoint. Our food was delicious and the presentation was beautiful. However, our waitress (Rochelle) was nothing short of rude. The minute we sat down at the table she was trying to push us to order alcohol, appetizers, and dessert (before we even ordered our meal). When we declined, she immediately adopted a dismissive attitude, and became short, abrupt, and arrogant. I would return to the restaurant because the food and atmosphere were great, but I will make sure Rochelle is not my server!  Management should remove her from their staff.",Good,Good,Bad
"The restaurant clearly exists for the views, which are amazing.  I was able to get a reservation at sunset, and watching the sun go down and the lights come up was incredible.


Unfortunately, the food and service were not good.  I was in San Antonio for a conference, so I ate alone.  It took about 25 minutes for a drink to arrive, and another half hour for an appetizer.  I sat with an empty appetizer plate in front of me, empty water glass, and empty cocktail cup for 45 minutes with no waitstaff in sight.  Finally, my waiter came and asked how my appetizer was.  I said t was fine and that I was done with it.  He walked away, leaving with me with my empty dishes.  Twenty minutes later, my entree arrived, not warm.  After waiting for 15 minutes and not seeing anyone, I gave up and ate it (good thing too--it was another 20 minutes before the waiter deigned to reappear).  


On my way out, saw a family with a toddler arguing with a manager about a reservation in the middle of the upstairs lobby.  Seemed I wasn't the only one having issues that night.


My overall impression is that the views are great, but not the food.  I'd save your money and either go to the bar or the observation deck alone.",Bad,Good,Bad
"I came here to see if I can get a redemption from the service. As well as make sure to enjoy the restaurant week menu. 


i had an issue with the staff about a situation where they lied in order to not get a lower tip for forgetting a order, they called me a long time after it happened and assured me that some actions were taken to avoid the same issue to happen in the future.... 


so i decided to bring my mom here as i really wanted to give them a second try and make sure that things have shifted to the better over at that place, as i do love their restaurant and the experience of being there is generally amazing. 


the service was a lot better this time and the waitress was on top of it, the drinks took forever but it seems like it was because the bar was busy, but the food was coming out in great time and she did not miss anything we ordered. 


i again didn't get to have the desert i wanted but for a different reason this time, none the less the one i did have was pretty ok. 


the restaurant week menu was a pretty good menu and well worth the experience, i am glad they are doing better now but they can get a bit better on the bar drinks speed, besides that i had a pretty average restaurant experience this time, Good and Good, pretty ok. 


this space is a majestic gem and the only reason why i do not give more stars if for the fact that, for such an amazing venue the staff and management should be striving for excellence, i still do see a average restaurant with expensive prices in a awesome location, they have ways to go but i am confident that that are on the right track.",Good,Good,Good
"Disappointed!!!! Made a reservation for a mini family reunion of three separate parties, as we checked in we were hustled over to the photo opportunity for them. We were then told there would be a wait, we were left to wander the gift shop on the ground floor.


At the restaurant, the lobby is mostly empty yet we wait. The rotating restaurant is not full, yet we wait.


The restaurant was average at best. I am quite sure based on observation that the service is based on the total bill for the table, we started with one server and as the appetizer, salads, soups, coffees and main course were ordered more and more servers came by.


I will take responsibility for the food, because I should know by now that when in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Iowa order the steak.  The menu write up is great but the taste is not there.


Lobster bisque is traditionally smooth and creamy, that means it does not have large junks of lobster in the soup. Then there is the fact the soup was way over on tomato bisque side, leading me to think that was their base.


Several at our table had Coconut Crunchy Shrimp, by definition shrimp small crustaceans, everything in Texas is not bigger especially these crunchy shrimp.  I have had better and bigger for a lot less money.


Chicken Frances was plentiful, well presented and tasty.  Too bad we didn‚Äôt all have that experience, still a little pricey.


I know they can‚Äôt control the weather and the rain did dampen the mood and hinder the view as the air conditioning fogs up the windows.


Make your reservations to ride with the sightseeing crowd for their prized seafood and steaks",Bad,Bad,Bad
Very Disappointed!!!! Made a reservation for our 36th Anniversary and when we checked in we were told there would be a 45-60 minute wait due to a 150 person overbooking of the restaurant.  This was after we had to interrupt  the hostess as she was having a casual conversation with another person as though we weren't standing in front of her.  Not even an apology or a complimentary glass of water was offered as we were told to just take a seat in an area that was over flowing with people waiting to take a seat in an area with standing room only. What's the purpose of a reservation if your treated as a walk in at the Charter House,,Bad,Bad
My husband and I took out of state guests for lunch at The Chart House at the top of The Tower of the Americas.  The service was good however the quality of the food was not up to par.  Twice one of our guests ordered something off the menu only to be told that they didn't have it available that day.  We arrived there when they opened at 11am so running out of items on your menu is unacceptable and poor planning on the part of the restaurant manager. When my meal arrived and was literally cold.  I sent it back and it was return within less than a minute later and was scorching hot which only goes to show it was stuck into a microwave to remedy the problem.  We are Landry Club Members and frequent Morton's and The Saltgrass restaurants so we had certain expectations walking in; The Chart House was nothing but an expensive disappointment.,Bad,Bad,Good
"We had dinner at the Charthouse while on a weekend getaway. Despite some of the reviews being less than stellar, we decided to take a chance.  The view was great for the first hour and a half. After that, it gets old, especially when you are hungry and still waiting for your entree. Our server was good, it did take about 20 minutes to get our drinks, which consisted of wine, water and tea. When our entrees were served, the only thing hot was my daughters baked potato. 3 steaks were room temperature, spinach was not hot. Mahi was served cold. We ordered the chocolate lava cake at the beginning of the meal, because we were told it would take 30 minute to prepare. There was nothing lava about it. It was cold and hard. We arrived at 6:45 and finally left at 9:15. Our server did not charge us for the desserts due to how long it took to get our check, which we appreciated. The view is not worth the terrible food. There are much better and equally priced restaurants in San Antonio. Very disappointing.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"My wife and I visited here during our baby moon. It was a must for dinner due to the view; however quality of the food was poor, shrimp was not deveined and my steak was  medium well when I ordered medium rare. Additionally, the crab and shrimp fondue was nothing more than a crab cheese dip.",Bad,Good,
"The view is a major part of the attraction at the Tower of the Americas, but, at the Chart House restaurant, the food is also an attractive feature.  That said, the food varies in flavor and quality, so it depends on your order.  We came for lunch and had access to both lunch and dinner menus. The crab and shrimp fondue with toasted breads was delightful.  The Diner Burger was great.  The fish and chips was a good choice.  The sweet potato fries were a good addition for $1 extra.  The shrimp tacos were just OK, but the fish tacos were among the worst we‚Äôve had.  Talk about DRY!  Then we capped it off with a great shared chocolate lava cake that was great with the vanilla ice cream and Heath Bar crunchiness.  Overall, we would return even when this simple lunch cost over $100.  The service Regina provided was very good, and the experience was indeed memorable.",Good,Good,Good
"As expected, the view was spectacular, but, big disappointment with the food. It was mediocre at best.  ""Sides"" were lukewarm; server didn't know what to do about.  Management acted concern, but could only provide slight improvement of warmed food.  No adjustment in the $145 bill.  Their attitude is ""you're a tourist and probably will never come back her.  So, it really doesn't matter whether you like it or not because there is nothing you can do about it.""  My suggestion to you would be enjoy the view ($10 admission), but find somewhere else to eat.",Bad,Good,Bad
"Couple had 1 drink each, Caesar salad, warm spinach salad, small prime rib, snapper with shrimp corn and avocado topping. $150 with tip.  A $75 meal anywhere else. So, $75 for 2+ hours with very nice ambiance through sunset til 9 pm.  Very good, attentive service. Seated within 5 minutes of arriving at reservation time. drinks and salads came quickly, entrees took about 20 min. after salads finished. Food was not hot, not cold but served on a hot plate so acceptable.  Got the impression everything is pretty much cooked in advance then put on a hot plate to finish off. Not enough avocado corn topping on the snapper, but 4 nice sized shrimp. Salads definitely seemed prepped in advance but still fine. The venue is exactly like every other roof top rotating restaurant we've been to in other cities. All and all, a nice way tyo spend an evening.",Good,Good,Good
"My prime rib was anything but prime.  It was 40 percent fat.  What was left to eat was from either the back end of an El Paso burro or a road kill armadillo. Absolutely horrible.  The accompanying horseradish sauce had less bite then a toothless cucumber and the dip was simply a dark brown sea water brine.  The garlic mashed potatoes lacked both garlic and mash.  


The view is as exciting as watching grass grow or a sloth race as the San Antonio's surrounding geography is flatter then a griddle iron.",Bad,Good,
I called to ask for parking availability and after one hour..i was told that it was on first come first. We have to walk one several blocks to get there with a baby is not easy...then our dishes had not a flavored taste at all..old and burn french fries for the birthday baby imposible to eat ..the prices are a 4 star u expect what the menu said ..our $40 dollar fish beside no flavor..it said with vegetables..and onions and tomates is the side order??? Wow at least for a $40 dollar tip that we give to this type of restaurant server we can hace an attentive and good listener server..but No . She.lack to listen how i want my otder..to end this is not a welcome restaurant for children..our birthday party was not enjoyable at all..please little bit more of light wont hurt.. was too dark-we cant take pictures.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"Be prepared to pay $15 to park in the parking lot of the Tower of the Americas. 


At dinner I placed my order and then was informed that the restaurant was out of strip steaks.  They were also out of ribeye and filet mignon.


The prime rib that I had was cooked to perfection but unfortunately was not very flavorful.  


Overall came away quite disappointed.",Bad,,
We live in downtown San Antonio and like to eat in the tower restaurant from time to time but we always go away wondering why. This time as well as times we remember in the past there are always problems that ruin the dining experience. The view is always great and I guess this is why we go back. We were a party of 6 and the service was horrible. The last dinner entry was served as they were clearing dishes from the other 5 entries and when deserts were served it was the same. The food was decent but the service kind of ruined the evening. We will probably wait a few years and go back to see the growth of San Antonio. The view is what it is about. Maybe next time just drinks and an appetizer surely they can‚Äôt mess that up??,Good,Good,Bad
"We were looking forward to having a week-day lunch at the Chart House, we'd heard great things about the view. 


We checked in at reception desk downstairs on the first floor. We were told there was no wait for lunch and that we could get right in. We were directed to the elevator and told to wait, that the elevator operator would come get us, we didn't have to press a button or anything. 


Ten minutes later we were still waiting, along with the other 10-12 people who had also gotten in line to ride up to the top. People were getting texts that their tables were ready and we couldn't even get in the elevator. 


Once we all got to the top there was this crowd of 10-12 people who all flooded out of the elevator at the same time, all asking to be seated. This created another delay, we had to wait another 5 minutes before someone could finally seat us.


The service was OK, the waiter was friendly. We ordered drinks and lunch. One of the people in our group had dietary restrictions. She specifically asked the waiter for recommendations that would fit in with those restrictions as she was having trouble finding anything on the menu. He didn't seem to know so he sent the manager over. The manager didn't seem to know, either. Neither could suggest a dish or offer to adjust a menu item to fit these restrictions. Both waiter and manager seemed relieved when, instead of getting a lunch item, she settled on an appetizer. 


It took a long time to get our food. I ordered a Parmesan crusted chicken BLT sandwich with fries. The fries were cold on arrival. When I requested hot fries it took almost as long to get replacement fries which were only warm (better than cold!).  The sandwich was not as hot as it should have been, either. It was OK. Not horrible, not stellar, just OK and certainly not worth the price. 


Between drinks and food we dropped $90 for lunch. It was a special occasion and we were willing to splurge, but there is no way I can say it was worth it when you factor everything in ‚Äì the wait for the elevator, the wait for the table, the cold food, high priced lunch menu. 


My recommendation? Go for the view. Get a cocktail and/or appetizer to justify sitting in the restaurant, watch the world go around, enjoy the view. Don't go for the food.",Bad,Good,
"We expected a little better from a Landry's branded restaurant.  I made a reservation on OpenTable and we decided to eat in the bar instead of the restaurant as it was less busy and the available seating was better.  I asked the hostess if she would still check us in on OpenTable as we would dine in the bar area instead.  She told me she would and needless to say I received and email about an hour after we left saying Chart House had canceled our reservation.  It took a couple different phone calls and people at Chart House to get this corrected.
The tuna appetizer we had was very good, tasty, and fresh.  The plantain chips that came with it were also very good.  Our bartender/server was very friendly and professional.
The view was pretty cool and I'm betting it would be even better at night.
On another note it was pretty warm inside the restaurant...not sure if that is normal or they were having AC issues.
We would probably not return to this Landry's location when we return to San Antonio as there are so many other good restaurants.",Good,Good,
This place was a big disappointment.  Kept  waiting  for a pre-booked  table.  Very  poor  selection   of  food. Ordered  a salmon dish with  rice and  steamed  vegetables. I  told the  waiter  absolutely  no  butter  because of  allergies. After a very  long  wait  the waiter  placed a plate in front of  me  and  walked away. I  thought  he'd  gone  to  get  the  rice as it  was not on my  plate. I  managed  to  get  his  attention and  asked  where  the  rice  was. Oh  you  can't  have it because  there's  butter in it I'll  get  you  more  vegetables if you  want. Well  Yes  I  would have liked a bit more  food on my  plate  but  the  thought of  waiting  30 mins or more   made  me  decline the  offer.   It  was  very  annoying  that  the  waiter  did  not come back  when  the  order was placed  and  tell  me about my  meal  and  give  me options. The   bill  was not  reduced  even  though my half  the  meal  was  not  provided. I  would  not  recommend this place.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"We went to Chart House with some friends of ours while we were in town for our anniversary.  We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation time, and although there were several tables open, they told us we would have to wait until our reservation time.  That is understandable.  We head upstairs to the bar area.  It was crowded and hot up there, so we just skipped the drinks and went back downstairs to wait.  At precisely our time, we were seated at a table by the window.  The views are amazing, and probably the only reason that a restaurant like this can even stay in business.  


We order our food and drinks.  Our server is good and very knowledgeable.  She explained each of the dishes and specials that they had.  I ordered the chef's special, and another fish dish was ordered at our table.  The two men each ordered a filet.  And this is where our problems began.  They both came out way over done.  Up until this night, I had never seen a fully cooked medium rare steak.  There was not any pink in the steaks.  Most people cannot eat a hocky puck, however, that is what was brought to our table.  Our waitress took the offending steak away, and a few minutes later the replacement showed up at our table.  Upon cutting into this one, you could almost hear it moo.  Even the manager, who was at our table knew that this was completely wrong, but tries to cover by saying that its better to undercook it because they can always go back and cook it some more.  My thinking was, its better to cook it correctly the first time, (or at least the second time) so you don't have to cook it again.  By this time, we have tried to eat as slow as we could so we could all eat together, but cold fish is not good fish so we had to finish our meals as the steaks return again.  This time, good enough to eat.  Now, normally, I would not gripe, but with the price of the steak, and a place that says it has the best steak San Antonio has to offer, it seems the problem needed to be brought up.  There should not be an excuse for any place that serves steaks at these prices to mess up a medium rare steak.  It is easily the most common way to eat a steak.  If you cannot do that right, then take steak off of your menu.  And definitely do not say you are the best.


On the other hand, the pastry chef is fabulous. We shared the creme br√ªl√©e trio and the key lime pie.  These were easily the highlight of the meal.  


Maybe we just went on an off day.  But on our anniversary, and at such an elegant place, we didn't want an off day.  By the way, they were told it was our anniversary.  The only one that even acknowledged it was the hostess checking us in.  Since the manager was at our table attending to the kitchens problems, he should have at least acknowledged it.  Especially, when our party does not get to eat dinner together.",,Good,Bad
We have reservation for 8:45 pm on Tuesday night. We were greet by the hostess with an attitude. She said we will be seat around our reservation. We got there around 8:10 pm.We waited at the bar and it was pack. We didn't get seated until 9:20 pm. We've ordered 2 Ribeye steaks and Lobster and sauteed mushrooms. The food didn't arrived till 10:10 pm. The foods was cold the steaks was over cook when we asked for medium rare and Lobster was cold and the mushrooms was cold on the sizzling plate when the next table got hot and sizzling mushrooms. The waiter don't know what the hell he's doing. We have to asked for drawn butter. What restaurant don't served drawn butter with Lobster. We're also have to asked for bread. I think he took the bread from another table because it was cold. I can go to Red Lobster and get better meals. He was so lucky I left him tips. I would not recommended it to anyone. Worst experience ever!,Bad,Bad,Bad
"READ THE END!! 


I came here last about 3 years ago to celebrate my graduation from basic military training.


I came here today to celebrate independence day with my husband. We came in earlier and went to the bar so we could enjoy some drinks while we waited for our table. Good thing is that the panoramic view made possible for us to see all fireworks happening around the city so it was great. 


Now the bar experience was not very great. We had a male and female bartender,  my husband knocked his drink out and the female didn't even clean up or said anything .... then I ordered a second drink and the bartender left the bar to talk with customers who I assume are regulars and left me hanging for a good 13 minutes. 


The bar side of this location is not impressive at all, it is small and super warm, the bar crew does not have a great hospitality or customer service skill set. 


Now the restaurant side.


The restrooms here are super small and poorly tend to.


They sat us on time, not a minute earlier.....


Our table was nice right by the window which was great we got to see fireworks from all over the city happening at all times .... The entire durs tion of our visit there was some fireworks happening somewhere. 


I had a mango mojito and that tasted amazing. 


For food we had the crab stuffer flounder, came with mash potatoes and 2! Asparagus spears. Very specific number right? 


The fish was good however I wish they were. But more generous with the crab. 


My husband had the charter house prime rib.


NOW HERE IS THE KICKER. 


We ordered a lava cake (takes 30 min to be made) we ordered with our food. 


The waitress STACY,  forgot about it. Then told us that they were sold out. As we paid the bill ,  A LAVA CAKE COMES OUT. then STACY tells us that this was the last one. We pay our bill and walk out, as we walk out, guess what... A LAVA CAKE LEAVES THE KITCHEN!!!! 


I went to ask what happened why we were not allowed to have a lava cake. The manager JULLIAN tells us that people RESERVES THE LAVA CAKES!!!! 


They went through some ridiculous excuses to cover for each other. .. I get it that comrades exists but hey, you are making the business lose customers.....  I hope the Owner sees this.",Good,Good,Bad
"Spectacular rotating view.  Food was OK.  Service was OK.  It was memorable, but pricey for the quality and the service.  I didn't mind the slow service but it would've been appropriate if the waiter had stopped by the table.",,Good,Bad
"We went to Chart House on our wedding anniversary.  We made reservations to avoid any issues, but we were late because of a metallica concert in town.  When we arrived at the restaurant, they told us it would be 15-20 minutes to be seated. When I inquired if there was a wait, we were told no, which was rather odd.  They also started taking down our information for some reason, which again seemed odd.  We then went on to go up the elevator that takes you to the restaurant which has a nice view of the city.  We initially walked up to the counter and were told it would be a few minutes of wait. Again kind of confused.  We decided to stop by the lounge to check our their happy hour. It was chaotic to say the least.  We tried finding seats and there appeared to be none, and some people who came after us happened to find seats when others left and happened to grab them which was frustrating.  I tried to grab a drink at the bar but none of the staff seemed to pay me any attention so we decided to go back down to the restaurant. Once we were seated it took a good 10+ minutes before anyone came.  Our waitress was overall nice.  The food seemed somewhat overpriced and the menu was not very impressive. I chose the savory pasta with shrimp, my husband chose the flounder dish.  After waiting more than 45 minutes, our food came out.  My food came out lukewarm at best, and it was eventually taken back and it came back warmer.  The pasta seemed rather soggy and bland, the shrimp were ok, but not great by any means.  My husband's flounder was edible, with the fish being tender and certainly more flavorful than my dish. The mashed potatoes were not creamy or particularly savory. We previously also ordered the fondue, which probably was the tastiest part of the meal.  
The view and the rotating aspect of the restaurant were probably the best part of the experience but overall lackluster at best.  
We will likely not be coming here again for dinner.  While it was not the worst meal we've had, it certainly was luckluster and average at best. For paying $27 for 5 shrimp and mushy pasta, and $31 for flounder with bland mash, we'll go elsewhere.  
We get that you are most likely paying for the view, but it would really help if the restaurant improved the food and the service. Waiting 45 minutes + for lackluster food made it the more frustrating.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The view is excellent, the service is ok and the food I think is overpriced. I was expecting a much better dinner for the price but it end up being just a normal meal. Was is worth it about this place is the view and nothing else.",Bad,Good,Good
"We had two bartenders serve us here, Brogdon and Moose. These are the names on our receipts - they are not made up. Brogdon was good, served us at about 4pm. We had a couple of Bud Lights in the bottle. Then I went back for more at about 4.40pm. This time it was Moose. I said same as last time, couple of Bud Lights in the bottle. 


Five minutes after we get served by him he brings around the happy hour menu. Not being from around here (we're from New Zealand and the accent tends to give that away to most people in the USA) we didn't know about the happy hour. I quickly saw the words Bud Light with a price significantly less than what he just charged me. I pointed this out and questioned what I was charged to which he quickly points out it's for draft beer only.


So here's my question, and the whole reason you get a one star rating, why wouldn't you point that out to someone who quite obviously is a tourist (and yes we look like tourists as well as found like them) when they order the same drinks they just had, when the clock has ticked over into happy hour and you could say 'hey, it's happy hour and drinks are half price'. The answer is obvious, I know, money. They want it from you, me and everyone else. However, the point of having a happy hour seems lost on me.


Anyway, so we sat there and enjoyed our drinks and the view. Then, instead of going to the restaurant like we'd planned to, we left and went elsewhere. Enjoy your $6 Chart House.",,Good,Bad
"This restaurant has hands down the greatest view in town. Parking is $11 and is good all day. If you weto the Observation Deck you'd be paying $12 per adult or free to the restaurant. It is a revolving restaurant. 
It always helps things go smoothly when you have a reservation. I used OpenTable and got 100 points. 
If you don't know much about OpenTable you can get anywhere from 100-1000 points per reservation. You can redeem for gift cards especially for a participating restaurant of your choosing. I am going to eat at many of the places on OpenTable anyway, why not get a bigger bang for your buck. I've already gotten a $100 gift card and now working towards a $200 one. 
Back to the restaurant, even though I had a reservation I still had to wait about 10 minutes even though the restaurant was pretty empty. 
I was contemplating between the Shrimp, Crab, Avocado and Mango Stack $16.50 or the Lobster Bisque $11. They were out of the Shrimp, Crab, Avocado and Mango Stack so it made for an easy choice of the Lobster Bisque. The Lobster Bisque was great. Although, it would have been nice if the restaurant served bread prior to that is common amongst most high end restaurants. So that was a pretty decent strike in addition to the wait after reservations. Although, nothing major. Yes, the service was slow, but the quiet and view made up for it. 
I then ordered the Mac Nut Mahi $40. I asked the waiter his opinion and his opinion was unfortunately not his own. He doesn't eat seafood. It's my opinion that all staff try and have knowledge of every dish on the menu. So, when asked for a recommendation they can honestly give their own opinion from their own experience. 
The Mac Nut Mahi was great. The peanut sauce was a great complement to the macadamia nut crust on the Mahi and went well with the mango sticky rice and Asian green beans. The mango relish could have been better had they used a more ripe mango. The mango used wasn't quite ready. And the fresh onions added too much of a spice. If they wanted to improve a blend of spices, texture and flavor saut√©ed or caramelized onions would have improved the relish. Overall a good and unique dish that can be improved. 
I finished off with the Hot Chocolate Lava Cake $12. I was terribly disappointed. It is supposed to be their signature dessert. Now, I am not sure if I just had a bad batch, or it was a different chef in the kitchen, but this was unfortunately the worst Chocolate Lava Cake I've ever had. It was by no means moist. It was overcooked and where's the molten center . There were even crunchy parts of the cake outside of the heath bar ingredients. So, it's either I had a bad batch, or many people haven't had the privilege of having great chocolate Lava Cake. I've had this dessert in various countries throughout the world to include third world countries where the price of this $12 dessert would be the cost of the entire bill and the others were better. 
I would seriously look into the making of the Lava Cake. You can even see in the video that there is no molten center. My overall experience was average. But I can't say I'd recommend this place outside of the view from my experience. My favorite thing was the lobster bisque and the Mac Nut Mahi. Although, the Mahi itself wasn't the same. Perhaps, that particular opinion is biased because I've had fresh caught Mahi Mahi from my time in Hawaii.",,Good,Bad
"Our server delivered a dessert with nuts on it to our table, even though we expressly told him I have a severe nut allergy prior to ordering the dessert. I noticed something on the top that looked like nuts so I asked what it was. It was a good thing I saw this before I took a bite!  
When we told him again that I was allergic to nuts and asked for a replacement, he simply said that if I was allergic I should definitely stay away from the dessert, and he walked away! I have since contacted the Chart House as well as Landry's Select Club (we have been members for a while) and as of today, over 3 weeks later, I still have had no response from anyone. An issue this serious really should be addressed, the next customer may not be so lucky. We will not be going back.
In addition to the allergy issue, we waited a long time for our reserved table. We had to ask twice for the bread that they bring to your table, we had to ask for our salad, and had to ask another server for refills on our drinks. Our server seemed completely uninterested in being there and even less interested in providing a Good.",,,Bad
"About 10 of us (group of friends with kids) thought that capping our day off with a visit here would be a fun idea. Reservations were for 8pm mid-week. We arrived at 7:55 and waited about 10 minutes for our table, no big deal.  We marveled at the views of the city at sunset.


Once we were seated, my husband ordered a beer & I ordered a Pear-Rita. It took SO long for our drinks that I thought they forgot we ordered them. When the beer finally came but not my drink I said, "".....and I have a Pear-Rita coming..."" The waitress responded, ""Oh, right, they started to make the wrong one and are re-making yours."" (Why couldn't she have just told me this was the reason for the long wait).


When my drink finally came I noticed right away that it lacked the ""apple foam and salted rim"" I read about in the description. There was about 1/2"" of nothing between rim and liquid, and I turned around to tell her, but she was gone. Took a LONG while for her to return.  I got tired of looking at it so I took a sip - It was pretty good, but I was perplexed as to why they would serve something ""not right"". When she did return I said, ""I think this should have apple foam and salted rim....."" Without hesitating she said matter-of-factly, ""Oh right, they said they were out of the foam.""   Wow.   I was really taken aback. (Why didn't she explain that when she served the drink instead of plopping it down then walking away). Also.... isn't the ""foam"" made of egg whites? What does that even mean, ""out of the foam"".... But I am not a picky customer and I had indeed been sipping it, so when she asked me if I wanted another drink I said ""no"". 


It took FOREVER for our food to come - We ordered salmon, salads, food for the kids, appetizers, etc. etc. and had even put in an order for the lava cake right when we sat down since it said that it ""needs 30 minutes of lead time"".  Things came to the table in random order.


As we waited and ate / shared what was being served, we all realized how COLD the restaurant was, and since it rotated, there was a section where the cold air blew right on us, which we all dreaded.  Really cold, uncomfortably cold. 


With our meal dragging out, and us being cold,  the kids got anxious and got up and down from their seats but stayed near our table. They were being relatively good since it was now approaching 10pm.  The 2-year old sat in her high chair without making a peep the whole time. It was the 6yr old and 10 yr olds that were fidgety (and frankly so were the  adults). 


The food came out and we had ordered salmon plus the extra toppings.  The ""extra topping and the rice that said should be served family style"" were miniscule. Very deceiving, and we paid extra for this. 


The reason I did not give this review a 1-star is because the food that we had was very good. Not what we expected and out-of-order, but very good once it got to us (except for my strange drink). 


Finally everyone ate our meals and while we were waiting for the lava cake some of us ordered the peanut butter ice cream. 


OH MY GOODNESS there a LONG wait here....who knows why, because we put in the order for the lava cake when we sat down at 8:10pm, and it was now around 10:30pm. I joked that ""why is taking so long when we put the lava cake order in 2+ hours ago.... surely all they need to do is scoop the ice cream into a bowl for the rest of us...."" 


Finally the waitress came out (no lava cake yet) and said, ""Sorry, but we are out of the peanut butter ice cream."" OH MY GOODNESS why did this take so long to tell us?! By now I was DONE - Tired, cranky, cold, frustrated - And so were the others. We did not order any other ice cream or any other dessert, we waited for the lava cake and our checks then boarded the elevator at ~10:50pm. 


Here's the thing that topped it off.....Many of the staff were leaving around this same time and so folks with their uniforms on were leaving with us.  A staff person with a uniform on STOOD AT THE WINDOW of the elevator, right in the middle, blocking the view so that some of the kids and us adults could not see very well. Now surely this is an elevator that she has ridden up and down several times a week for nearly a year (she told us she started last summer). Here WE are, visiting this place for the first (and most likely the last) times in our lives. And.....the view and the elevator ride is kind of a big deal....The kids had to crowd near her and I tried my best to see out, but gave up, and thinking about it further, it really irked me, that after a long, cold, frustrating dinner, this is how the night ended - With a staff person blocking ""the best view"" in San Antonio on the elevator ride down.",Good,Bad,Bad
"The wife and I made a reservation for 445 pm,knowing that later would be long,
It was our 8 th anniversary of our marriage ,
We have been members of Tillmans , and his restaurants for over 20 years


The Elevator was a long wait,about 20 minutes and over crowded,when we got to The Resturant (chart house)
Upon Arival at the host desk,we were told it would be 10 more minutes,well after 25 minutes ,I asked them about our reservations for 445pm, wich was 15 min past ,and there was very little customers there,They sat us right away
The overpriced,very lacking menu was not what I expected fro a aTillmans Resturant ,


After a long wait for our meal the wife ordered and received her Salmon,as I was still waiting for my steak,
When our Hostes came back I asked her about my steak ,she rolled her eyes around with a question mark in her thoughts,peered around and seen my steak and the fixings 
On some one else's tablew


I was very upset,but kept calm,really freaked out about being a long time customer of the Chain,Being a card holder,Supposed to be a high end Resturant, ect,


We ended up with my wife eating,and myself eating dinner rolls,I will never ever step foot in this over priced,limited menu and especially employs that didn't live up to the standards of an elite Resturant 


For our anniversary it was ruined,please please you all beware !!!


We will still visit the other Landrys team restaurants but not this one,until we get a formal apology from Tillman Fertita team,

"We went on a Monday evening-- the restaurant and bar were closed even though their hours are from 11 AM - 10 PM. I wasn't planning on dining at the chain anyways, but would have enjoyed a drink or two.",,,
"I am normally a fairly positive poster, but other than the view, I have nothing positive to say about the lunch.  Dirty glasses, cups, and plates.  Not exaggerating!  Snapper was so over-cooked, it was mush. My wife's salad was completely wilted like the lettuce had been chopped the day before. My daughter's medium rare filet was well done.  There were only 3 other tables occupied, yet the lunch took over an hour to get to us.  $150 for the worst food we have had in San Antonio.  You have to pay $12/person just to ride the elevator up to it.  Just a shame. Would never, ever recommend it.",Bad,Good,Bad
"We have been Landry's select members for years. I have never had such an awful experience at any Landry's restaurant as this Chart House in the tower. The view is outstanding. But, you could get that on the observation deck and not have to suffer through this meal. Three hours to eat lunch. Three. It took over an hour to be seated with the ""preferred seating"" for select members which we were told had a fifteen minute wait. Once we were sat, it took another hour and ten minutes to receive our food. In that time, the waitress could not even be bothered to refill drinks even once. And if you would like to know about the food, it was cold when served. The bathrooms had no paper towels and had filth in the floors. We never saw a manager of any kind, which in every dining experience we have ever had with Landry's select the manager comes and visits and greets you and speaks to you directly. Had we seen one, I would have voiced the shock at the state of the restaurant, but my guess is they do not care which is why it was in this state, poor management. This was far more than one poor waitress. I was shocked because it was truly terrible.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The view of the city and the food almost makes this worth it. The food was actually very good - my salad was delicious, the calamari was piled high, and my friend loved her soup. The low rating came from the service. While I understand we chose to dine in the restaurant instead of just grabbing a drink at the bar, we arrived at 4pm so we wouldn't take up tables from full on paying dinner guests.  Our first drinks were great, but we felt our server was really pushy. I ordered my second drink, a dirty martini that I was positive the bartender made with a flavored vodka (cherry was my guess?) and it was awful. I asked for a new one using different vodka, and the second one came out exactly the same. Tasted terrible! When he brought out my 2nd drink, he brought another one for my friend who never requested it, nor did she want it. Drinks are $12-$16 each and she felt obligated to drink it because he brought it to the table. He pushed the chocolate cake dessert very hard to where we had to say no multiple times, and then even trying to pay we were pushed to join some loyalty club even tho he knew we were visiting from out of town. We were a little discouraged that at such a high end place no manager came around to touch tables and check in. Overall, I would eat there again even tho it's very pricey but would request a new server.",Good,Good,Bad
I love the parent company of Landry's so I was excited to visit.  The waiter was attentive and the view was great but the food was just average for a not average price.,Bad,Good,Good
"I decided to go up to the bar for a quick appetizer and drink and it took 1 hour and 45 minutes.  I had to wait a very long time for everything.  It took at least 15 minutes for my server to come over and greet me.  I had looked ahead on the menu and knew what I wanted but she was not ready for my order.  When she did finally come back, they were out of what I wanted and so I had to look at the menu after all.  It took forever for my draft beer to come and when I got my food (later than everyone around me) it looked like it was thrown on the plate and one of the sliders had 1/2 of the meat off the bun.  I had no silverware or napkin and had to go to the bar to get my own.  It truly was a terrible experience from top to bottom.  The waitress was clearly overbooked and had no chance of giving people Good.  As I looked around the bar, everyone was waiting for something (drink refill, check, food, another round etc).  The waitress was kind and knew that I was not happy and apologized for the mixup with my food as it took longer than everyone else's and she comped my bill.  I would think that on a Saturday afternoon they should know it would be busy and have enough staff.  My negative review is really for the management and not the staff that was working.  I live in Seattle and I would never expect that kind of service at the Space Needle.",Bad,Bad,
"Waiter brought out appetizers and then proceeded to bring out next course prior to finishing our appetizers.  We requested that soup be hot but when it arrived it was Luke warm.  The room was very cold in our section and this was brought to the attention of our waiter three times but the issue was never addressed.  Finally, since it was very cold in our section of the restaurant,, the waiter was asked to bring containers for the unfinished food but we had to ask our waiter three times in order to get these containers.",,Bad,Bad
"We had a ""nice"" dinner here. Service was hot and cold, sometimes attentive and sometimes missing.

"We were here on Sat. Had 2:30 reservations. Arrived at 2:10 & were seated immediatly. We thought it was great. Then, our waiter came to the table. He was a very young man who was a nice kid, but should have NEVER been working in a restaurant that is supposed to be of this caliber!  He was Terrible. Terrible, did I mention, TERRIBLE!! He took our order,brought our drinks in about ten minutes (there was only about 6 other people in the whole restaurant at this time of day). I asked for a couple pieces of lemon for my water & never received them until I had to ask again when our food came. He never brought our bread/ butter, in fact we never seen him I between the time we ordered our food until it was delivered by him & another young man. The food was Excellent. But, at that price, we figured that it should be. We never seen him again until he brought us the dessert that we ordered when we placed our original food order. Never came back to ask if we wanted more drinks/ water, NOTHING! Then he came later & dropped the bill on the table & said "" hope you liked the food"" !!   I said we never got bread/ salad or nothing else.  He said, & I quote ""Well, you never asked for it"" !!! WOW !!  We dropped $110.00 & we're very dissatisfied to say the least. We told the hostess about it & she (also a very young girl) just shrugged it off.  I have no problem using young people, but I suggest you either train them or have supervision so these young kids understand the Need to take care of people properly when they are spending this kind of money on a dinner. We will NEVER go back there. The food was EXCELLENT, the service TERRIBLE. Congrats to the chef, shame on the owner for using young kids to do the work of a trained adult. This place is supposed to be five star restaurant, I would give it a minus 3 !!  If you go, ask for a trained wait person.",Good,,Bad
"We ate here for my birthday this weekend, and we were nothing but disappointed. It took 20 minutes after we were seated for the waiter to take our drink orders. Then it took 10 minutes to get our drinks - and they were both wrong! My glass of wine had crumbs in it, and the replacement wasn't what I ordered - and the glass they charged me for was twice as expensive. After that, the soup they served us was cold, and when I asked them to not replace it - they still brought it out and charged us for it. Given the amount of money you spend on a meal here, the service was awful and the quality of the food definitely did not justify it. My sense was that they took too many reservations and didn't have the staff to really make it a Good.",Bad,,Bad
"We went out to try this Friday night for date night with my lovely  and left with the impression of never going back. Service sucked, food was average and the view was great. Oh and don't order an old fashion you will get a whiskey snow cone. Way better options out there and most importantly service at a lesser cost.",,Good,Bad
"We went to the bar for happy hour and MY WIFE'S JACKET WASL STOLEN from the back of her chair while sitting at the bar! Be very careful here. The manager didn't seem to be too interested either. Besides that, of course the view is great, but the bar service was really slow and we often had to ask twice for drinks.",,Good,Bad

"My husband and I decided to stop at the Tower at 7:00 pm and have a drink and appetizers after a long day.  We sat at the bar for at least 5 min. before the bartender ""Sergio"" greeted us or took our drink order.  We ordered sliders w/ french fries and oysters for appetizers. When our food order came out, the fries were cold, not warm, COLD, I asked Sergio to get us some fresh, warm fries.  He removed the fries from the bar and returned with THE SAME FRIES...MICRO-WAVED!


Since Sergio did not care about my request, I did not make any comments to him about my disappointment in the fact that now I had warm HARD fries, instead of FRESH WARM FRIES. I went to the restaurant to speak to a manager.  It took the hostess and a few of the servers a while to find ""Steve"", the manager on duty.  


I explained the situation to Steve, he apologized and said he would make sure that we got fresh trench fries right away.  After 45 min. and no fries, we decided to leave.
We never received our fries, Sergio was aware that I had spoken to Steve and did not attempt to apologize or follow up.  When we asked for our check, the sliders were on the check (even though Sergio knew that we never received our fries, and that I had spoken to the manager on duty.) Sergio could have cared less.  I informed Sergio that I was not paying for sliders and I wanted him to take the cost off the bill.  He promptly adjusted the bill with no apology.


Before leaving I asked to speak to Steve again - when Steve came to the bar, I asked Steve about the fries, he looked stunned and said that Sergio was supposed to bring them out.  I explained that I never received the fries, and that I would have expected him (Steve) to follow up, not Sergio.  He was the problem in the fist place.  I explained to Steve that staff usually takes the lead from management; if management does not lead by example and follow through when poor service is an issue, then typically  the employees don't either, especially in this day and age.


The Tower is iconic in San Antonio.  it is unfortunate that one of our biggest tourist  city draws is managed by an organization that does not provide hospitable service that San Antonio is known for.  The staff/management mentally is that folks are going to visit the Tower no matter what, because of its history - so  good customer service/experience is not a priority.  I encourage you to read other review before you visit the restaurant or bar at the tower.  Visit the observation deck, then eat and drink on the River-walk, because you will have a bad, costly experience at the Chart House or Bar 601 located in the Tower.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I had dinner with my family and friend last nigh. Beautiful view , but you have to see it trough dirty windows with many fingerprints and god knows what else.Restrooms filthy dirty. The bar upstairs was very dirty too, with leftover food and no bar mats.Dont ask about the hoststand , it was looking like a gipsey wagon. The server didnt introduce himself, he didnt reccomend us any plate,wine or specials, never ask for Landrys select club and etc. The forks were bended, the bread came after the salads and appettizers. The lettuce in my cesar salad were old. Nobody offered me pepper and sherry for my lobster bisk. We had to look for the server when we need him, he never was around. The manager never came to the table to greed us and ask if everything is ok.The food was ready 50 mins after we ordered it and the restaurant was empty. I ordered medium-rare ribeye  it came out well done , the mashed potatoes were cold and my lobster mac n cheese was cold too and i didnt see any lobster in it. I asked for the manager and finally she showed up , dressed unproffesional for the landrys standarts, she was looking like is her 1st day so as the server. The manager never ask us , if we are members of the select club . Big dissapointment , Bad and service. For the location and the name of the company they have to do better , this place doesnt worth high prices in the menu. The best thing was the exit door.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Sorry...but the food and service seemed cut rate. The view and novelty of being up on the tower is kinda cool, but i'm not sure what happened to this outfit.  if this is the Chart House that has multiple locations, it was a letdown. 
The food wasn't hot and - i don't know how to do this without being overly harsh - but it was on par with a Happy Steak or Sizzler. And they weren't overly selective on their servers. 


Don't bother getting anything on the pricier end, because none of it was worth the price.  Morton's, Ruth's Chris, or almost any other place for steak or seafood will be a better deal, even at much higher prices, 


So just know what you are getting into and then there won't be any surprise.  It's kind fun to take the elevator up there are a few things you can do on the tower besides eat.",Bad,Good,Bad
"We got an evening reservation to watch the sunset and see the lights of the city after dark.  The views are great and well worth the trip to the restaurant.  Our food was good, but the service could be much better.  We were told after appetizer and salad that one item on the menu was not available that night.  We had to choose something else, which delayed our entrees. Overall, the service was slow.  When the manager came by, we told him what happened.  The response we got was only that he was going to find out what happened.  There was not offer to compensate for the poor service.  Someone traveling on business who was sitting near us waited at her table for 30 minutes without being greeted by a waiter or having her order taken.  Again the manager fell short in responding to the situation when she decided to get up and leave.  She left without dinner, not wanting to deal with the situation any longer.  In sum, you can have great views and Good; but you might have to put up with poor service.",Good,Good,Bad
"I'm a corporate executive chef. You couldn't pay me to eat their food ever again. Spent over $200 for no bread at table, water to drink, cold vegetables(broccoli) on a $30+ plate. Pretty much entire meal was cold. Presentation of plates? My appetite & expectations were lost as plate presented. No steam!!!! 
Flavorless besides salt & gingered rice. Didn't eat.
Waiter didn't offer dessert. Brought check placed on table.  I have never once thought of walking a check..but the thought of absolute disgust of this meal. $200+ for 4.

"We arrived Thursday night 6:15 the Thursday before Christmas. We arrived a little early so you went to the bar above the restaurant ordered some drinks and found out that they were out of tonic water. We went on with our drinks sit down and have dinner our waitress Julie did a fine job we ordered our entrees and told they're out of tuna. Once again we substituted and pressed on after dinner we decided have coffee the wife ordered decaf surprise again no decaf, so we substituted for the third time only to find out the coffee was cold. So I went to talk to the manager and he was unaware of any of this said he was going to get to the bottom of it. The food was good the wait staff was fantastic The View was perfect it's just extremely poor management should be out of items on a holiday weekend of course we all have bad days",Good,Good,
"If your appetite survives the $15 charge to park at the tower of the Americas, just tuck your patience in your pocket, think happy thoughts and wait for the disinterested and put out staff at the Chart House to test your feelings of self worth. Strike one  was the overwhelming challenge of the staff to fill a glass with ice water. Strike two was the wilted salad and cold soup. Strike three was the promise to bring their customized ""Happy birthday"" menus the gave my wife when we were seated. They did not return them to us. Strike four was when we left, they looked at us like we were scum for not accepting their incompetence with good grace. I'm sorry, but perhaps they should update their website with a reminder that they are doing you, the customer, a favor for the honor of sitting at a table in your restaurant.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had no intentions to go up in the Tower of the Americas. We received the dinner promotion for a timeshare presentation. The menu was somewhat limited and the wait staff seemed untrained and inexperienced. The meals were okay but not spectacular. The revolving restaurant did not revolve due to mechanical issues and we left feeling underwhelmed. The night sky was overcast with foggy patches blocking the view, which was no one's fault. You can spend your culinary budget in a lot better places. Wait for a clear day to go up in the tower for the city sights.",,Bad,Bad
"As locals we wanted to visit for some time but finding a reservation had been difficult. We finally decided to plan in advance and made a reservation a month out. We arrived early and planned to have a drink at the bar. Unfortunately the bar area was understaffed and one group of 15 dominated the servers attention. We sat for 15 minutes before we had our drink order taken. The drinks made it to our table as we were heading downstairs to be seated. The drinks though were tasty and we would have had a second had service been even mediocre. 


The hostess presented me with and envelope as we were seated which turned out to be a birthday card signed by 10 or so of the staff. Quite a nice touch. Our waiter was top notch but sadly the food wasn't. Room temperature sides and just ok mains. Based on our experience I would suggest ordering beef or chicken as the fish was not that good. 


Sadly we will not be back unless it is for happy hour and to sit at the actual bar, not in the bar area.",Bad,,Bad
We are locals that haven't been to Chart House and thought it would be fun to celebrate my husband's birthday. We made a reservation and we promptly seated to a great view!

"We've loved this restaurant in the past but what a disappointment when the 6 of us visited last Thursday evening. First, we waited for 40 minutes for the elevator, then were seated where we could not see and absolutely froze during dinner. (We weren't the only diners who were cold. Others were wrapped in table linens while eating.) We spoke to the manager, Steve, twice but nothing changed nor were there any attempts at compensation. Our food was tasty, but, as you can guess, cold. Our waitress, Melissa, was trying hard to please us, but it wasn't her fault. We spent close to $400 for our combined dinners, but it was wasted money in our estimation.  There are many fine places to dine in San Antonio: you can do so much better than Chart House based upon our experience.",Bad,Bad,
"We stopped in for lunch, there wasn't anyone in the lobby, but we were told it would be a 20 minute wait - it ended up being a 35 minute wait, once we were seated it took 20 minutes for the server to come to the table. I asked for hot tea and he said he would bring me a a basket of choices, several minutes later, he showed up with two teabags.....he then put the pot on his station and left - I had to get up and get my own tea or it would have been cold waiting for him to bring it to me.  It took 30 minutes for the food to arrive - it was excellent.  We also had dessert which was wonderful.  It took another 15 minutes for the check to arrive.  Even though the food was very good, waiting for 3 hours is not what we wanted to do while trying to see some of the other sights in San Antonio.",Good,,Bad
"Personally, I had this experience to compare with Stratosphere so it sets a bar.  


Had a reservation that we still had to ""wait"" for.  Without an offer of going to the bar upstairs.  Then upon sitting it took 11 min for service and we got cocktails before water.  


Lobster Bisque was to die for - could have ended there.  I had the stuffed flounder.  It was good.  The lump of potatoes were ice cold (yuck).  My friend got a Ribeye and it was cooked perfectly but again, ice cold potatoes.  


The bill was odd because the waiter tries to sell you a Landrys discount card.  And really pushes it even after saying no!  


Nice view but I would just pay $12 for observation tower.",Good,Good,Bad
"We went here for lunch on a Monday. It's expensive but you would expect that given the location atop the Tower of the Americas. Food was ok, good but not excellent. Beer selection was pitiful. Waiter was fine but he delivered our bill charging the dinner prices till I questioned him. The main reason you go here is for the outstanding rotating view of the city. The windows were dirty. There was smudges, smears and streaks on the inside of the glass. The ledge below the glass was messy too with various pieces of stuff including a shard of glass, all slowly rotating I front of your view. Why would an upscale place like this allow such basic daily maintenance to be missed? Poor management seems to be the answer.",,Bad,Bad
"Too expensive!!! 3 shrimp and 3 scallops was $37. You know how many shrimp and scallops I can buy at the grocery store for $37??? A mixed drink was $12. A baked potato was $3 extra. All told $100, oh yeah, plus a $20 tip. Our waiter made $50 in tips at our table alone.  I want to work there!!",Bad,,Bad
"We have dined every year at the Chart House at the Tower of Americas. Every year it is the same story: nice view, great sunset, super slow service and just okay food. When it happens once, you forgive. When it happens 5 times, it is time to eat elsewhere. If you want to take the kids, go during the day and get a burger. It is a hot spot for businesses to entertain large parties and you get forgotten. We went each time as a romantic evening. It was but not a great dinner. It is accessible by wheelchair but the restrooms would be difficult.",,Good,Bad
"I am in San Antonio for a conference and decided to try Chart House for lunch. I am originally from Seattle so I was eager to compare it to my experiences at the Space Needle. The view is fantastic, definitely recommend sitting towards the way you rotate. The food was delicious, and picture perfect. The reason this review gets only a 3 is due to the service. I did not have a reservation, and the hostesses looked at me like I was crazy for coming in without one. So I get seated after a few minutes, and am greeted after a few minutes. My server seemed tired, or not excited to be here. Coming from the service industry, I asked for recommendations and was only given an ""it's good"" if I asked specifically about an item. Then the appetizer came (a free one for being at the conference). When I was finished, no one cleared my appetizer plates. Then the expo brought my lunch, and did not take my appetizer still. The waitress walked by my table multiple times without taking my plate or asking how the food was. When I was finished with my food completely, she mouthed if I wanted the check, to which I said yes, and STILL didn't take my dirty plates. Now while I believe that sometimes things happen and I know people get busy, but she is not. It's obvious. For as fancy and expensive as the menu is I just expected better. Even the check and payment took way longer than it should have. Definitely not impressed (even for as good as the food was).",Good,Good,Bad
"Ok, I feel like I ordered the wrong thing and that the food is really much better than my experience.  I had the stuffed flounder which was meh, unfortunately my wife had the same thing so I can't tell you first hand that something else is excellent.  I did talk to a family who sat next to us with 3 young kids and they go there once a month and love the food, he was eating a steak, I forget what she was having.  The reason to go, from my perspective, was the view.  I love rotating restaurants and this was no exception.  Make reservations!!! If you don't I doubt you will get to eat.  Even with reservations we had to wait for 30 or so min which was a little annoying.  The staff is friendly and responsive.
One note, that may be obvious to everyone but me, when you have reservations to eat there you don't have to wait in line.  Just walk past the line, walk over to the restaurant desk to confirm your reservation, and then get in the much shorter line for the elevator to the restaurant.
While you wait they have a nice bar with friendly staff where you can sit and have a drink.  We weren't in the mood for a drink and they were still friendly, if a little annoyed.",Bad,Good,
"Expecting a nice dinner at the Chart house, towers of America.   Birthday for my wife of 34 years. 


San Antonio is full of nice folks. Riverwalk, omni hotel great, tours, attractions all good. 


Nice meal selection at the restaurant. My wife ordered a before dinner drink. Be sure if you get Hector to ask for bread. I asked him after dinner and he said it was only available upon request. When he left, I asked 2 others servers and they said it was standard and immediately offered to go get it for us - again being at the end of dinner we declined. 


When Hector came back with my wife's drink it was watered down he mumbled something about the bartenders. 


We ordered dinner a bit later. I ordered a drink and ordered another for the birthday gal. 


Hector came back to inform us they were out of the 9 oz filet so he ordered the 7 oz for us. My wife said yes - he never looked at or asked me - just walked off.  That was a challenge for me as I had almost ordered seafood. 


Shortly afterwards we ran out of water. Hector brought my drink but not my wife's. He said he was waiting on her to tell him she wanted it. I explained we ordered both at the same time no you didn't. 


After another 10 minutes or more my wife caught the eye of the manager, Blake. He took care of the drink situation quickly.   Hector eventually made it back to the table to again bash the bartenders. 


I challenged him that he did want to take responsibility for anything. He got extremely upset looking ready to fight. 


We saw Blake and my wife did her best to explain the entire thing. She broke down in tears, I finished. 


Blake was great and handled the situation. 


Please NEVER accept Hector as your waiter. Horrible.",Good,,Bad
"The atmosphere was great.  The views were peaceful and relaxing.  However,  the service and food were ok pretty average but you are going for the view.  The price was $150 for family of 4 for lunch on a Saturday.  Try their deserts they looked great.",,Good,
"Food arrived cold.
Three requests for tea went Unattended.
Baked potato cold. Butter did not melt.
Flounder was Lukewarm.
Very poor service.",Bad,,Bad
"Had dinner here and was warned that the food wasn't amazing. I could have just had drinks there and been perfectly happy. The drinks were pretty good. I had a mango mojito and my husband had the pomegranate version. We each ordered a salad. He got the watermelon salad and I got the chopped salad. My salad was pretty good minus the boxed croutons it came with. It was really too big for an appetizer salad. By the time my prime rib arrived, I was pretty full. My prime rib was okay. Not a lot of flavor and overcooked. They were also skimpy on the au jus. The garlic Yukon mashed potatoes that accompanied the prime rib were kind of bland and had skins in them. Yuck! Hate skins in my mashed potatoes. My husband had the new York strip. For dessert we shared the chocolate molten lava cake with a scoop of homemade peanut butter ice cream. Both were amazing. If you go, save yourself $15 and try to park on the street if you can. They don't validate parking.",Bad,,
Went for lunch and had table next to window.  We arrived early for our reservation and were seated immediately.   The service was very good but the food wasn't spectacular.   It's a nice to do for the view.  Most likely won't return if we ever travel back to San Antonio.,Bad,Good,Good
"Not sure where to begin on the poor experience. From waiting 45 min to be seated for reservation - still think this is a racket to drive sales for the bar, to almost non existent service after we were seated. Sea bass adequate at best - at get this...pan seared was an extra $6?  Guess raw is the advertised price? 
We live in SA. Trust me, I will NEVER recommend this place!! Couldn't even get a manage to stop by table. What a joke. And a shame for the fantastic location. This was a one and only flame out of epic proportion - and for our anniversary dinner. Sucks!!!!  Would give it less than one star if possible.",,Bad,Bad
"We were lucky enough to get a last minute reservation. As out of towners, I was excited to dine with a great view of this city. We arrived and waited about 5-10 minutes in line for the first host encounter. Many people did not have reservations and were in line to determine if they could get in. Then we were moved to the elevator line to go up to the restaurant, and that was about a 10 minute wait. We were greeted by hostesses who, to me, felt annoyed at the large crowd this evening. After officially checking in, we waited at the bar for 45 minutes after our reservation time for a table to be made available. Serge and Angel were attentive and engaging bar tenders. The Monarch margarita was weak, in my opinion, but deliciously fruity. The Fleur D'Lis (Midori-Based Drink) was on point. Once seated at our table by a blond hostess who was energetic and engaged, I believe we got sat at the same as the large table next to us and our server Nick was ""in the weeds"" at the beginning. He recovered quickly though. The most disappointing thing was that they were out of 4 white wines I selected. They were also out of the chicken dish I selected (1 of only 2 chicken dishes on the menu). The other chicken dish, chicken francese, was as bland as paper, sadly. No flavors at all. BUT the 14oz ribeye cooked to medium plus was absolute perfection- tender and full of flavor. The garlic mashed potatoes were delicious. Thankfully, Nick comp'd the chicken dish and that made us feel better. Overall, the service was slower than you would hope, and the general feeling from half of the employees was lack of care and appreciation for our business. On the fence about visiting again in the future. The view may not make up for the hit or miss service.",Bad,Good,
"We knew from the outset that you weren't going to find the best food in San Antonio at the top of Tower of the Americas, but that's not really why you go, you know? The views are amazing and our kids were mesmerized by the moving floor. It's considered fine dining, but I saw guests in there in shorts and t-shirts, and they had an established kids menu. It's not cheap, though! My husband and I weren't too impressed with our seafood entrees-stuffed flounder and grilled tuna-and it seemed like low quality for the price. But, if you are looking for the best views of the city, you can't beat this place.",Bad,Good,
The food is very good. Staff are very polite but service is way to slow. Dinner was almost 2 hours later than the reservation. Nothing like having a meal served at 10:30 at night. Really no apology for the inconvenience. Prices steep.,Good,,Bad
"Do not go to this restaurant if you plan to be seated in less than an hour even with a reservation. We waited for 1.5 hours for a table and didn't get seated until we asked. We ended the evening which was supposed to be a rare couple's night out by missing a show that we had paid $40 per ticket to see. Oh, the manager did say he was sorry after we asked to see him right before we left the restaurant. He admitted he'd been made aware of the situation but he didn't seem to care nor did he willingly come to our table to speak to us. This is the only restaurant in San Antonio that I have not had a manager come by my table to ensure we were happy. And if you're looking for Good there are much better places for the price albeit you don't get the view. Happily our waiter James was very nice and accommodating. I did make sure to let our taxi driver know not to recommend this restaurant and will be sure to let others know as well.",,Good,
We had allotted time to enjoy a leisurely lunch and view the sites of San Antonio from the Hemisphere. But the service here was so slow we were late in returning to our convention. We ordered sandwiches and key lime pie which were good.,Good,Good,Bad
"We ate there for dinner tonight for Father's Day. 4 people ate for $175 with no special drinks and no desserts. Sure the views are amazing and we had a great time. Parking was $11 also. Service was average. It's great to do one time or for extreme special occasion, like a marriage proposal, but after that, I don't think so. My husband had cedar plank salmon and he said it was good. I got a salad, and two other sides. Couldn't eat the salad because it had way too much onion powder. My father in law enjoyed the filet mignon very much. The bottom line is, it's a Good, but don't go for great food.",,Good,
"Comparing this to other landmark restaurants this place is average. Comparing to other Chart House or Landry's properties I would have to rate at slightly below that. The views are spectacular so that is a given and should justify a cost surcharge. The restaurant level rotates (~once/hour) with split level seating so good views from just about every seat.


The food very disappointing for a Chart House location. The chop salad was brownish from the balsamic vinegar dressing and obviously the ""chopping"" had taken it's toll on the vegetables. Steaks were good but the sides were uninspired and not at all well plated. 


Our waitperson was pleasant in a Siri/robotic kind of way. When I asked what she would recommend or what she usually ate she quoted the menu test almost word for word. She was efficient but lacked any of the Texas charm we'd encountered elsewhere. It wasn't busy at all so it wasn't like she was rushed for time. She gave me the impression that she knew the minimal amount to provide a basic service and wasn't going to put much more into it.


A minor gripe is the very poor quality ceiling speakers playing tinny pop-rock throughout the meal. The sonic equivalent of AM radio detracted from the experience.  The hanging lights are retro-cool.


The view is great. San Antonio doesn't have the downtown density to really sparkle but you can see how far the city extends and it also gives a great view of the great homes in the King William Historic District.


Parking is close to the base of the tower. $8 the day we went but the other side of the sign said $11 so it must change. No parking validation by the restaurant. Check in for the restaurant is on the east side of the base away from observation desk elevator.",Bad,Good,Bad
"We had a reservation but we still had to wait around 30 minutes to be seated, then had to wait approximately 20 more minutes for our food.


The only good thing about them, the view from up there is marvelous!",,Good,Bad
Had lunch in this revolving restaurant which provided a quiet hideaway from sightseeing.   Food was good.   Of particular note was the ice cream which we were told they made in house. Super creamy,Good,Good,
"The view was pretty spectacular even though the restaurant was not turning (maintenance). The meals was pricey as you would expect from a Chart House. All in all not horrible but, the staff lacked training and maturity. A great place to take out of towners. The view compensates for the rest.",,Good,Bad
"I have mixed feelings about my recent meal at the Chart House. The setting is outstanding. Every table has a stunning view out across Texas from 750' high-and rotating slowly as well so every guest gets a 360 degree view. Very Cool! Unfortunately you will pay dearly to experience this incredible venue. The food was pretty good-standard Landry's fare-but pretty pricey (overall a bit higher than standard Landry's prices). Likely this is due to the restaurant's somewhat small capacity and the upkeep needed to keep a rotating restaurant at the top of a tall tower in operation. Not out of line with other fancy eateries, and High-Rollers will certainly not be shocked, but regular folks need to be prepared for some sticker shock if they don't regularly spend $28-$40 per plate. Service was good and we certainly enjoyed the experience-really a one of a kind restaurant.",,Good,Good
Loved the views. Had to get used to the restaurant spinning ever so slightly at first. Decent selection for food. I ordered the Prime rib which was very good. Typical steak and seafood restaurant. I've heard steaks are better elsewhere. Wasn't disappointed with the views though!,Good,Good,
"Stopped for lunch after visiting the tower. The view was good and the rotating flour was pretty cool. The food was okay, not bad. Is eat here again if I was up the tower.",Good,Good,
"We took some out of country visitors to the Chart House on the Tower for dinner.  The view, as always is impressive.  The food however, not so much.  It is far below traditional Landry's standards.  The food was barely warm and felt like it had been under a warmer for quite some time.  For $50 per person, you can do much better elsewhere although the view will not be as good.  Landry's is far beyond Frontier Enterprises (the former operator of the Tower restaurant) but below restaurants you will find in Golden Nugget's in Vegas in Lake Charles.  Save your money for dinner and just go to the observation deck or the bar for Happy Hour.",Bad,Good,
"Even though the restaurant had issues with the cleanliness of the eating utensils and glasses, the staff was friendly and attentive.  Food was good but very pricey.  Nighttime view of San Antonio was the best part of the evening.  The one thing we were not fond of was the required ""amusement park"" photo prior to getting into the restaurant elevator.",Good,Good,Good
"We had a very kind waiter but waited an hour for lunch. A salad and fish and chips. Both were awful. Very hard to mess up a salad, but the chicken on it was massively over cooked. I would not bother for a meal. The view may be worth it for a drink at the bar.",Bad,Good,
"This place goes on the list for me of never go again.  The food was pretty bad. Cold to lukewarm!  Service was non existent and the atmosphere was actually so dark I could not read the menu.  For romantic and better food, any other bar in San Antonio will do.  Chart house is part of  a TOURIST ATTRACTION.  There are many better places on the River Walk  The food at our Westin River-walk bar blew this away.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Of course you expect to pay for the view.  We looked on the website and the lunch menu was reasonable.  When we got there, it was the dinner menu which is offered at lunch on Saturday and Sunday. $$$   We ordered appetizers which were quite large so that helped.  They were okay.  It's part of the Landy Restaurant group, which doesn't impress me much. It's a good way to get up the tower if it's a crowed day as it's free to go to the restaurant -- you get a pass to the Observation Deck if you buy an entree.",Good,Good,
"Went to have lunch at the top of the Tower of Americas. Were told upon arrival that lunch time was over, despite me showing them on their website that lunch ended at 3pm, not 2pm (this has been updated on their site since then). They agreed to let us use the lunch menu, with lots of attitude from the hostess. The service was terrible, we waited over an hour for our food. The drink I requested (a monarch margarita) was not available due to them being out of the ingredients. The food was almost inedible, tasted like a previously frozen ""bubba burger"". Music was loud and was techno/dance- I didn't feel this matched the ambiance of the restaurant. Will not be returning or recommending to others.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Made several phone calls the last couple of days to get a reservation for our Anniversary dinner.   Next to impossible to get someone to answer the phone.   Messages left on the voicemail requesting the time and date we wanted went unanswered.   No return phone call.   When we finally got someone on the phone after making 5 more phone calls the day of our anniversary that went to voice mail box (again! ) they had nothing but a 10pm reservation.  When asking about confirmation from the messages we had left, all we got was ""sorry,  all we have is 10pm"".  We'll just take our business elsewhere if this is the type of treatment and service to expect.",,,Bad
"Great view and atmosphere. Our main course was very good. DO NOT ORDER THE MOLTEN LAVA CAKE! This was a huge expensive disappointment. It was cooked almost all the way through and was served more cold than warm. I told the waiter who really did not seem to care.  I told him I would eat it anyway since it takes 40 minutes to make. He told me the cake needs to cool down so it can be taken out of the pan. I have baked these before. Lava cakes are served hot. My guess is it was baked to long, then my waiter forgot it on the counter. Advise-  skip the dessert!
Because of this and the waiters poor knowledge of lava cakes I give the Chart House Restaurant only a medium rating. At the prices they charge everything should have been perfect.",,Good,Bad
Loved the view of the city while dining.  The drinks was wonderful.  The appetizers was superb.  The entr√©e was not so grand.  Given how much we paid and trust me the price was not the problem it was the taste.  The entrees was real bland with no seasoning.  I don't require a lot of seasoning but when I have to a least add salt to my food then I know it is really bland.  Total disappointed otherwise they would have received 5 stars.,,Good,
"Maybe this is not a fair review because I was there for a business dinner which was a buffet.  The view was gorgeous.  We happened to be there during a storm and the lightening was spectacular!  The food was very mediocre, as was the service.  I know that our vendor paid $50 per person and we had a very modest buffet for that price.  Disappointing, but the view really did make up for the food.",Bad,Good,
"I have been to both the Chart House restaurant and the bar that accompanies it. 


I will first review the Chart House. This place I highly recommend. It rotates so you get a complete view of the city. The food is great and the servers were really attentive and funny. I went with my fianc√© and it was the perfect romantic dinner. I highly recommend it and would give it the highest marks. 


Now, if you don't want to wait for the Chart House, because it can be a long wait, you can go to Bar 601. Bar 601 is really only conducive to just bar seating so if your party is more than two people good luck. I thankfully was there with just one of my friends recently. We were able to find a table and also able to order food off of the Chart House menu. I would not recommend going to Bar 601. The Chart House is worth the wait relative to this. Not only do you not get the panoramic view, you're never sure who your server is, and I don't believe that they would know how to properly pour wine. I say this because I'm not a snob, but I do believe that the proper way of pouring a new glass of wine is not to take another glass of wine and dump its contents into your current empty glass. I would not go back here and give it the lowest marks. That's why my review is just average.",Good,Good,Good
"I might added more stars, but today's mannager is useless, one you don't want to have in your restaurant.
Today the tower doesn't move, ok, I can understand that; but the drink's fountain doesn't work as well....
My kids are drinking iced tea they don't like, and water, my wife doesn't drink beer and wine, so she is drinking water as well.
Please tell me if they can't go to a Wallmart and buy 1Q Coke and stuff drink's???
I haven't (Im here right now, April 1st, 2:50 pm) met the manager, but I can tell you he/she don't deserve to be at that position",Bad,,Bad
"This is a really cool restaurant. It rotates at the top of the tower for a great view of San Antonio and the surrounding area. The service was good. The food is not what you would expect. I got the shrimp scampi linguine. to me the shrimp was not very good. i would have rather had Red Lobster. Especially for the price. I would probably not go back, to me the it wasn't worth the price, but the elevator ride was free for the restaurant and bar",Bad,Good,Good
"This was the first place I booked on my trip. We arrived at 7pm and whilst the service was great, half the menu was sold out on both the starters and mains leaving both my partner struggling to find something we could eat. The food we chose was fine but nothing exceptional. Seattle space needle and CN tower Toronto are much better.",,,Good
"I brought my 91 year old mother here from Florida for a mini vacation. I thought it would be special to take her for a delicious dinner and a beautiful view of San Antonio. A special occasion that I really wanted to be nice for her. 
Rochelle was our waitress and I do want to say that she was wonderful. Unfortunately the food was not. Four of us came here for dinner and 3 of the 4 dishes were sent back. The manager was very gracious and removed the meals from our bill which I thought was first class. However, I would have preferred to have a delicious meal. Especially for what you pay for the food at CH. 
I really believe for the money, there are places that are much better. The view was nice but you can pay separately to see it for much less.",Bad,Good,Good
We visited for the first time and were disappointed when we reached the Chart House Restaurant at the top. When you get off the elevator you quickly realize that the restrooms make the lobby area have a foul smell which you get a whiff of every time someone opens the door.  We got seated within 45 minutes so we didn't suffer too long. We really almost decided to leave based on that but we were hungry so we stayed. The food and service were good but they have got to do something about those restrooms. Because of this I rated at average.,Good,Bad,Good
We waited an hour and half for our meal. Steaks were overcooked and tasteless. Waiter was forgetful.,Bad,,Bad
"My husband and I went to this restaurant for dinner the last night of our vacation. We both ordered prime rib, a glass of Malbec, and shared a spinach side dish. Positive  comments: the food was quite good - well prepared and nicely presented.  Our waiter was efficient and attentive, and best of all, the view is spectacular. Negative comments: the restaurant was absolutely freezing - to the point that we both put our coats on and my husband eventually put his hat on too - definitely something we have never done before anywhere!  Quite pricey at somewhere around $200 USD, considering we did not order appetizers or dessert; however, I did not mind too much given the view. 
 The bottom line: it is an adequate restaurant with a spectacular view!  I will likely not go back though as one can see the view from the observation deck and there are much better restaurants in San Antonio.",Good,,Good
"Have been to this location once before so we decided to go for New Year's eve. Good thing I wanted the dinner menu since that's all that they were serving at 1 pm with one flaw. You can't order prime rib, WOW! So I ordered a New York strip medium rare which came out medium at best. And when it comes to service, the service dog seated across from us worked harder! Thanks atleast the elevator worked!",Bad,,Bad
"When the best thing was the elevator ride.....not a great place for an expensive dinner.


My sons steak came out cold.....nice that the manager took it off and bought our dessert, but I would rather just have it the right way from the beginning.  My wife was served second or third most of the night.  Big deal to me to have her respected and treated well.  Service was ok, but slow at times.  Just not what you would expect for the price.",,,
"I must agree with the other reviewer about the horrible service provided by the Chart House Mgmt. To pay the ""mandatory gratuity"" you must provide at least the service ""expected"". You can't come to the table and bring me no bread or offer me an espresso when clearly it was not an offer but an additional charge. Speaking of espresso, how can you bring coffee of that nature to a party of 4 with no spoons to stir in the sugar which was brought 10 mins later by another waiter ? Uhm last time I checked it was supposed to be served hot on the spot and to drink it hot most of all. Speaking of the decor and view hands down, that was wonderful but to get back down the elevator I had too literally call the server to come to the elevators because it was like a rampage of elephants squeezing through everything where it only says that 14 pelle can go at a time! That was the cherry in the cake, no security, no some type of organization between shuttle runs or not , in fact we walked back to the Alamo dome, got there before the shuttle did. Probably they were arguing on who needed to board on first. Overall, this restaurant for big events and whatsoever is not ready, cannot be trusted (mandatory gratuity was not included or stated in the confirmation email), and the service was equal to zero, maybe less than zero too; for the price that you pay you should expect a stellar service or at least try. Definitely would not recommend this place for an event. For other dining experiences maybe but for parties like NYE it was a ripoff.",,Good,Bad
"Before I began I must say that I've reviewed many restaurants and am always honest about my experiences. It pains me to write this one and has taken me an entire day to make myself do so... My better half and I made dinner reservations and decided to try Chart House ourselves due to the mixed reviews we'd read. Upon arriving, our photo was taken by a very sweet young lady. We then waited in line for the elevator, which was super long due to the fact that there was only one in use at the time. Once we arrived and checked in with the hostess, we waited to be seated which was to be expected. However, what was not to be expected was what happened once we were seated... We literally sat at the table for 18 minutes without even being ""greeted"" by our server. Being that customer service is at the top of our priority list when visiting any place of business, we felt a bit unwelcome and decided to leave at minute 19. We stood for almost 5 minutes waiting for the elevator to return and just before getting on the elevator, we were approached by the individual who we learned was suppose to be our server. Her words were, ""Are y'all leaving? Did you change your mind?""... Of course, we responded ""yes""... I'm sorry, but if our reservations were at 6:45, which we were on time for on a Wednesday night and by 7:50 we haven't even received a greeting from our server, I felt that leaving was a justifiable thing to do. Furthermore, if she walked up minutes after we'd be standing at the elevator asking of our intentions, it's obvious that she saw us seated at some point during our 18 minutes of being seated and could've at least greeted us and said she'd return soon. This was a restaurant we'd longed to experience and we sadly will not be returning. I'm rating it a 2 because the view was really nice and also because the photographer was really nice and allowed us to purchase our photos before leaving the tower. In addition, the hostesses were all pleasant. I hate to rate low based on one server, but when in business, all employees should be expected to be a representative of the company at all times. We were highly disappointed and hope that future customers have a better experience than we did.",,Good,Bad
As always... Great view and the food ok. The staff is very nice and our table was great. Cocktails were better at the bar... I am sure they drinks that came to our table were prepared in the same bar... Maybe not.,Bad,Good,Good
"A group of 6 of us got together for a Christmas Dinner at the tower.  The view was wonderful, especially with the Christmas lights.  Our table was long and facing the window, so that all 6 of us were sitting on the same side.  I assume this was done so that everyone could see the view, and also for space considerations so that we were not blocking the walkway; however, it made it difficult to converse with the group.  Wine and beer options were available.  The spinach salad was outstanding---the best I'd ever had.  Likewise for the Caesar salad.  The clam chowder was also very good.  After an hour, we got our entrees, which were not hot---a bit more than room temp.  My prime rib was supposed to be medium, but was more thoroughly cooked than I wanted.  It was not tender.  My husband had a New York Strip steak that he had ordered medium rare, but when he received it, it was medium well done.  The waiter agreed it was too well done, and agreed to replace it.  After a while, the manager came around and offered my husband something else for him to eat while a new steak was being prepared.  He chose the clam chowder, and shortly thereafter, the new steak arrived.  The waiter asked him to check the steak, but this time it was very rare.  Once again, the waiter took the steak away.  By the time my husband got the third steak, everyone was finished eating.  The manager apologized for the mistakes, and said he would ""take care of"" the steak since there was such a delay.  Fine.  When the bill came, I used my phone to be able to see the charges (very dark inside) and saw that we had not been charged for my spinach salad, but were charged for  2 clam chowders (only my husband had 1 complimentary--not 2), and were also charged for 2 New York strip steaks.  In talking with the waiter, he agreed this was a mistake, so he took it back to re-work it.  On the 2nd attempt, everything was correct, except that we were still being charged for the New York Strip steak.  Once again, we told him, the manger had agreed to ""take care of it,"" which we assumed meant to comp it, so he said he had to speak to the manager about it.  After a while, he came back with the corrected bill.  With all the delays, our dinner turned into almost a 3 hour experience, which was not necessarily inconvenient, but was a bit frustrating.  Our waiter was really trying to take care of things, but was very busy.  All in all, the food was OK, but not great.  The salads were the highlight of the meal.",,Good,Bad
"My husband and I along with another couple had dinner on a Tuesday evening.  We had Tobin Theatre tickets at 7:30 and made a reservation at 5:30.  We were seated at 5:30.  It was not a busy night but did not see the waiter for 10 minutes. When he finally appeared, we told him that we would need to watch our time to get to the theatre.  He took our drink order and disappeared for 15 minutes. By this time it was 6:00 pm and we ordered our food, again mentioning that we needed to be out by 7:00.  The manager also came by and we discussed our situation with him.  Our food finally arrived at 6:30 and the waiter had forgotten one of the side orders.  The manager offered to comp a dessert.  Well, we finally found the waiter to get our check at 7:00 pm and the dessert had still not arrived.  Needless to say that even tough the food was good, we will never be returning to this restaurant.  It made for a very stressful evening. Other than the beautiful view, it doesn't come up to par with other Charter House restaurants in other cities.",,Good,Bad
Had a reservation on Saturday Night (11-28-2015).  Started off having issues getting there because of the construction around the tower.  When we got in we checked in with the host in the lobby just fine.  he told us to go around to the elevator in front of the gift shop and tell the attendant we were going to the Chart House.  We walked over there and could not find an attendant because there were so many folks standing around.  The gift shop people told use the wait for an elevator was over an hour.  We went back to the host and he said that was just the way it was.  If we wanted to eat we would have to stand in line over an hour.  He really didn't care and offered no explanation.  he was too busy talking to some young girl to give us any of his time.  As such we left to find someplace else.  We well not be going back.,,,Bad
"We should have known, since this is a tourist spot, that it wouldn't be as good as the Chart House in the Golden Nugget in Vegas.  The Happy Hour at the bar was very good and Cathy was an excellent server.  There were locals enjoying the Happy Hour but they didn't stay for dinner - that should have served as a warning.  The meal itself was okay with decent fish and sides, however, our waiter was very confusing.  My wife's meal came with two sides, but it seemed that most of the listed sides were excluded.  We finally gave up and just ordered the sides we wanted - sauted mushrooms and asparagus, and were charged the full menu price for both.  The service overall was very slow, as others have mentioned.  If you want to see the views from the Tower of the Americas, just go to the observation deck or enjoy Happy Hour at the bar, but I would skip the restaurant.",,Good,Bad
"We visited the Tower of Americas and enjoyed a great view of San Antonio from the height of 750 feet.   We had lunch at the Chart House Restaurant located in the Observation Tower.   The food was average,  but the views were great.   I plan to slip the lunch on my next visit!",,Good,

This restaurant sits at the top of a tower and it rotates around so that you get a view of the city. And it is supposed to be a higher end restaurant so not a place to show up in shorts and sandals.


For those who get motion sickness, beware of the rotation. Some people in our group did feel ill from the motion (I also do get motion sickness but felt fine in this restaurant).


For me, this dinner came down to the food. It really was not anything that great. Or at least if I'm told this is a high end restaurant, I expect some better food. If this is a regular restaurant, I maybe would have thought this is ok, but it was mediocre at best for a fancy pants place. The salad was just iceberg lettuce and a bit of other scattered vegetables. Dessert was creme brulee which really was not that good at all. My entree was fish which was actually good, but it does seem wrong to be eating fish in Texas. Everyone agreed the food was just ok but nothing to write home about.


I know the servers were busy, but they were slow on filling up on the wine and never did bring any bread after asking twice (the butter had been sitting on the table all night waiting for it to come, but it never did).


I also hate to point this out, but San Antonio doesn't have any sort of view, so having dinner up a rotating tower isn't an experience. You see a bunch of street lights, some random building lights and flat darkness around you.


I have no idea for the value of this place since I wasn't footing the bill here. However, despite this, I don't think it is worth visiting again based on the food. It is not a bad place to go, nor is it special. If you're in my situation of going with a group and it's not you who is paying, then I'd say why not, but if it's your money, then there must be better places out there in the city.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had 630pm reservations on a Sunday evening, but when we arrived, we waited nearly ten minutes to be seated.  There were numerous empty tables, so not sure why the delay. Our table was the level closest to the center core.  When anyone walked by, the floor shook along with our table.  This restaurant rotates 360 degrees in one hour, so we were able to view a spectacular sunset while dining.
We certainly didn't experience fine dining service, which is the reason for the AVERAGE rating of this review.  Robert was our server and he was right-on at greeting us and taking our drink and food orders, but once our salads were served, he became nearly non-existent and inattentive, so overall, very disappointed with the service we received!.  We waited over 20 minutes from finishing our salads until our entrees were served without an explanation for the delay. Then we sat with empty plates. We had to request a refill of water.  Then waited another 15 minutes for our dessert (mud pie) to be served.  Perhaps they were scraping the mud from the San Antonio river that it took so long!  Then the looooooooooooong wait for our check to arrive.
We began with Beefsteak Tomato Salad that was huge and definitely enough for 3 people to share.  Excellent tasting tomatoes!  I would return just for this salad!
Mahi Mahi Mediterranean was the Chef special ($43.50) which was excellent.  Served with angel hair pasta.
Hubby's declared his Prime Rib ($29.50) as good, but not excellent.  He also ordered a side of Lobster Mac and Cheese ($14) which it was watery, barely cheesy, with only a few crumbs of lobster.  We hardly ate any of it  and shame on us for not returning it to the Chef.",,Good,Bad
"I have eaten at many Chart House Restaurants and was surprised at the quality of food at this one.  The view of San Antonio was spectacular.  Service was fine.  The calamari and prime rib were fine as well as the chicken fricasse.  But the scallops were inedible (salty, overlooked and not fresh).  The mahi was burned on the bottom and also overcooked.  For a ""seafood"" restaurant, the seafood was definitely the downside.  You would think the server would ask when picking up a plate with 3/4 of the food uneaten!  I'd recommend going to the lounge to enjoy the view and then head down to the Riverwalk for dinner!",Bad,Good,Good
"We made a reservation and were greeted at the base of the Tower of America. Thought we would get there early(6:15) since our reservation was at 7:15 and we wanted to grab a drink at the bar first. Keep in mind, you DONOT get priority to ride the elevator if you have a reservation. We waited 50 minutes in a long line with others that were just going to ride to the observation deck. We were greeted and seated at an excellent window-side table. Mona, our waitress was excellent. We thought we were headed for a good evening. My wife ordered the filet and I ordered the Tour of Shrimp. She received her filet and I was delivered Salmon on a cedar plank (not what I ordered). I decided to just have that since her food was there already. The rice was great, beans great and salmon was undercooked. They offered to fix but my wife was essentially done with her ""average"" filet. The Manager was excellent and tried to make amends by not charging me for my meal and gave us a complimentary drink. All is fine, right? No, the drink that I received was filled with crushed ice and part of what looked like string from a mop. Yuck! We spoke with the Manager again who did the right thing. He apologized and didn't charge us for anything. We left our waitress a tip as she was excellent and left for good. We won't return nor would we recommend you consider this for your evening. Based upon my experience I think it might be frightening to see the back of the kitchen.",Bad,Good,Good
"Located on top of the Tower of America, the Chart House offers innovative American cuisine along with a picturesque 360 degree view of San Antonio. My family enjoyed the beef and shrimp. Overall, the ambience is relaxing.",Good,Good,
The prime rib was good but pricey. The filet wasn't that impressive.  It took a lengthy amount of time to initially get our drinks and bread. Once the meal arrived and we began eating I had to ask another waiter to refill my drink. Our waiter apologized and give us a complimentary dessert but for those prices and that location the service should have been as awesome as the view.,Good,Good,Bad
"We enjoyed our lunch very much and a city view to die for. Yes, it was pricier but the quality and portion were GREAT!  The ambience was spectacular. 


The only reason we minus two stars was our waiter forgot left and right to bring our soup, suggested dessert that we already ordered, filled our water glasses. It was unacceptable to provide this kind of service in this high end restaurant. 


This is the reason why I hate the tipping system so much in this country. Tipping is supposed to be customers' appreciation for the quality of service they receive. But, instead, these days we are forced to tip just to compensate for the lowe wage waiters/waitresses are earning. No wonder there is no incentive for them to provide a Good.",Good,Good,Bad
"My husband and I picked Chart House as our date night dinner outing while in town visiting family. We were a little disappointed.  We arrived a bit before our reservations so we waited in the bar area (I believe it's called the 605).  We sat down in the chairs in the lounge area and laughed because we felt like we were a foot off the ground. The service was great at the bar. Once we were seated at our table, our server failed to appear what seemed like forever. At one point we thought about walking out. He finally arrived and we ordered our drinks, soups and entrees. The drinks and soups came out quickly but our entree took a while. The food was not bad. We weren't disappointed in the food. Only the service. My husband mentioned that the men's room was a mess and dirty. Overall,for the amount of money we spent, we would not recommend the Chart House.  We will probably go back to The Little Rhein which is well worth the money.",,Bad,Bad
"Decided to go here for lunch before we headed back to Houston. When you first walk in the building there's someone taking your name, she gave us a card for a free appetizer or dessert. The elevator was fun because you see the views going up. The hostess was a little standoff-ish/ snobby. My son asked me why did everyone look mad like they didn't like their job. We got seated and I have to say the views were breathtaking. It took probably 40 min to go all the way around. I ordered the cedar plank salmon, my husband got a steak and my son got fish and chips and for appetizer we got coconut shrimp. The coconut shrimp was cold and wasn't anything special. I've had better salmon at Cheddar's for half the price. I checked the receipt after we left and noticed they charged me the dinner price. The food wasn't extraordinary or anything special, the price is sky high, I would skip this restaurant.",Bad,Good,Bad
"The best thing about this meal was the server, Spencer.  He worked hard, checked on us frequently, was friendly and professional.  First of all they were out of several things on the menu and we were there at 6:15.   The lobster bisque was good, not great.  The strawberry salad excellent, mahi good, and shrimp scampi good but a little dry.  This was the most expensive meal we had in San Antonio and we were disappointed.  So go for the view but not the food.",Bad,Good,Good
"I book through OpenTable when in a new city.  Looked forward to this place due to the view.  Hostess was too busy with flirting to punch my name in the computer.  Had to get that no show taken away later.  Food average fare, nothing special.  Neither was the view.  Ver pricy to see office buildings and parking lots.",,,Bad
"Was disappointed at the menu selection for the weekend. Wish the Mon-Fri lunch menu was offered on Sat/Sun. Service was very good. Came up for the rotating floor, not told that it wasn't working till they sat us. 
Overall it was OK.",Bad,,Good
"If you want to see San Antonio from 75 stories high this is the place to go.  If you want Good this is not the place to go.  I don't think the rugs have been vacuumed for a month as there were items growing under our table, very dirty.  In desperate need of rug update.  The food was below par especially for a Chart House chain that I'm familiar with.  Bread should not be microwaved before you get it either.  If you order a steak medium rare you should get it even close not well done.
The best part of this experience was our server that evening.",Bad,Bad,Good
"Gorgeous view and the experience started well with seat and greet.  We were on the early side of the dinner crowd, so the place wasn't slammed yet.  That is why it was surprising when the wine took forever to come, as did the appetizers (which were very tasty).  At that point, the manager came to our table and apologetically asked if she could move us to accommodate a large party.  She was very nice and even offered to pick up our tab for the inconvenience.  We agreed easily, and were relocated.  That is when all service stopped, even though we stopped several servers and asked about our food.  We were told our original server would bring the food, but it never happened.  I finally went to the actual kitchen to try to locate it.  Finally, someone came to our table to say that our selections were sold out - no apologies for leaving us sitting for an hour.  Needless to say, we left without re-ordering.",Good,Good,Bad
"Good things first: The meal was really good. My wife ordered Range Chicken, I ordered Chicken Francese. Both menues were really good. Also the desert was good. The bad thing: The service. We waited 20 minutes to order, another 30 for the food. The plate for the bread was unused, nobody asked whether we wanted some bread. We got the check and we had to ask to get some desert and an espresso. The espresso machine was broken. We got the desert for free. Another 20 minutes waiting for the desert. Another 20 minutes for the final check. In the end the whole dinner took 2 hours, from 7 pm to 9 pm. The restaurant was not even fully booked. I don't know what they do when all tables are in use...
So 5 stars for the food, 2 for the service and waiting, average 3.",Good,,Bad
"This restaurant seemed a cool place to enjoy my graduation party with my family. I went with a group of adults and my 2 children both under 2. I was told over the phone that this place is child friendly, it absolutely is not!! They have no changing tables anywhere, nor do they have slings for car seats. Aside from these issues the food is overpriced, mediocre in quality and there is not much to choose from. Service is equally terrible. The space is cramped and there is constantly someone invading you're space. The wait for the elevators is ridiculous. We actually were put in a service elevator to descend, which looked slightly cleaner than a truck stop restroom. Now for the positives: the views are amazing!! That's it. Save you're money and eat on the river walk.",Bad,,Bad
"Typical Chart House food - which is to say that it was pretty good.  I've been in a few of these rotating dining room restaurants and this was probably one of the less exciting views during dinner, but it still beats looking at the same four walls or whatever static scenery would be outside the window otherwise.  


Good meal, nice atmosphere, but going here once was probably enough for me.",Good,Good,
"Very upsetting dining experience.  We choose Chart House for our anniversary/Christmas Eve dinner based on our familiarity with CH in other states, their reliable quality of food and the nice view of San Antonio with the sparkling Christmas lights below.  Well that's where the joy of our celebration stopped.  Our waiter was a nightmare, extremely unfriendly to the point of being rude.  He began by announcing he was tired due to the holiday workload.  He refused to accept the free appetizer cards our hotel concierge gave us to use that evening until the manager came to the rescue.  When he plopped the bread down we immediately saw it was bread slices not the always delicious assortment of breads CH provides.  The two main fish courses I tried ordering were sold out so I ordered a steak that was supposed to come with mashed potatoes.  When it arrived there was rice in place of mashed potatoes.  When questioned the waiter shot back that the mashed were sold out due to the large crowd for Christmas Eve dinner this being the busiest day of the year for them.  He never offered a choice of something else besides the rice.  The quality of the food was not up to Chart House standards at all.  As we stood up to leave I heard our waiter offer the table of two behind us a choice of anything on the menu since the mashed potatoes were sold out.  There is no excuse to run out of entrees 3 hours into opening the restaurant when you know it's your busiest day of the year.  Shame on Chart House San Antonio!!  Go to the lounge for a drink and great view and move on to a restaurant where you can enjoy your evening out.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Food is nothing great considering the bill, the appetizer taste like fish grease, the mash potatoes taste like a bandaid and my asparagus taste like the oil from a BBQ grill. I loved our waiter he was very nice. The view is gorgeous. We paid $125 for the 2 of us and I can say that a fast food restaurant has better tasting food. Thumbs down! Next time I'll just go to the lounge. Wish I chosen a better restaurant for my boyfriends birthday.",Bad,Good,Good
"We had lunch at this revolving restaurant high atop the Tower of the Americas.  It was not busy and was very quiet which is good for conversation.  We enjoyed the changing scenery as the restaurant made a full circle of the area.  We didn't pay the fee to go to the observation deck because we felt the view right under it was fine from the restaurant.


Service was on the slow side but that wasn't a problem as we wanted to enjoy the view.  However, service was not at all friendly.  We asked for more bread for the table and I almost felt guilty asking.  Either our server was having a bad day or she doesn't enjoy her work.  The menu is pricey which would not be a problem if the food lived up to it.  We were quite disappointed with it.  


I will say, however, that I was contacted by management after I left a poor review on their website.  This might be a good sign that they are trying to change things.


I recommend it for the view but little else.",Bad,Good,
"the food was good, our waiter was Spencer was nice, but i was expecting a little better service, we had to wait for waters and for our botle of wine 15 min another waiter Ernesto brought the waters after he probobly noticed that we've been there for a while, he made sure we had everything we need, he brought a hot towel after i finished my quail and was checking on us all the time, can't say the same thing about Spencer, none of managers stoped by to check on us, seemed like nobody care, may be Tilman shoud visit them :) and see what is going on there, because people pay money and expect some service there, thank you Ernesto",Good,,
"I made a reservation the day prior for a 7:30 dinner. The elevator ride up was neat and had a window to view the ride up. We had a short wait until we were seated, which was right by the window & as requested. I didn't notice a foul carpet smell & neither did my pregnant wife. The food was pricey, but pretty good. My wife had the almost $40 filet and only ate half so she could have it the next day. When the waiter asked to take our plates, we assumed he would box the remaining food, but he threw it away instead & after surprised that we had wanted to take the food home. We kindly finished our drinks & left pretty disappointed. The views are great, but there's more to fine dining than the location of the restaurant. We would not return or recommend this place. Just pay the $20+ to ride the elevator up for the view & skip the meal.",Good,Good,Bad
"If I can leave zero stars I would! First of all the place smells like bad dry cleaning, wet carpet, moldy building, or let's just say dirty!
We are in San Antonio for a romantic weekend a friend of ours got married. We are pregnant and recently married so we are making it  a baby Moon. So we thought it would be a romantic night out on the town. We are staying in the king Williams area nice romantic walk over! But let me tell you oh my Lord when we walked in our noses both quenched!
If this is a corporate Place someone needs to go there and redo the carpet and the walls because it smells like my grandma's old couch, which actually smelled much better
We were told that it was a one hour wait when they were empty tables downstairs. We didn't calls a boss we went to the bar, which was empty. The waitress came over after about 10 minutes and offered us menus, we ordered our drinks and food at the same time however they were out of what we ordered
We were able to get a shrimp cocktail and a whiskey with the dirty glass
I was looking for the girls who left her lip impressions on the glass but she had left. So the waitress brought me over a clean glass! We ate the shrimp cocktail which was pretty delicious horseradish! We paid the bill and got the hell out of that place! I would not recommend that place to anyone looking for a meal. Perhaps a view something to see but be prepared for the smell. Again if trip advisor had a zero rating that's what I would give it",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Short walk from Riverwalk. Revolving restaurant at top of Tower of the Americas. Some of the dishes are very well done. Staff is marginally friendly; waiter really wasn't. Crab stack appetizer and coconut shrimp yummy. You are there for the view. Revolves slowly around. Reserve a time before 7pm and window views possible. Not sure it is worth the higher prices if not at window seats. Using your receipt that shows a min. of 1 entree,  you can access observation deck for free, after meal. Recommend 6pm seating (in March) to get full daylight, sunset, and night views of city over dinner. Be wary of waiter trying to rush you out even though there are empty tables throughout. Stand your ground and enjoy the experience.",Good,Good,
Went for lunch service was terable 1 hour to get my 6 year olds meal food was disgusting and not worth the wait,Bad,,Bad
"This is our 5th time to the tower and we debated whether or not to eat.  It costs like $12 to go to the observation deck and look out.  This means we had $50 house money to start with.  Chart House is pretty fancy and I sometimes feel looked down on because we aren't fancy people.  Service wasn't bad, but pretty slow considering it wasn't that crowded.  View was wonderful as always.  Food was nothing to write home about, something to piece through while trying to find all the hotels and tourist places we have visited over the years.",,Good,
"My husband and I were in San Antonio business/pleasure March 2015.  We wanted to have a nice dinner in revolving restaurant at top of Tower of Americas and enjoy the lights and view at night.  We made reservations.  We came early to see the attraction prior to dinner.  The movie was not working so we had to wait until after dinner to view it.  So we went to the bar to have a drink and appetizer while waiting until time for dinner.  The place is very poorly marked.  If we hadn't ask there is no way we would know how to get to the restaurant.  Certain elevators only stop there.  The personnel were all very nice but not very helpful with directions but we finally found the Restaurant and were seated right away.  However they wanted to seat just the 2 of us at a huge table.  When told that wouldn't work they nicely found us a more appropriate table.  By now the fog has rolled in and unable to see anything (of course this not the restaurants fault)..  We ordered drinks, soup and salad.  Hoping for a slow relaxing dinner.  Maybe 10 minutes after our soup and salad arrived our entrees arrived.  We both hate when this happens.  To top it off my husband's dinner was not hot.  He sent it back and they made him a new meal.  Meanwhile I had to eat mine so it would not get cold. My filet was delicious but all in all not a pleasant experience.  When you spend this kind of money you  do not want to be rushed.  We were not served any bread or rolls with our meal either.",Bad,Bad,Bad
We have never been to a Chart House and expected a glorious meal based on the buzz.  Lunch was fine...just fine....fish tacos were served instead of fish and chips.  And my salad was lame.  The hummus was the best part of the meal.   We did watch the world go by while eating.,,Good,
"This Chart House was once much better. 


The view is still amazing but the food and service have fallen.  The waiter did not put the wine in a chiller, the food was tasteless and was returned, the service was inattentive.  


The mango crab stack is still good but that about all. 


Go here for a sunset view appetizer then head to Bohanan's for amazing food and service.",Bad,Good,Bad
We've been to several Chart House restaurants around the country and have always had an outstanding experience...until now. The San Antonio Chart House was a disappointment in every aspect.,,Bad,
"This was suppose to be a special lunch for mother and teenage son which is a rarity to start with. We had been to the Seattle Space Needle previous summer so our expectation were high.
The check in and table on the window were perfect! We were given both the lunch and dinner menu to enjoy. My son ordered from the lunch menu the short ribs but our waiter said they take six hours to prepare and would not be available. We were having lunch at 12:00 ordering off the lunch menu. Then he ordered two steaks and they were also not available. He decided to order a plain cheeseburger with nothing on it and I ordered Grilled Chicken Ceasar salad. The salad came out by itself with no chicken so they prepared a new one. My son's hamburger came out with onions and sauce which was sent back and reordered. My grilled chicken came out cold, dry, and a couple of hard pieces. My son's second hamburger came out well-done and charred on one side. We never had the opportunity to eat at the same time. We requested bread basket while waiting and this was delicious. Of course there was only one butter plate set up on the tableWe cancelled the Lava cake since we were already there for one and a half hours. This was suppose to be a time to show my son what Good looks like. He loves Mortons and Ruth Chris so if you want Good go there after you go to the observation tower.",Bad,Good,Bad
"We ended up picking The Chart House for a special 50th Wedding Anniversary Dinner celebration for a table of 5.
I called ahead to make the reservation to let them know what we were celebrating and asked what the dress code was. Needless to say they don't enforce their own dress code, people were dressed in everything but Business casual. From jeans to pants borrowed from the 80s to baseball caps.
No one recognized the couple until well into service. The young man serving us was very nice but looked like he rolled out of bed into dirt in his uniform. Wasn't schooled in fine dining service and not even the simplest things like replacing silverware, etc...
The temperature was freezing with the air blowing straight down on the tables. I had to ask them to turn down the air, but there was no avoiding the fan the way it is setup.
Overall the food was good. The Crab lobster fondue came out Luke warm. Tuna appetizer was good. Salads were good, filet was good, swordfish was good. Red snapper was made like a schnitzel, thin, dried out, not worth the money. So table of five, $425 later... In my opinion, it was not worth the money spent, but the view was nice and the Inlaws enjoyed it.
Special notes, you must have $10 in cash to pay for parking and the dining room spins slowly but can be upsetting to anyone with any motion sensitivity.",Good,,Bad
"This revolving restaurant at the top of the Tower of the Americas has a great view and it is fun to watch the changing scenery while dining. We were seated at a table right next to the window which added to the enjoyment.  I must say that the view was the best part of the experience.  The food was not particularly special, except for the decadent Hot Chocolate Lava Cake, accurately described as a ""rich chocolate cake with molten center, made with Godiva liqueur"".  It was truly delicious. Prior to this, my main dish was the Chopped Salad - mixed greens, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, radishes, hearts of palm, pepperoncinis & croutons, custom-topped with grilled shrimp.  This was pretty ordinary and the 6 small shrimp (for an upcharge of $9.99) were rather underseasoned, limp and and not chargrilled.  The service was inattentive throughout, my salad was not served as ordered with dressing on the side, and we waited an inordinately long time for the bill to arrive.",Good,Good,Bad
"We went with friends who have been going to the The Tower for years on New Year's Eve.  Since the weather was cold we drove as we were told we could park at a specified parking lot at the alamo Dome and a shuttle would pick us up and drop us off at The Tower.  Guess what there was only one shuttle working!!!!We waited through three times for him to drop off and come back..it was brutally cold.  When we get to The Tower there was another wait for our reservation was at the 9:30 seating....When we finally got upstairs ,seated and placed our oders the food was cold and the steaks (which the waiter told us would be medium were well done and cold) even the mashed potatoes were cold!  I ordered a bottle of wine and the waiter brought me a glass ...I was glad the bottle did not come....
for $155.00 per person I thought we got ""took""  the bill for one couple ended up being about $415.00 if you only ad a golass of wine...when my friend looked at the bill they had not given her credit for the $300.00 she had paid just to get reservations...then when I paid my part of the bill they did the math and that was wrong also...alll in all they would have charged us $400.00 too much if we had not looked carefully at the bill..they did apologize after each mistake...
The when we were waiting for the elevator to take us down (we knew the fire marshall rule about not leaving till 12:45 ro so) but they let us stand in line till about 1 AM and then told us because of the wind the elevator was not stopping on our floor and we wuold have to go upa floor to ccatch it...This is not all...we stood in line cold,cold wind to catch the ""ONE"" shuttle back to our car...and ended up standing in the cargo part of the shutttle in the back ...that was after about 40 minutes of waiting in  the cold....So I think we will be looking for a different place next year..

"With family visiting from overseas we were so looking forward to eating at The Chart House Restaurant at the top of The Tower of Americas. It was such a disappointing evening! 


1. The restaurant was freezing cold! When we asked about it we got a vague response and apology from our waiter which didn't make sense.... And nothing changed! All 7 of us ate dinner with outdoor jackets and scarves on!!!! Ridiculous!!! 


2. They tried to squeeze 7 of us to a very small table.  No room to move!!! We asked them to add an extra table which they did. Maybe the smaller table would have helped us all stay warmer being huddled together! 


3. Bussers dropped plates 3 times while we were there. One time right at our table. 


4. I like my steaks well done. I specifically told the waiter 'no pink, like - absolutely NO pink'. Steak arrived - very pink. I sent it back and when I got it back it was still pink. Husband ate steak! 


This was not an inexpensive restaurant but the food and service did not match up to the price. 


One thing we did enjoy was the view of the city from the restaurant.",Bad,Good,Bad
"Wonderful views across the city and countryside and revolving restaurants are such fun. But the food is no better than average and it's not cheap. I've read that the grills are good but we decided to go with the main menu and that was disappointing. The service was fair but not good and I would expect better from a place like this in a location like this.
With this venue, the offering should be much much better - but you have to go there once to enjoy the revolving restaurant",Bad,Good,
"We were seated at 5:45pm on a Friday but did not get our entrees until 7pm.  The hot appetizer (fritters) we ordered arrived cold.  One of us ordered Surf and Turf with scallops but got salmon instead.  One side dish, creamed spinach, had to be sent back because it was cold and way too salty.  Dessert took another long while even though we placed the order (a souffle) before dinner.  We did not leave the restaurant until after 8pm and missed the annual River Parade show at the Riverwalk.  The restaurant had lots of empty tables but not enough staff to serve.  The hostess was not very friendly - we did not see her smile once the entire time we were there, and she would only speak when asked.  No greetings coming or going.  View of the city was great on the other hand.",Bad,Good,Bad

"The rotating restaurant on top of The Tower of the Americas has magnificent views. The food, we had filet mignon, is quite good. A pity that the service is so poor. If I get charged $ 200 for the two of us, I expect to be served by an educated water who knows how to open a champagne bottle, who does not fill the glasses to the rim and who does not constantly push more drinks and desserts.
We felt really quite uncomfortable with this guy and do not intent to return.",Good,Good,Bad
Very touristy- food was decent but server was rushing us to flip table. She forgot my salad and got my entry wrong. She owned up to it when check came. Ordered bottle of Jordan Cabernet and was priced accordingly for a restaurant. However she filled glass to top! Talk about hurry up. Even hostess was disinterested upon arrival. Even you want the great view of a spinning tourists restaurant than this is for you. If you want a nice relaxing dinner. Skip this place,Good,Good,Bad
"I traveled alone and decided to sit at the bar to watch part of a college football game and have a drink and appetizer.  The televisions should be bigger.  They look to be about 27 inches at best which isn't very ideal for watching sports.  


The bartender recommended the sangria.  I ordered it, but wouldn't do so again.  It was way too sweet for my taste, but I did like the fresh muddled blackberries.  I ordered the lobster and crab spring rolls from the cold appetizer menu.  It took quite a while before I got my order.  When the bartender brought the food, she apologized for it taking so long and explained the printer malfunctioned and the kitchen staff hadn't received my order when she placed it.  I could definitely tell.  The rolls were sloppy like they had been prepared in a hurry and fell apart as I was trying to eat them.  They tasted delicious, but I didn't expect to have to eat a spring roll with a fork.


Aside from that, the staff was friendly and the 360 view is nice.",,Good,
"This was the first restaurant we hit on our trip to San Antonio. The view was nice (who wouldn't try a rotating restaurant above the city?), but the food was nothing to get excited about... Overpriced with lacking flavor. The chicken blt was extremely dry, the burger had so much sauce that the bun was soaked through. Drinks were forgotten as well. And it was not busy at all, maybe 5 or 6 other tables to attend to.",Bad,Good,
"We went here while in SA for our aniversary.  We told them it was our anniversary when we made the reservations.  I was to another Chart House in another city for our anniversary and all we got was a menu wishing us ""Happy Anniversary"".  I guess maybe in 5 years since we went to the other one, they changed and would give us champaign or a free appetizer or something, but NOTHING!!!  We got another menu!  Really???  We both had prime rib which was good, but my husband doesn't eat potatoes so he ordered veggies with his and he literally got 4 (yes) little vegtables!  Could  they spare the veggies??  Waiter was very young and seemed new.  We had to ask him several times if they took Triple A discount and he kept forgetting to check.  They do take it (10%).  After going to 2 Chart Houses, I will not go back.  They are cheap when it comes to special occasions.  View is awsome!!",Good,Good,Bad
"Quite an amazing location, we had reservations and showed up on time. After a few minutes we were seated and got menus. We ordered wine and our dinner. For starters we had calamari and an avocado and crab stack. The calamari showed up cold and from the first bite must have come from a bulk bag of frozen squid. This was promptly sent back and removed from the bill. The stack was well presented but completely bland, devoid of any flavor or seasoning. For mains I ordered a piece of ""fresh"" Alaskan halibut grilled pink and my wife ordered the crab cakes. The crab cakes were pretty sad and seemed to contain all the ingredients from the stack! The halibut was also frozen and overcooked to a point of rubber, this was also taken of the bill.
All in all paid over $160 and didn't get to eat dinner. Maybe the steaks are the thing to get here, but definitely not the seafood.",Bad,,
Wanted to go to a decent upscale restaurant well vacatioing. So me and a friend were recommend this restaurant. I ordered a burger and fries. She ordered a steak well done. So after the first 2 times of sending it back until it was cooked like she wanted it. The 3rd time it came back looking and tasting like a dry log. It was way over cooked. And if this review site had a way to attached a picture i would attach it. Our waiter was the greatest. But whoever cooked the steak need to be fired.,Bad,,Good
"As everyone knows, the view from the revolving restaurant is super.  It turned out the appetizer was really great, too.  But the bartender didn't get drinks right, so best to just order wine with your appetizer.  The busier it got, the worse the service got.  I cannot really pardon any restaurant that serves two spears of asparagus for $18.50!  Really?!!  Then, I expected a nearly $30 chicken to be half a nice rock cornish game hen, like even I can make at home.  Nope, think the palm of a woman's hand for size and relatively dry for the price.  The mashed potatoes were the best part of the whole meal.  My partner's steak was good but not great for that price and the mushrooms?  At least it was a full side serving, but just boring.  Good thing we ordered our dessert when we ordered our dinner or we would have been there for FIVE hours.  Apparently the bartender didn't know what courvoisier was, either.  Sent bourbon with a used cherry stem in it about 30 minutes after I ordered it.  Wish we had just stayed for the appetizer and wine!",,Good,Bad
I am for San Antonio and know how hot it can get but it was terribly hot and therefore uncomfortable inside the Landry' Tower of the Americas restaurant. I don't know if the AC was not working or if their is a design flaw but one would think that the restaurant would insure comfort from the heat with nice AC to go with the fantastic views. The Hummus appetizers are very good and the Mango Mojito was outstanding.,Good,Bad,
"I know the rule generally is that restaurants with a view have second rate food, but this is really taking this too far. The first impression when you walk in is the horrible smell of stale cooking oil. Its overwhelming. Then you are struck by the old decor - looks like they haven't touched the place in 25 years. It feels and smells grimy.You realise the smell of oil is because just about everything they serve is from a deep fryer. Service is patchy as well.
Don't bother, Just go straight to the viewing platform. That is definitely worth a look.",,,Bad
"This restaurant is AWFUL! The view is all that is worth the money and you can look at the observation deck at that rate!
The smallest piece of fish I have ever seen was $33 and when our bill came they said their rates had gone up since menu was printed and charged us $36.99. They waitress said we could substute rice for veggie or potato etc., THEN they charged the extra prices of sides! So a total of $12 over priced on our bill and they acted like it wasnt a big deal and nothing they could do about it.
None of our food was warm enough where butter would melt. Unbelievable. If I am paying $36 for a steak and small amount of potatoes I at least want the butter to melt enough and the food to be a little more than luke warm. This place really has horrible staff, no one could find any guests information and they were telling people that it was hours and hours of waiting time but they had open tables. I wish they would have said that to us because it's the worst restaurant and SUPER SUPER SUPER overpriced, I am telling you the small amount of halibut I have ever seen in my life! Don't go here, it's not worth it! SAVE YOUR MONEY! Go for a drink at happy hour and you wont pay to go up to the observation deck and get a drink. MUCH better idea!",Bad,Good,Bad
"mobile review
Way over-priced; but, you can't beat the view! Hey, its the Tower okay? Mediocre wait and bar staff; Take out of town visitors for a cocktail and a view of the city but save a few hundred dollars by eating elsewhere. Landry's family of restaurants are historically very good and some are excellent. (Vic & Anthony's and Grotto in Las Vegas come to mind). Unfortunately, the Chart House in the Tower of the Americas is a major failure. Truly a disappointment. For adults drinking cocktails, having a steak or lobster with sides and a dessert, expect to drop $100 to $125 per person. Toss in a glass of wine with your steak... and you will exceed $150 per person. Have a cocktail or two and then , go to Ruth's Chris, Bohanan's, the Palm or Pappadeaux's for a better meal with better service. You will probably save enough money to rent a Limo for the evening.",Bad,Good,
I ordered the Snapper Hemingway with a side of Asparagus.  Both were swimming in butter.  As was the side of potatoes my husband ordered.  Service was okay.  Of course you can't beat the location - so unique.  Our favorite is the Lava Cake for dessert.  WELL worth every calorie.,,Good,Good
"It seemed that the restaurant was too busy for its own good as there was several large parties which took out a lot of the wait staff.  Several things that were supposed to come our way did not come or were very late and service was fairly slow.  Food was good but pretty expensive.  The waiter was trying but just seemed to be a bit frazzled.


View is great.  Be advised that when the sun is still up, you will be in the light at some point and it tends to get a bit hot.",Good,Good,Bad
"We returned to Chart House this past weekend during our 17th wedding anniversary getaway.  We certainly remember our first visit being much more pleasurable, which is obviously why we returned for our special weekend.  Just as before, the view was amazing.  We were seated at a very cozy booth and were super excited to see what the evening had in store for us.  Unfortunately the lack luster service quickly turned our excitement into disappointment.  Our server took an extraordinary long time to come over to take our drink order and when he did eventually come over he didn't even greet us or tell us his name.  He didn't offer to tell us about the specials until we asked if there were any. Then when he brought us our food, my order was incorrect.  Overall, our server seemed very uninterested in us or in his job.


The food was ok.  My scallops were overcooked, as was my husband's lobster.  The Lobster Mac and Cheese was very good and I ended up eating that rather than my main course.  We had the Chocolate Lava Cake for dessert and it was good, although on our way out I noticed another couple had the same cake and the kitchen had written ""Happy Anniversary"" on their plate.  Ours didn't have that even though we had mentioned to our server that we were celebrating our anniversary.  Obviously, that other couple's server had arranged the special message with the kitchen and I'm sure that little special attention to detail was much appreciated.  Just another example of how uninterested our server was in making sure our night was special.",Good,Good,Bad
This was one of the worst dining experiences in recent memory. The food was awful- in fact I didn't eat more than a couple of bites; though my wife enjoyed hers'.  The waitress was amazing which is why I didn't complain she was a really nice young lady.  Go up to the top take a look around get a drink but eat elsewhere.,Bad,Good,Good
The scenery was amazing during the hour & ten minute lunch my family observed. The wait staff was friendly & has a very up scale ambience. The only down side is that the food was not worth the price they charge. I guess they have to pay the bill for rotating such a large structure. The strawberry cheesecake was good!,Bad,Good,Good
The view is just beautiful and made the visit worth it.   The staff was good but not outstanding. We weren't given a bread basket  as an example.  The shrimp cocktail was ok but a little tough. The shrimp dinner was outstanding but the Chilean sea bass was ok at best. My daughter didn't like the chicken tenders. This is an expensive restaurant and it is worth going to for the views. I would go again but for wine and an appetizer. I wouldn't spend my money on a full meal.,Bad,Good,Good
"While on vacation here in San Antonio we decided to try this place while at the same time taking in the views from above the city. The view of the city was great, but that's where the greatness ends.  To begin with no one was real helpful in getting us to the restaurant. someone would ask us to wait, while another would say just go on up..So, we decided to take the elevator like recommended. We get up to the top deck and look for the restaurant and it's nowhere to be found. My wife had to call the restaurant and ask how to get there. Finally, someone comes up the elevator to get us and takes us to the right floor.
As we begin to ask for their luncheon menu the server says that's only on the weekdays (11:30am was our arrival time).  On average, the meals were 30.00 on up, which by the way would not be the problem if evening and wanted dinner portions. At any rate, I had free range chicken that was moderately dry and a bit chewy, my wife ordered a spinach salad, but was served a regular side salad (it was returned and right order given).  The only person in our party that was content with her food was our 7 yr old who had chicken tenders and coconut shrimp. 
As far as I'm concerned there are too many good restaurants in San Antonio to spend your money here.  Definitely check out the city from above, but eat somewhere else.",Bad,Good,
The tower has been through various restaurants during its history.  Since none of them were well regarded I never felt the desire to visit. My dining experience last night does not leave me with any desire to return. The food was mediocre and certainly not worth the inflated prices. I saw a neighboring table receive a salad that looked a little old. My partner ordered the prime rib and it was flavorless and the first time out was overcooked. The second offering was tough to cut and chew.  Obviously what they are selling is the view and less care it taken with the food.  The ladies room has only two stalls and feels hot and humid in there. The elevators do not have a/c making for an unpleasant ride when it's 90 degrees outside. Visiting the observation deck is a plus and the historical photos on display are very interesting.,Bad,Good,
"My wife went to the Chart House Restaurant on vacation recently and were warned it was average in advance. The restaurant sits atop a ""revolving"" tower restaurant, (similar to Dallas, Kansas City Etc.) a relic from the 1968 World's Fair. Reservations were easy, same day and we arrived prior to our reservation time, parking is $8.00 and the parking lot (though probably not the fault of the restaurant) is poorly lit and they do not validate (that was not expected anyway). When we arrived the downstairs hostess was disinterested at best and I felt more like I was being questioned by TSA, than by a fine restaurant host. We waited for the elevator for about 5 minutes and were scolded for not standing at the elevator by the attendant, when the elevator arrived. Once we arrived, we were seated pretty quick by a very friendly upstairs hostess. The server was very friendly and gregarious, but her knowledge of the menu lacking and her descriptions of the items, were amateur, apparently not trained well or did not listen to the training. The view was fabulous and so was the appearance of the restaurant and the table. Many of the support staff and gratefully other waiter, were attentive to the lack of water and drink refills. We ordered the humus trio, and it was excellent, I had a lobster soup and my wife had the chopped salad, both more the adequate.  My wife's beef medallions were find and so was her vegetables. Here grilled shrimp smelled (not the way it should). My salmon was horrible, the crab cake was frozen, but my shrimp scampi was excellent, but the starch was cold as well. We ordered the souffle (which was actually good), but the chocolate sauce was nothing to write home about.  I know at a restaurant like this, your going to over pay, our meal was about $125.00 for two, with one drink each, but I would have paid more, for better service and better food. I clearly did not eat the salmon or the crab cake (or potato for that matter) and the server never even asked why? I recommend this place for the view, it is a short walk from the Riverwalk, but go for drinks, apps and souffle, don't waste your money on anything else.",,Good,
"These types of restaurants are always very nice.  Great view, great atmosphere and grossly overpriced.  We went for my mother's birthday at my brother's suggestion.  They treated us well and our server was awesome.  The prices are crazy - you are definitely paying for the ambiance here.  Both my husband and I got the clam chowder and chopped spinach salad.  Both were delicious.  My mom ordered the caesar salad and said it was way too salty.  Go for the views but be prepared to pay.",,Good,Good
"The view was amazing and why I gave 3 stars as the food was just mediocre if not terrible (i.e. the souffl√©).  But the worst was our experience dealing with the girl on the phone while trying to make a reservation.  We couldn't get her to take a reservation for seating next to the window.  First she said twice, like a broken record and that's all she knew, that all seating has a window view when I tried to explain we wanted to be next to the window.  Finally, I said we want to be 'RIGHT ON THE GLASS', which she couldn't spin, so she said that seating was 'NOT GUARANTEED', whatever that meant, clearly another spin.  Fine, I thought, I'll handle it when I get there. 


Then, before dinner that evening we took a trolley ride where the driver was talking about the tower chart house indicating that if one wanted to sit next to a window they should make sure to get their hotel's concierge to make the reservation so it would be guaranteed.  Oh really?


So when we got there, just before 6 pm last Thursday night, I asked for seating on the glass (so there would be no confusion) and was given spin #2 again, that it was not guaranteed when we made our reservation.  Another little b*tc*h to deal with, great.  Thanks Chart House.  The restaurant was practically empty and I pointed this out to her and that their no guarantee on seating policy made it perfect for us earlybirds to get one of the many tables open on the glass.  The girl paused like she was thinking if there was another spin she could use, but couldn't come up with anything, so she went to her little computer area and rewrote something and sent us to a different table, ON THE GLASS.


So not necessary, all it did was sour what should have been a lovely evening.  Chart House - Please change your policies and stop making your hostesses into liars before you ruin anyone else's dinner.",Bad,Good,Bad
"This is an experience restaurant..While in San Antonio it is a must to visit the tower.  Enjoyed our meal and view from the revolving restaurant floor.  We visited the bar before dinner and if were to visit here again would probably just go for the happy hour drinks and appetizers, both were reasonably priced.",Good,Good,
"Granted we did not make reservations.  We arrived at 1pm and put in our name for a table.  We were told 45 minute wait.  One hour later we checked from the lounge and they suggested we go down one floor to restaurant.  The hostess suggested we wait in their waiting area, no time frame was given.  90% of the tables were clean and empty.  We were the only people waiting.  The hostess said they only had three wait staff and they could not handle more than five tables each.  Several employees were standing around acting like they had no work or a promise of a customer.  After being told it would be at least 15-30 minutes longer, AND, after a departing party of three ladies told us they had waited for ever for salads only, we made the decision to leave and walk over to the river walk for a great dining experience.  My advice, go to the observation deck.  Do not waste your time with the non managed Chart House Restaurant!",,,Bad
"We went up to the bar with our small children for happy hour to have an early dinner, after having been informed that the Bar is family friendly. It was a way of getting something to eat and seeing the view.


What we noticed first was that about 3/4 of the bar seating area was cordoned off for pre-booked events, leaving only about tables for everyone else to fight over. One of the cordoned off areas only began to be used as we were leaving. The other one was vacated halfway through out time there, but still regular visitors were not allowed to use it. A Shame.


 When we eventually managed to sit down with our very hungry toddlers, we ordered the happy hour menu - $4 for small sharing plates (the restaurant menu and bar menu outside of happy hour was considerably more). The food arrived and was very tasty. It's a shame we spent the bulk of our time there trying to keep our children away from the long drops over the mezzanine balcony, and avoiding the steep stairs to the restaurant area. 


Good, but not family friendly at all.",Good,Bad,
"Chart House atop the Tower of the Americas is a restaurant that revolves providing a view of the entire San Antonio area about once per hour.  We arrived just before sunset but were seated on the north side of the restaurant and failed to reach West before sunset had completed.  The view of the city by day is rather unimpressive but when darkness falls and the lights come out the view is spectacular.  We began our dinner with drinks and a decent fried ""calamari and friends"" appetizer recommended by our waiter.  The calamari were joined by slices of fried vegetables and a few slices of jalapeno peppers with a citrus sweet-sour type sauce and a thick tomato marinara for dipping.  The sauces were quite small and insufficient for the amount of appetizer provided.  A container of bread followed.  It consisted of one piece of dark bread and one of cornbread, not really enough for two people to each have a choice. For an entree my guest had the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes which were delicious.  I had the New Wave Surf and Turf which consisted of short rib meat with a Cabernet demi-glace and two seared scallops with ginger soy sauce. That entree was delicious as well.  Midway through my entree I discovered what I initially thought was a large piece of onion skin in my mashed potatoes. Closer examination showed that it was instead a portion of plastic piping bag used to pipe mashed potatoes onto the plate.  I pointed it out to the waiter but did not plan to make an issue of the discovery.  He, however, rushed to find the manager who came to the table and apologized profusely offering us a complimentary dessert which we accepted.  We chose the Chart House Grand Marnier Souffl√© with Cr√®me Anglaise.  We understood that the dessert would require 30 minutes to prepare and asked for coffee while waiting.  The waiter refilled our cups a couple of times while we waited.   Time passed and the restaurant made another revolution.  Eventually more than 30 minutes had passed and the coffee had grown cold.  We asked the waiter to check on the Souffl√© but he simply said ""it takes 30 minutes"" yet no dessert appeared.  Finally, after waiting close to an hour from the time the manager promised the complimentary dessert,  we gave up and asked for our check and left.  Since our waiter had not been by the table for some time at that point we had to go to the hostess station to make our request.  They seemed somewhat flustered by our decision to forego continuing to wait for the elusive Souffl√© but we had been waiting close to an hour from the time the manager said he was putting in the order and we had other things to do. It would have been a more memorable meal had the restaurant simply apologized for the plastic and left it at that.  To promise something else and fail to deliver is not what one wants to remember about an otherwise delicious meal.",Good,Good,Bad
"I just had a business dinner for 14 at the Chart House this week and was less than thrilled.  The view is great and the facility is nice enough but certainly not fancy. However the service was not very attentive and the food was ok.
When I made the reservation I spoke with a manger and said I wanted us to be next to the window and was promised that this would be done. NOT. So we were seated on the second level where there is almost no room at all. Between my back and the rotating wall there was less than 2 feet and this is the path for all the service staff and all the customers.  At one time in the middle of our dinner everyone at the wall had to get up so a mom and her small stroller could get through.",Good,Good,Bad
As soon as we got off the elevator there was a funky smell and we should have taken that as a sign. We ordered hot tea because it was cold out. The tea arrived luke warm. The bread was literally bright yellow. We both ordered chicken francese which was overlooked and floating on a pool of oil. Although I was hungry it was too oily and overcooked to eat. The waiter was nice and reasonably attentive. Pricey for food that was marginal at best.,Bad,Bad,Good
"This restaurant has magnificent views of SA but not worth $100+. The appetizers and cocktails were amazing. However, the service is awful. The main course was barely warm. I wasn't provided any suggestions or anything since it was my first time visiting. I had one bite from my main course.  The server didn't even ask how was everything.  He brought the check and disappeared. I would suggest that anyone should pass the restaurant and go directly to the bar.",,Good,Bad
"My wife and I went to San Antonio for a small break from everyday life in Houston, and its only about a 3 1/2 hour drive, an easy trip for an escape. I made reservations at the Chart House before we left, for the first night in San Antonio, since my wife hadn't ever been there. I did warn her before we went that the food would be okay, but it was the ambiance/view that made it worth while, and I wasn't to far off. We got there a bit early for our reservation and decided to have a glass of wine and an appetizer at the lounge, and they have a nice Happy Hour. The only problem I noticed was the type of music they were playing, which was some form of Euro music, certainly not romantic and not fitting for a special occasion restaurant in the USA, don't know what Landry's is thinking. We decided to be seated for our dinner reservation and had a great table, which it appears all are excellent. I wasn't impressed at all with the wine list, which was heavily weighed with CA wines, and we decided on one of the few none CA wines, an Argentine malbec, which was good. Time to order dinner and the menu seemed ordinary, not a lot of imagination. I ordered the free range chicken and my wife ordered the salmon. Our food came and my chicken was good and my wife asked me to try her salmon, and my impression, I couldn't eat it, it was so salty, and just what she thought too. We told our waitress, but found out it would take at least 12 minutes to make her a new one, so she decided to eat everything else but the salmon. The restaurant manager came over and we told him as well the salmon was extremely salty and my wife just couldn't eat it. He said he would have a talk with the chef. He came back and said he tasted the salmon and agreed it was to salty to eat and took it off our bill. He did offer us a free dessert, but we passed and called it a night. Fortunately we did have an appetizer at the lounge before dinner, so my poor wife didn't starve. So the moral of the story, the Chart House is a great place to go for a view of San Antonio, but our recommendation would be to go to the lounge and have a drink or two with some appetizers and skip having dinner, until Landry's changes the music and makes the restaurant menu worthwhile.",Bad,Good,
We had a 12:45 reservation and didn't get out until 2:15 for lunch and we ordered as soon as we got there. The French Dip was loaded with fat. Waiter was the absolute worst. My water glass stayed empty after I finished it the first time. Manager came by to check on us and I kindly told her the food was taking forever... never saw her again.,Bad,,Bad
I will start with the positive.  The view is outstanding from 750' above the city.  And the service tried.  Other than that we experienced many of the same things others did.  A long walk back to the downtown area through a dark and sketchy park with NO police presence (kind of typical for SA it seems).  A Chart House signature dish (Ahi tuna) was out at 7 pm on a Sunday...that's a shame.  Both my and my wife's meals came out cold.  We questioned saying something when the manager came to ask if everything was to our liking fortunately we did but it didn't change much.  The Chilean Sea Bass I had was over encrusted and took away from the flavor of the fish.  My wife had a seafood trio of which she finished none of the proteins. we were seated next to a server station and I asked a specific question about the use of the station and was assured it was not utilized often.  Well this is where they sort silverware.  Quite bothersome.  Bottom line is that the better option is to take the elevator (the free one) to the bar and have a drink at 601 like we had the day before.  have an app and beverage and enjoy the view.  The restaurant is a weak attempt at fine dining.  It's just overpriced dining. Oh and like others have said...it is very very dark inside.,Bad,Good,Good
The food was average and overpriced.  The view made it tolerable. This would be a great place for dessert.,Bad,Good,
"My boyfriend and I enjoyed the view when we ate here for lunch on my birthday.  The restaurant is inside the tower of the Americas and overlooks the city of San Antonio while slowly rotating, giving you a full view.  The food was OK, and way overpriced, no lunch menu option.  The fondu was delicious but seemed microwaved.  I ordered the quail as my entree, with an oversized side of creamed spinach that also looked microwaved.  The quail was smothered in a BBQ sauce and tasted good however it was plated on top of wilted lettuce.  They baked us a lava cake fresh, it was topped with ice cream and chocolate sauce; it was very rich and tasty.  Our server wished me a happy birthday and was friendly but they only refilled my tea once.  The lack of presence by the server led me to refill my cup on my own at one point.  Overall it was nice because of the view, but I won't go back here to eat.  Way overpriced.",,Good,Good
"As you ride the elusive elevator up the tower, a recording warns that a memorable experience awaits.  If we'd known how memorable it would truly be, we would've turned around immediately.  


First let me say that I always reference TripAdvisor before making a reservation and wish I had this time.  We have a Chart House in Colorado that we love and we're also Landry's members so I did not expect such a difference from location to location.  We were a party of five, with a reservation.  After waiting 10+ minutes for the lone elevator, we checked in a second time at the restaurant.  Party after party was seated and after 15 minutes or so, we asked for the status.  We were almost immediately seated at a long table, where we sat side by side.  Yes, we were able to enjoy the view but conversing with each other proved to be difficult and awkward due to the table configuration.   Sadly, things did not improve from here.  Our waitress was difficult to find, welcoming us after we'd been waiting quite awhile.  They were out of the appetizer we requested, placed onions on my salad though I'd asked for those to be held, then insisted (even though you could clearly see all of the red onions in the salad) that ""unfortunately our dressing has a strong onion flavor"", and any request took a very long time to deliver (more horseradish, etc).  We were also put out that, as we ate our salad/soup course, bread was not offered.  As we enjoyed the smells of bread from the tables next to ours, we finally flagged down our waitress to ask and were told that bread is ""by request only"".  Why would a restaurant in this price range not automatically offer bread?


After a not very satisfying dining experience we were told that we could further view the city from the observation deck.  We decided to take a look and after a walk around, we wanted to be on our way as our toddler was fussy and ready for bed.  The elevator took ages to arrive.  Seriously, ages.  And, we were told that there was only room to accommodate four of the five of us.  The elevator attendant held the elevator and demanded that someone get off before she could proceed.  Our baby was upset and there stood a Chart House employee, uniform and all.  If she were my employee, I would've been very upset had she not stepped off to allow customers with an upset child to ride.  But this is the general feel of the place and of the staff so we weren't surprised.  We then asked if we could just take the steps and were told that we could not and would have to wait on the elevator to return once again.  So, there we were, waiting and waiting once again.  


I've been to revolving ""top of the tower"" restaurants in St. Louis and Atlanta and have always had positive experiences and never had such trouble arriving and departing.  The tower is disappointing as is the restaurant.  Would not recommend to anyone and Landry's/Chart House should be ashamed.",,Bad,Bad
"The view was the best part of the Chart House.  The food was good but not hot even though we weren't even halfway through our salads before the server announced our entree ""was ready"" and she removed the half eaten salads without even asking to bring the entrees.  We were given our salads back on smaller plates so they could ""fit on the table"" along with the entrees which clearly had already been waiting to be brought to the table.  The food was barely warm.  Our waiter asked four times if we wanted one of the specialty deserts because they had to be prepared in advance.  We had told him no thanks at his first request but he persisted.  He also recommended the most expensive appetizer and entree and tried to interest us in a membership card for the restaurant group even after we explained that only one of the restaurants in the chain was available locally.  He behaved more like a high pressure salesperson than a waiter and it nearly ruined a meal already pretty much destroyed by a rude and unprofessional server. 


The Tower of the Americas where the Chart House sits is a remnant of the 1968 worlds fair.   The rest of the remnants comprise Hemisphere park.  It's a collection of boarded up buildings in what looks like the bad part of town but that pretty much describes the whole of San Antonio with the exception of a portion of the Riverwalk choked with TexMex, baroque and pseudo Italian restaurants, none of which were any better than palatable.  Skip the entire city if you can.",Bad,Good,Bad
"The view at the Chart House is great but the meal was not a great experience.


I think the menu has a lot of potential at The Chart House but it seems like most of the restaruants I have been to that are at the top of a rotating building struggle in terms of the service and the meal.  Maybe it is the logistics, tight space or difficulty in filling seats but something seems to plague most of these styles of restaruants.


The issues began with the elevator ride up.  Our business group of 8 was split into three groups in order to make it to the top.  It seemed like there was only one elevator running and it was shared with people going to the observation deck and the restaurant/bar.  This was pretty crazy that it took three trips to get our group to the top.


Once up there the view is great but after that things went down hill.  There is an issue with the air handling where there is cold air blasting on you all night (at least where we were sitting on the upper deck).  We complained and they said they would turn it down but we did not notice any difference for the 2 hours we were there.  The waiter was delayed in getting to us but wait staff did take our drink orders (they seemed short staffed in general).  When the drinks came they gave several mixed drinks to the wrong people so they had to switch drinks.  We ordered appetizers and they took a while to come but they were good (shirimp cocktail the hummus and chips).  The salads and soups took about 20 minutes to arrive after the appetizers and then dinner was another 15 after that so there was no flow to the meal.  Desserts took anoter 15 after we finihsed dinner.  The main courses for several people had issues.  One steak was over-cooked, parts of several meals (green beans, potatoes) were cold and my Tuna steak was only mildly warm and a little dried out.  It just seemed like they struggled to keep up on all fronts and the restaruant was less than 1/2 full.  The wait staff seemed to be working hard but they were inexperienced and maybe that is the issue for the entire restaruant.  They did have a manager come around at the end and ask how it was and we probably should have laid out our issues but at that point the group was ready to get out from the cold air so we just paid and left.  As I mentioned at the beginning, the menu has a lot of good options and I think with some work on timing, service and food temperature the Char House could be good but on the night we went, it did not go well",Bad,Good,Bad
"The Chart House was just OK, and for the price I expected better.


The food:  I ordered the pear and saga blue cheese salad, but  they forgot the cheese.  They did eventually bring me some after I pointed out the omission.  My husband's Chilean Sea Bass Beurre Noisette, (from the Fall menu,) was OK, but rather flavorless.  I had the Autumn Spiced Scallops, (also from the Fall menu.)  The scallops themselves were OK, but the sauce and red cabbage were too sweet, and tasted too much like apple or pumpkin pie spices.


Atmosphere:  We arrived just after dark.  You can see city lights, but an after dark view isn't that great.  The restaurant is very poorly lit, and it's really hard to read the menu.  I had to take the electric votive candle out so I could read, and I saw several other tables doing the same.


Rather than eat here for your special dinner, why not take the ride to the observation deck before dark, then go somewhere else to eat?",,Bad,
"Stopped in on 10/25/13 for drinks and dessert--it was our anniversary and wanted to end our evening with a special treat.  Was rudely told at the hostess stand that with no reservations, it would be a 30-min wait for a table in the revolving restaurant.  Okay, we get that, but how about offering a viable alternative?  We went up to the bar/lounge area ourselves and finally got some attention from the bartender.  Terrible service and had to wait an unbelievable amount of time for the 2 desserts we ordered; there was an error in the kitchen and one dessert was not prepared to come out with the other one.  No apologies, and we seemed liked such a bother for the the bartender--and why was he serving us at a table and not one of the MULTIPLE servers running around the lounge (with only 3-4 tables occupied, the staff was tripping over themselves).  Not happy with the service and ended up being an expensive downer for our evening.",,,Bad
Well the view is the best in town but after that we had a number of Bads. Were delighted to find they were part of the Landry's group. Took FOREVER just to order a drink and have it brought to us. We decided we had better go ahead and order rather than wait. Again forever to have our food delivered. Steak was tasty but not even close to being at correct trmp.. Was barely warm.  From the time we gave the waiter our credit card until he returned it was 25 minutes. We had started timing him by this point because it was comical.  This was  during the week and  they were not busy.  I hope if we ever return corrections have been made because the venue is wonderful.,,Good,Bad
"Took my newly minted Airman for lunch here expecting it would be a memorable meal.
Unfortunately, other than the amazing 360 degrees view of San Antonio, the food was average at best and the service was slow.
We ordered 2 appetizers Humus (skip it) and Fried Calamari (pretty good).
For main courses, we ordered steak, Medium, and it was well done at best; since it took so long to get to the table my son didn't want to wait any longer for his meal. We also ordered the Seafood platter and while it was good, the Mash Potatoes were Stone Cold and un-edible; so bad that we actually received a credit on the check.
I've been to many Chart House restaurant Miami, San Juan, Maui and while pricey I always had a great meal..Maybe the kitchen staff as having a bad day.",Bad,Good,Bad
My plate was dirty and it was not from my food. The service was atrocious and could not count our change correctly. Food was served cold. Waiter was rude. It was hot in the restaurant. We had to wait a really long time to get an elevator down. I will not go back.,Bad,Bad,Bad
Service was hurried and inattentive. We hadn't finished our salad when the entrees arrived. We had ordered dessert and our server forgot so we had to wait another 30 minutes for the lava cake. At least we got to see the sunset.,,Good,Bad
"We go to the Tower restaurant once a year because it's a family tradition, but tonight's visit left these locals utterly unimpressed!


Two children's meals, one adult entree (the fried fish/seafood combo with 4 shrimp, 2 inedible and mushy fish blobs, one soggy frozen breaded lobster tail, a couple calimari and limp fries), one iced tea and a single dessert cost more than $72-- and that was before the tip!?


The server was pleasant but had to be asked to refill the iced tea more than once. 


The restaurant windows (presumably the real draw here, since the scenery obviously outranks the food) were badly smeared (on the inside!?) and the vent next to our table was noisy and rattled badly throughout the meal. 


There's ample reason that this restaurant is no more popular than it is, and why more locals don't frequent the place! Go once if you must, to say that you did--but then save your dining out budget for the many more-deserving, far better and less tourist-exploiting restaurants San Antonio has to offer!",Bad,Bad,Good
"My husband and I ate here for our 5 year anniversary. The view is always beautiful; if it weren't for that, I would have given it one or two stars. It's been a few years since we were last here and in my opinion, it's going downhill. Please keep in mind that for my review, the restaurant was not crowded while we were there. After being seated, it was at least 10 minutes before we were acknowledged and drink orders were taken. It was another 10 minutes before we got our drink order of plain ice water. We saw our waiter maybe twice as other servers delivered the food and drinks. Our waiter never came back to check and see if we needed anything. Our bill was over $100 for two people and I expect much better service than that for the price. I can overlook a lot but at the end of a romantic dinner when the waiter returned with the check, we were given a very awkward credit card sales pitch for 5 minutes. What a joke! I think next time we have something important to celebrate, we'll go elsewhere.",,Good,Bad
"Was looking forward to dinner here as the restaurant is in a rotating needle sort of thing.  The views were very nice, our table was good but the meal was average at best and the service was annoying.  If you want to eat your meal and have your conversation interrupted continually by a 12 year looking waiter then this is the place for you.  I will never understand why staff isn't trained to read a social situation.  This isn't take out so why are you hovering over us while we DINE?


I've eaten in at least three other Chart Houses on the east coast over the years and this was by far the worst in terms of service, value and quality of food.  We ordered an appetizer and a bottle of wine.  The calamari was grossly over breaded and tasteless.  It might have been warm when served but by the time junior was done figuring out how to open the bottle of wine they were stone cold and had to be sent back.


The menu selections were more limited than I remember from previous experiences at other Chart House's and the combinations were not to my tastes.  After being interrupted at least three more times about ""are we ready to order"" (he didn't get the hint when I said I'd make eye contact when we were ready), we finally ordered the New Wave or New Age Surf and Turf.  The beef brisket as good but I requested light on the sauce and it was smothered in sauce.  I ordered scallops as the surf and there was an anemic looking piece of salmon on my plate!  Had to send it back.  When I finally got my scallops they were small and tasteless, poorly prepared and served.  I had an order of asparagus with my dinner, thinking, ""it's spring it should be fresh and yummy.""  Wrong, it was over cooked and tasteless as well, like something you'd get at a smorgasbord or Old Country Buffet.  Very disappointing.  


My days of going to a Chart House are over.  I won't spend the kind of money I did and be served the poor quality and tasteless food we had last night.  There are too many other options out there.  Bon Voyage Chart House.",Bad,Good,Bad
"My spouse and I went to the Chart House Restaurant this past Monday for Happy Hour.  We sat at a table adjacent to the bar and clearly within eyesight of the servers and bar-tenders.  When we arrived we sat ourselves as virtually no one else was in the establishment.  We were give the bar menu and left to sit for nearly 10 minutes prior to me determining that if anyone was going to serve us, I would need flag someone down.  Someone took our order and we sat for another 10-15 minutes before I had to flag someone down again to get our glasses of wine.  We had appetizers that were good, but needed to continuously needed to find a server if we wanted another glass of wine or any other type of service.  The happy hour prices and view are good, but understand that this is clearly a tourist restaurant/bar with servers that believe it is the customers priviledge to be there.",Good,Good,Bad
"Location is great. Views are fantastic. The revolving restaurant takes 1:15 hours to make a full turn so if you are unlucky and seated on the wrong side, you might not even see downtown (which is the only cool thing to see from up there). The waiters were great. The hostess took forever to give out tables and the restaurant was all empty..",,Good,
"We went up for lunch but they do not serve lunch on Saturdays.  We both got the platter which consisted of calamari, tempura lobster, battered fish and french fries and it was very over priced.  The lobster was greasy and the batter heavy.  So disappointing.  If not for the view this would have been the worst part of our visit to San Antonio.",Bad,Good,
"My wife and I celebrated our 25th anniversary this weekend in downtown San Antonio, and were looking for a good seafood restaurant with atmosphere. We have eaten at other Chart House's across the country and never been disappointed, and having dinner in a revolving restaurant at the top of the Tower of the Americas seemed to fit the bill. 
Unfortunately, the food was atrocious. We ordered stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, and neither one of us have ever eaten a stuffed mushroom we didn't like until last night. The stuffing was runny and fishy and frankly inedible. We ordered the chopped salad because it sounded so good on the menu, but when it arrived it looked like someone had regurgitated it onto the plate, and tasted like three day old salad, terrible. My wife ordered a salmon and shrimp scampi dish that was also inedible and I ordered the stuffed (mistake) flounder. Although the flounder was okay, the stuffing, again soupy and fishy, ruined the dish completely.
Our waiter, Ace, was outstanding to the point of wonderful. The wine was good. The view is spectacular, and the atmosphere with good. However, it was a little scary walking to the tower from our hotel on the river.
This place will stay open if only because of the Chart House's reputation and the spectacular setting, but they had better get a new chef, pronto. Oh, and the prices were far from cheap.",Bad,Good,Good
"I don't know if it was an off night as the waiter suggested, but the restaurant that has the best views of San Antonio sitting atop a revolving tower high above the city, had the WORST food and evidently management, that I have experienced in that price range EVER!


The calamari was soggy and fishy tasting.  The sea bass ran out before our dinner was served, but we weren't informed of this until about 30-45 minutes AFTER our order for it was placed.  The shrimp dinner wouldn't beat your grocer's freezer's best brand of pre-cooked, ready to heat box meals.  They didn't even comp the chocolate lava cake after our voicing complaints.


I would recommend going for drinks at the bar and enjoying the view before dinner elsewhere when you visit San Antonio.",Bad,Good,Bad
"It took 3 hours for a dinner that arrived basically cold and bland.  Would not advise anyone to come here for dinner with so,many other places that are actually really good.  Just go to bar for a dink and view.  Just do happy hour but beware here.  I ordered a drink 10 minutes brfore happy hour ended and it came 15 minutes later and had to fight to gete HH price.",Bad,Good,Bad
"We enjoyed our meal at chart house because of our awesome table and view and our waiter was so great. However, our food was just ok. Not bad but not out of this world.",,Good,Good
"The view was fantastic HOWEVER a restaurant is about the service and the food and both were lacking.  I felt like we had been pushed back to the 80s as the waiter was all about upselling us  rather than making sure we had a Good.  I had a modern day surf and turf, the short ribs reminded me of an overcooked pot roast (though the glaze was nice) and the scallops were cold.  No one returned to our table from the time the dinner was placed in front of us until the plates were ready to be removed.  When I told the waiter that the scallops were cold, he asked if I wanted another order..when I said no, I had already eaten the cold ones...that was the end of that.  My husbands flounder was rather luke warm as well.  It took a long time to get the food, so I suspect it was sitting there for a while.  We ordered the souffle prior to our dinner, when it came - it too was disappointing tasting like wet egg whites, it had no flavour and was far too wet inside.
I was asked when I made the reservation if we were celebrating something special, so I shared that it was my husbands birthday.  I'm not sure why they asked as it wasn't mentioned during our stay.
Near the end of our experience, a fire alarm went off.  Not a pleasant feeling when you are over 70 stories in the air.  The watier said not to worry, it happens all the time.  Ok?  
We have lived in Europe for the past several years and my husband wasn't familiar with the brand, before going I told him I had been to Chart House years ago when I lived in Florida and it was a top of the line restaurant.  Apparently things have changed.  I am happy to pay for great food and service, unfortunately the price/value relationship was out of wack here.
I will end as I started, the view was spectacular.  The restaurant experience got in the way however.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The restaurant was sorta dark.  Then when the room rotated to a light we could see.  Our server, Chris was Outstanding .  The food is pricey and not really worth the price but again guess you are also paying for the view.  Meal includes free tour of observation deck.  But if you drink at the bar and to not have dinner there, you must pay to visit observation deck.  The prices of drinks, you would think they would not charge to go to observation deck.",Bad,Good,Good

We decided to go to the bar for Happy Hour.  The Bar is located just above the Restaurant.  The best thing about the whole visit was being able to go up the towers for free.  The view is - of course - spectacular.  If you go just before sunset, you will be able to enjoy the view during day light and at night.
The bar was busy upon our arrival, so we decided to sit at one of the comfortable tables.  After 15 minutes of waiting and not being greeted by a server, we saw that there were two seats available at the bar.  It took 12 minutes for the bartender to notice us, but when he did, he was super apologetic and nice.  He immediately took our order and poured our drinks.  The glassware from the previous customers were not cleared during our entire visit.  
Happy Hour consists of a special menu of select appetizers, cocktails, beer and wine.  The drink prices are between $3 and $7.  The Pomegranate Mojito and Margarita were nothing spectacular in flavor.  
There is also a special Appetizer menu.  We ordered the Hummus Trio served with pita and plantain chips, the Steamed Mussels with garlic, tomatoes and white wine and the Ahi Nachos served atop fried wontons with pickled ginger and wasabi cream.  The Hummus Trio was delicious.  The fried plantains added a nice touch.  The steamed mussels were salty and fishy.  Okay, I know that mussels taste a bit fishy, but this was a little too much for my taste.  The raw Ahi was served at room temperature and the fried Wontons were a bit soggy, almost as if the dish had been pre-prepped.  Now I do understand that this is a happy hour menu, but I would hope that a chef takes even this small menu serious as a representation of his skills.
Our bartender was very sweet and attentive, making up for our initial wait, and maybe even for the glassware that was never cleared.  He did have a busser, but it was obvious that the busser wasn't doing much of anything.  We sat next to the server drink pick up area and unfortunately noticed a lot of arguing between employees/servers.  
Perhaps the biggest put off was that accept for the bartender we were never acknowledged by any other employees rushing right past us.  The employees seemed unhappy and frazzeled.  
Would we go back? Yes, most certainly for the view.  Maybe even to give them another chance.",,Good,Bad
"We're locals and were on a Birthday Weekend in Downtown SA.  We thought we'd be safe going to a tourist restaurant that was also a Chart House as we've had several great meals with wonderful service in other Chart House locations.


At the base of the Tower, the hostess could not operate the touch panel controlled reservation screen and after many, many minutes of trying, finally asked for help.  That level of competence carried through the balance of the evening.


The view was great but the server was quite inexperienced though friendly.  The salads were mediocre at best and my Medallions and Shrimp were cold and the shells were impossible to remove from the shrimp.  I was forced to peel them by hand which would normally be embarrassing except the overall experience was par with an eat-with-your-hands type of restaurant.


At least it was expensive‚Ä¶ LOL!",Bad,,Bad
"I came here a year ago and had an excellent, memorable birthday dinner, and out of all the restaurants on the River Walk, I decided to come back to the Chart House for my birthday.  I called and made reservations on a Sunday for 5 minutes later and was able to get in right away, whereas other people who just walked up were told it was a 45 minute wait.  Last time, I had walked up and was told it was 45 minutes too. When I got to the restaurant, there were several empty tables around me that never got filled both times, so I wonder if they just like to give the illusion of being in-demand and special.  


I got a table next to the window and got the enjoy a wonderful view of the city before the sunset.  The view makes it worthwhile. The dinner rolls are also really good. I ordered the Lobster & Shrimp Spring roll appetizer which has cabbage, cucumber and fine cappellini noodles wrapped in a soft (not fried) rice paper wrapper ($13). It came with a citrus chili dipping sauce which was so-so.  I ordered two glasses of white wine and the Macadamia Crusted Mahi ($32).  It comes with green beans but no pasta or potato.  Unfortunately, the fish was cold and a bit raw and even though I enjoy some sushi, it was just wrong for this type of dinner.  The waiter never came back to check on how my dinner was or within waving over distance for the entire time I ate my entree, so I was unable to get the problem fixed so that definitely put a damper on the meal.  I had ordered the Hot Chocolate Lava Cake dessert ($11) when I ordered my entree (30 minutes needed for preparation).  That was very rich, good, and large enough for two.  I had to get part of it to-go since I could not finish it.   With tip, my dinner for one was around $100.  For that kind of price, I do expect better service and a warm entree.  Given the other reviewers complaining about cold food, it seems like a relatively common occurance.


The view of San Antonio is fantastic, so maybe if you made reservations and just came for appetizers and dessert, it would be better.  Although you are paying for the view, I do wish the food and service was up to par with the prices, since this could be the best restaurant in San Antonio if it were.


Tip:  Call for reservations well before sunset, so you have time to see the entire skyline plus go down to the Observation level.   After dinner, on the elevator ride back down, you can stop for free and see the Tower of America's Observation floor with mural pictures listing what the various buildings are and historical pictures of Texas and the the army forts.  Normally, you would have to pay $11 to go up to the Observation level.",Bad,Good,Bad
Attending the restaurant was a huge let down. If you have high expectations for this restaurants they will e immediately shot down. We ordered the calamari and it was cold as was the marinara sauce it came with. We also ordered 2 cups of clam chowder and the waiter only brought one . When he finally returned 20 minutes later he told us he thought we were going to share! Who shares soup?!? Then the seasonal  mahi Marsala I ordered came with only 2 tiny pieces of mushrooms. It was fresh but not worth the price tag at all. My friend ordered the blackened snapper and he had to pick out scales! The fish was not cleaned properly! Do not go to the chart house. Save your money and go shopping at the outlets!! It was not worth it!,Bad,,Bad
"We decided we wanted to go back to the Tower to celebrate our 40th - since we had our wedding dinner there.  I read all the terrible reviews, almost decided to go somewhere else, but in the end we stuck with our plans.


We did not run into many of the issues other reviewers mentioned.  They had our reservations, we were seated about 5 minutes after we arrived in the restaurant, we were given a roomy both with a great view, our menu was annotated ""Happy 40th Anniversary"" with our names at the top, and our server was very attentive (almost trying too hard - but better than being ignored).  Everyone we met was friendly and efficient.


But then you get to the food.  I ordered the big steak, and my wife ordered a fish entree.  This is a Landry's property and you pay Landry's prices so you expect the food to be like Landry's - but it's not.  Both meals were so -so and both were stone cold - not even a hint of warm.


Tons of reviews have criticized the Chart House and as far as I can see management has never responded and they certainly haven't made any changes as far as the food goes.


If it wasn't for the tourists who don't know better, and sentimental people like me, they would go broke.

"Our group of 11 people arrived at the Chart House restaurant atop the Tower of the Americas 25 minutes before our reservation. They had no record of our reservation but were not busy.  It was not a Good. My husband‚Äôs food was cold, and after returning it received back a plate of tough,  rubbery scallops (obviously microwaved to death). My food was also cold, but the steak portion of the plate (about ¬º of the food) was cooked medium rare as specified, so I did not dare to return it.  I had ordered vegetables instead of potatoes; they gave me mashed potatoes, no veg, and the potatoes were cold and pasty. Everyone at the table had pretty much the same experience with their food; the person sitting to my left ate almost nothing because his seafood platter was cold, overcooked, and greasy. Another couple complained about the food and service to the manager; she just shrugged off their complaint and gave the excuse that the waiter was new. The cost was way out of line with the produce; we had been promised two free appetizers; four were ordered for 11 people and every one of the 6 tickets was charged for half an appetizer. We ordered a second glass of wine, specifying the ‚Äúhappy hour cabernet‚Äù a few minutes before the end of happy hour and the server did not say anything to the contrary--but when the bill arrived we were charged $12 each. Our total bill for a poor meal for the two of us, with poor service and indifferent wine, including the not-optional 20% tip, was $140. The next night we ate at Boudros on the Riverwalk, had superb food with excellent, friendly, fast and professional service for $72 total. Go figure. Or just to go Boudros or Acenar, in our opinion the two best restaurants on the Riverwalk. Being up in a tower is not worth getting scammed.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"My husband and I met our friends for dinner at the Chart House, on 11/10/2012. Three of us ordered the stuffed flounder. Bad choice. Portion was small and not seasoned well. Meal also came with mash potatoes and asparagus. Mash potatoes were terrible. The third person ordered steak. It wasn't the best either. In total our bill was $200. The quality and portion of the meals were not worth $200. We will not be dining at Chart House again.",Bad,,
"My husband surprised me by making reservations for our first wedding anniversary. I thought great choice! We were seated and handed menus. My husband had to inform them he had reserved special menus. He had gone a few days earlier and requested personalized menus at an additional cost. You would think that because reservations were made and he made the arrangements ahead of time they would have handed us the correct menus. He was very disappointed that he had to point it out instead of it being a pleasant surprise. He also requested a cake, again for an additional fee. Instead of our waiter being informed about this he was offering us dessert off the menu. So again my husband had to inform him which was  another ruined  pre-planned surprise. the food was excellent and the view was beautiful. The prices were to be expected. But our overall experience was quite a disappointment. My husband put quite a bit of thought into what we should do for our celebration only to regret his choice. I'm sure he will be contacting management.",Good,Bad,Bad
"We visited the Chart House to celebrate our first wedding anniversary.  We were married on the Stratosphere in Las Vegas and thought that it would cool to celebrate on this tower.  Making reservations was painless due to their website process, it even sent reminders.   Our waiter was charming, informative, and very attentive, at first.


We ordered steak and a seafood dish.  My steak came, and the waiter insisted that I cut it in the middle to insure that it was cooked correctly; good call, because it was cooked medium instead of rare ( I even said rare, rare to impress my desire for RARE).  He promptly took the steak back, leaving my wife to eat alone.  Another steak was delivered by the manager 5 or 6 minutes later, it was cooked perfectly.  I did explain to him my disappointment on this special day.  He apologized.


My wife's fish and vegetables were wonderful, she loved them.  My steak was coated with salt, it was almost inedible, in fact I couldn't finish it.  I also ordered corn on the cob.  It appeared to have been boiled for hours instead of minutes, the kernels were shriveled and tasted like mush.  In the middle of eating my dish, the manager returned, notifying me that  he would take care of my meal.  I decided that I didn't want to express my dissatisfaction further.


Our waiter asked if we wanted anything else, and when we said no, he became MIA.  After waiting 30 minutes for the check, I was able to get his attention and requested it.  After many more minutes he delivered it and then again disappeared.  Finally, I had to call out to him to persuade him to run my credit card, which he did after several more minutes.......",Bad,,
"This might be a fun experience at the top of Tower of the Americas IF the restaurant rotated. However, that level was undergoing ""maintenance"" and we weren't told when we made the reservation. We only found out when we arrived for dinner. Without the view, the restaurant is just so so. The steaks were heavily salted, as were the baked potatoes. We ordered a side dish that didn't show up with our meal and by the time the server realized it, we were well into the steaks and told her to skip it. The strangest thing about this place is that every time one of the staff walked down the aisle behind our table, our whole booth shook like an earthquake. Without the rotation, the place has no ""hook"" and is way too expensive to bother with. Skip this place unless you are going for a great view and the restaurant is rotating. Check first before you show up.",,Good,Bad
"This is the place for tourists and maybe romantic couples who wants to dine at an unusual location. Booking a table is done through their website, very fast and easy. 
To get to the top you take the elevator outside the tower and enjoy the view on the way up. The view is of course spectacular, can not say the same about the wine selection. It is at best acceptable to accompany the seafood on the menu.  
One of the starters we sampled was the ""East Meet West Tuna"", was not good. The tuna was unfortunatly far from fresh. (Our suspicion to the fish turned out to be right an hour after the visit.) 
The main course, fish, was very good, so was the wine even though we woudl have appriciated a larger selection.  
The service started off good but the waiter seemed to lose interest after a while. 
It is a bit cramped around the tables for 4, sitting in a semicircle so the entire party can enjoy the fantastic view.


All in all, an ok placewith ok food where you go more for the view than the food and comfort around the tables.
Kind of a ""have been there place"" you want to do once.",,Good,

I order a Caesar salad and it wasssssssssss SALTY SALTY! then I order a BLT Sandwiched YUCK YUCK and I asked for some Mineral Water, and they gave a frosted glass which had a strong vinegar odor ( i know they use it to clean) and everything BUT COME ON! it was drinking for a bottle of white vinegar!

"Our granddaughter wanted to go out for a nice dinner for her thirteenth birthday so we chose Chart House, thinking it would be special for her. Boy were we wrong. We had reservations for 830 and arrived on time.  We were told it would be a minute to seat us. Twenty minutes later we were told they were putting the finishing touches on our table. Fifteen minutes later we were seated. Our daughter had ordered special menus with our granddaughter's name printed on them, but we had to ask for them instead of them already being on the table, and they were printed wrong.  The food took forever and was mediocre at best. When the staff delivered our food, they argued in front of us over how the seats are numbered at the table and were giving us the wrong plates. My daughter talked to the manager several times but all she did was giggle and offered nothing in the way of explanation or compensation.  The $40 special order birthday cake tasted like it had been in the freezer for months.  All in all a very unpleasant experience and we will never return.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I took my family to this place to cap off the weekend of my son's air force graduation. 1) No Parking to be found even though we had reservations for 2 days. We parked in an unsecured residential area 10 blocks away. 2) The hostess tried to seat our party of 5 at a small table. After 15 minutes, a manager overturned the decision and gave us a nice big table. 3) THE FOOD WAS COLD AND THE ORDERS WERE WRONG for 2 of the dinners. When you send something back in a nice restaurant, the atmosphere of the celebration is lost because someone is not going to eat with the others. Also, no busboys mean no water for the guests. 4) My complaint was met with a ""what would you like me to do?"" look from the manager. She remove a couple of items from the check but dinner and the party was ruined. I had budgeted $500 for this party so I really didn't care about the money. 5) The view was nice. But the sun setting means very bright glare and an unusually hot climate in the restaurant. In hind sight, we should have gone to this place for dessert after a nicer dinner at a better run restaurant.",Bad,Good,Bad
At first waitress was always at our table...a little too much..then after food was brought she disappreard.  We waited 30 minutes for her to come give up our reciept and then another 45 minutes for her to return with the credit card.  She also kept stepping on my feet everytime she come over--even though I kept moving them futher under the table she kept doing it.  I understand that they want you to make a complete rotation but we ended up about 1 1/2 times around.,,,Bad
"We were told down at the Tower of the Americas lobby the waiting list for the restaurant was 30 minutes. Hubby and I agreed that was fine we could have a drink in the bar first and maybe have an appetizer. Well just to get served was terribly unpleasant. We finally had to ask a server among one of the 4 that kept buzzing past us if we could get a drink order in. It was like ""Oh yeah, sure!"" So a guy came over and took our drink order. That was the last we saw of him. We then asked another person at the bar if we could order an appetizer. She took our order and then when the crab cakes came we asked for some flatware, salt and pepper and maybe tobasco. We didn't think our request was out of line...you think right? Well finally when she buzzed by the area we reminded her and she said ""Oh I forgot."" At this point my Husband and I were really annoyed and no longer enjoying our time here. Views are nice is you've never been up the Tower...BUT you an get the views from not having to visit this place. We ended up just paying the tab and finding out about our table from the bar host who seemed to be running the show...well she told us it was another 30 minutes for the restaurant. We were fed up. We spoke with a manager who seemed to be playing manager for the day. She was a very young who really couldn't help us understand what was going on with their inadequate service and the long wait time when the place seemed quite empty. The drinks were average we ordered a ""special"" margarita they had, was not top shelf, tasted like a mix you get at the supermarket. The crab cakes were nuked and probably came already pre-made. We had visited the actual restaurant for dinner once before with a dinner party for the holidays and we could not remember anything terribly bad so that's why we went back for a visit. BIG MISTAKE. This place we won't be going back for. All the hype and nothing to back it up. Save your time and money.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"worst experience ever,i was in town to celebrate my birthday with my son,i made reservations 25 days in advance for 8:00 pm,we got to the rest about 7:30 and the hostess gave us a buzzer and showed us to the bar,at exactly 8:00 the buzzer went off and i thought this was going to be great,we went to the hostess and she told us to have a seat and someone would seat us,well after 15 minutes and after four other customers that came in after us were seated,i asked what was going on and she said she thought we were seated (although we were waiting directly in front of her).so the two of us were seated at a table for four and not the most desirable location (not what i expected making a reservation almost a month in advance),so Dave the waiter said he was going to make it better (Dave told me it was the end result that was important) so we ordered an appetizer and orderd the grand marnier souffle,next we ordered dinner we both had the 12oz filets mine rare my sons med well,and some sizzlin mushrooms to have with our steaks.the mushrooms came out before the steaks,both steaks came rare so my sons had to go back by the time it came back at was well done both our potatoes were cold and the mushrooms had long since lost there sizzle.so dessert time came and Dave brought us a menu ,my son said they forgot our dessert and i was saying no this is just for coffee,well he was right,no grand marnier souffle .",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I've resisted writing this review as I rarely, if ever, criticize a business publicly. However, my wife and I had previously celebrated our wedding anniversary annualy at the Chart House Restaurant for a number of years and found the food and service exceptional, which made our last visit there totally unacceptable by comparison. I made reservations several days earlier for ourselves and another couple, and looked forward to showing off our favorite place to them. We arrived just prior to our reservation time and were told our table wasn't ready and were sent to the bar upstairs. There, we exited the elevator and stood there for at least 10 minutes before anyone noticed us. It's difficult, due to dividing walls, to see which tables are available. An obviously overstretched server finally pointed in a general direction as she (nearly) ran by, saying ""I think there's some tables over there"".We started to hunt for one, but again, you have to go down several steps to be in a position to see each seating area, and finally our buzzer went off, and we walked downstairs to the restaurant without finding a table or a drink. We were seated, we were given menus and our drink orders were taken. We then saw no one for the next 20 minutes until our drinks arrived (including water). We ordered calamari as an appetizer. Now, if it's possible to love an appetizer, my wife and I loved the calamari on previous visits, lightly breaded, served piping hot, piled at least 8-10"" high on a round plate. Our ""calamari and friends"" came nearly stone cold, a pitiful pile maybe 4-5"" high on an small oval plate, rubbery and interspersed with related critters they quaintly refer to as ""friends"". Sorry, I don't want my calamari, or their offspring, staring back at me as I nibble on them. Our dinner orders were taken, and our waiter, who was being assisted by a trainee, disappeared for another 20-25 minutes, returning with our salads. The salads might have been good, but we'll never know as our entrees arrived approximately two minutes after our salads did, and as the tables aren't that large, we had to send our salads packing largely intact. I want to say that, on a good day, we have had some of the best steaks we've ever had in this restaurant. This, obviously, was not a good day. All I can say is that I have never been served a filet mignon that was rare at one end and medium well done at the other - I mean, a filet's not that long. Luckily, my attention to the steak was diverted by the delivery, after having had to ask the hostess to check on them, a dozen roses I had delivered earlier in the day for my wife for our anniversary. Luckily, they arrived before dessert and she loved them. Finally, we were able to enjoy the rest of our meal in peace, as we were't bothered further by waiters bringing refills (although someone did come to the table and sell us a $25.00 membership to the 'Select Club'). The damage for this wonderful food and service for four?  With tax, $296.26. As my wife and I always tip fairly generously, even when the service wasn't all that good, the grand total with the $60.00 tip was $356.26. Oh, we're celebrating this year at McDonald's, and taking a cruise with the savings.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Okay, I hate to start with such a whiny complaint, but the wait for the elevator is annoying (long wait to go up, really long wait to go down).
We had reservations, so were seated right away.  Our waitress was, let's just say, not polished.  She disappeared for long periods of time and we asked 3 other different people for help (such as to get more bread, get napkins, get the check...).
We were waiting a long time for our food when she came back and said that the salmon I ordered was not available (did I mention that the place wasn't even half full?).  So...I ordered something else and the really long wait began.  Our food was cold when it arrived--and mediocre.  The prices are atrocious.  It was such a disappointment.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"My husband and I dined here for our first wedding anniversary and since neither of us had been here before we thought this would be the perfect venue for a romantic dinner. A big irritant for me was the fact that they charge an additional $8.00 to park and it must be cash. Considering that we bought the pictures they took through our credit card you would think they could also charge parking to it. And to be honest since the entire menu is ridiculously expensive they could have just validated our parking. So our experience already started off on a bad foot because we had reservations that we did not want to miss so we parked near the park and walked to the resturaunt in the rain. Irritation number two is how long it takes for the elevator to come. I understand that this is also a tourist attraction but 15 minutes is an absurd amount of time to wait for an elevator. 


Now the food was good, not the best I've had in San Antonio and certainly did not warrant the price tag on most of the items but expected with the Landry's name. However for a certain price I expect service to be on point. Our service was similar to what you would find at a mom and pops resturaunt. We waited about 20 minutes for drinks, which ended up being the drinks we asked ot come with our meal. Another 20 minutes for the water we initially requested. My husband had to ask for straws 4 times and they did not come until about mid way through our meal. We had to pull our server to our table to tell her we were ready to order as we had sat for about 15 minutes waiting for her to come back to take our order. When we complained to our hostess nothing was done and she did not check back to make sure that thiings had gotten better. The last straw was having to wait another 20 minutes for the elevator and at that point half the resturaunt was waiting and had been waiting for at least 10 minutes. 


So while the view was remarkable and I love the concept of the roatating resturaunt we will not be making another visit any time soon.",Good,Good,Bad
"e went for the Stars and Stripes 4th of July celebration.
 The wait even with a reservation was extremely bad. People were getting sat without their pagers going off just due to sheer complaining. *waiting for an hour already* 
We waited assuming things would work out.


 Finally we made it upstairs to the actual restaurant. They walked us to the table that still had guests seated at it. They told us to stand right there and wait while they kicked these people off ""our"" table. After several nasty looks from the couple being removed, they said they would bus the table, they left ur standing there.... Right in the walk way in front of the kitchen entryway. I went back to the hostess station to be re-sat,  not left in the walk way to wait in the way of all people passing by. They again walked me right back to the same table. Oops same issue. So they moved us to the next table over, after we settled at that table with napkins in our laps the hostess came again and moved us to a completely different section. MIND YOU THAT IS THREE TABLE MOVES!! AND ALOT OF AWKWARD STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF DINERS. POOR PLANNING AND SERVICE.
The new section was just as bad. The server took 15 minutes to greet us, he gladly explained some excuse. With a thoughtful ""everything happens for a reason"" motto which he repeated several times throughout the meal. At this time it took another 15 minutes to bring back a sprite and a tea. And guess what?! Where we are located now every time someone walks by our whole little table shakes and moves. Yay! 
The appetizer was fondue, cold and reheated. Very blah! Long wait again, finally he states he will being the salad next, another 15 minutes. Salad was disgusting, seemed old nothing special. Another looooong wait with dirty dishes..... At this time out drinks have gone flat, no refills. Employee's have started to gather around us waiting for fireworks to begin. 
We sat there with no entrees, dirty dishes , crowded by unprofessional employees. Finally our mystery waiter arrives to take our old salad plates. Around ten minutes later COLD veggies, mashed brick like mashed potatoes & worthless hunk of flavorless beef arrives! 
At this point the fireworks begin! They were great, so pretty and close. Mind you the show doesn't have anything to do with TOA! We have beef on our plates but NO STEAK KNIFES! Our waiter returns with one knife stating that's all he could find.... Uuummm ok.
After a terrible meal, I couldn't waste anytime trying to leave. Managers ask every table around us how there meal was, but yet not us, our waiter ignored us. I JUST WANTED MY CHECK! 
JOY!  
The waiter returns to make our night worse with cheesecake. FINALLY A NICE MANAGER CAME TO THE TABLE, I explained what happened in greater detail, explaining I had been there before and how disappointed we were. She did take one of the meals of the tab. Ok so not a total loss, then time for the check. But wait still no check, the waiter completely blew us off after talking with the manager. I wasn't about to wait another 15 minutes for a check with all empty tables around us... 


We walked to the front hostess stand to ask for our check, that poor girl had to hunt down our waiter. He begrudgingly brought the check to me up front. I let my husband sign the credit card receipt, while I was in the restroom. ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT MR. WAITER MADE $ 27 GRATUITY OFF OUR MEAL. REALLY BUDDY, SERIOUSLY! 


A WARNING TO ALL, THE FOOD WAS JUST TERRIBLE, THE WAIT WITH RESERVATION WAS UNSPEAKABLE, THE WAITER SHOULD BE TERMINATED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, A HUGE HUGE LET DOWN. AND IT COST ME SERIOUS $$$$",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I was so excited to bring my husband here for our Anniversary and wow was I so disappointed. I was frustrated through the entire meal and when we left. We got there early to request a window seat and to sit at the bar. So packed and hot, took forever to get a drink and couldn't even order appetizers. We went to the restaurant and waited way past our reservation and it seemed that they had forgot about us and first tried the window but they had already sat another couple and so they gave us a large table on te second deck. It wasn't busy at all and there were many open tables. It was 730 and it was so hot that we were sweating. I understand that the sun is setting and we are high up but holy smokes it was crazy hot. Took forever to get water and it took over an hour to get our very expensive gross food. I hated paying $30 for overcooked fish with no flavor. It took another hour to get our check and then we had to wait 20 min for the elevator. Our waiter was not professional and it was frustrating. The view is pretty at night, I would advise only going to the bar if you want to be high up. I am really not one to bash places, but I was so frustrated that our experience was bad on our anniversary. Go to a nice restaurant downtown and get great quality food for the same price. It was so not worth it.",Bad,Good,Bad
"Nice views, but you can get that from the observation deck. Maybe have a drink at the bar, but not worth the money.  Dined there over Memorial Day with my wife and our son who is temporarily stationed there.  The location is stunning although for some the rotation could cause a bit of an odd feeling. We arrived for an 8pm reservation and was seated around 830pm. No cause for concern as it was Memorial Day weekend.  Wait staff in the bar area were very friendly as were the bartenders. Hostess seems to need a little people person work as she seem cold. We were seated at an inner table but the views were still very good.  That is where the good stopped.


Our waiter, showed up about 5 minutes later, and asked if we wanted drinks and dinner rolls. The rolls showed up yet no dishware to place them on and the drinks followed in reasonably short order.  Eventually my wife made a remark about the lack of the plates and he ended up grabbing some from another table. I did not order an app as nothing appealed to me, instead I ordered a caesar salad. Lettuce was wilted to almost cooked spinach and the dressing was pretty much tasteless. I can not be 100% sure but I suspect the salad made me ill that night and the following day. My wife and son split the crab/shrimp fondue that was OK.  In hind sight that probably was too much bread in one sitting but they did not complain and ate most of it.


Ordered the main course, they got steak I got a Snapper dish that was supposedly fresh. It was not and I doubt it was Snapper as I have had that in Florida numerous times. This looked more like mahi or similar. The rice was cold.  Mentioned it to our waiter but not much response came from the passing complaint.  My son ordered his steak medium and it showed up well done. He did send it back and got one that was cooked to his liking in a fairly quick time frame. My wife had a steak that was just a tad over done but not too bad.  


Desert - we ordered two of the Chocolate Lava cake - on for there and another for my son to-go. These no matter where we have had them are great.


All in all not a bad meal just nothing memorable other than the view.  We have been to other Chart Houses (Savannah, Cardiff, Boston) where it has been more than excellent and very memorable.  This fell short, Landry group needs to take a look at this one.   Just because the view is good you not expect people to pay $70/$80 per person and put marginally good product out there. would not eat there again was the consensus.",Bad,Good,
Breath taking views with average and overpriced food. Plan to be there early even with reservations. Finding parking and the elevator ride to the restaurant can take some time. Get there early and enjoy the view from the bar or the observation deck while you wait. Friendly staff but loud atmosphere. Don't forget to try the Lava Cake. Overall a good place to eat with the most beautiful view of the Alamo City,,Good,Good
"I take my sons to the restaurant at the Tower of the Americas once a year, every year, to celebrate their advancement from one grade to the next... and while the restaurant name changes, now and then, it seems the food quality and the prices never improve. Two children's meals, one adult meal (fish) and one unremarkable $8 glass of wine, and we left more than $75 there!?! Yikes. One child's meal (prime rib) was $12.99, the other child's meal (two shrimp and two chicken strips) was $8.99, and my adult entree ($30.99) was so greasy and smelled so fishy, I took half of it home in a to-go box and ended up throwing it away. We dodged the repeated pitches for their $10+ desserts. Our server was very attentive and very gracious in interacting with the children, but other than that and the always-impressive view of San Antonio, this meal was embarrassingly overpriced, for what it was. (How do you spell ""tourist trap""?)",Bad,Good,Good
Can't beat the view from this revolving restaurant at the top of the Towers of America.  Food is good (not great).  Prices are WAY overpriced.  They don't have a lunch menu so be prepared to pay dinner prices at lunch.  $30 for a plate of shrimp at lunch.  Not again.  Rather just pay for the exhibition deck view and go back down and find a restaurant on the riverwalk.  By the way service is slow as can be.  For the prices they charge they should be feeding you as well as serving.,,Good,Bad
"When you arrive at the Tower of Americas, be prepared to wait in line for the elevator to the restaurant. Even though we made a reservation for 9 pm, we were not seated until 9:30. There were plenty of open tables. We did get a seat next to the window which was very nice. Great views as advertised and expected. The food however is average. The service does not pace the meal very well, a salad was not served until the main course came out. It's worth a first time experience but I would not return for another visit.",,Good,Bad
"Upon arriving on a Monday at noon with a reservation, we asked for a window table since we were told they could not be reserved.  The restaurant was almost empty but we were told we could only have a booth overlooking the windows.  I asked if a window table was available again and was told that we could have a booth.  So...we overlooked a young couple on a date our entire meal.  Our waiter was nice, but talked SO fast I had a hard time understanding most of what he said.  I tried ordering a spicy bloody mary and he kept saying I had to have the $10 one on the menu.  I told him I just wanted the basic one and FINALLY he said ok.  Our entrees were good and timely but definitely did not match the price paid.  We pre-ordered our dessert but it still took well over 30 minutes to have it delivered.  In the meantime, my half drank bloody mary was taken from the table and the waiter was MIA until dessert arrived.  At that point, we were all tired, cranky and thirsty.  I just felt for a $100 lunch, service should have been more spot on and I still wish we had gotten a window seat since the majority of them were empty the entire time we were there.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Our one night stay in San Anonio lead to much disappointment in choosing this ""romantic""  restaurant for the one meal we would eat out., considering  the multitude of great choices available. We were  mislead by the ad stating that the bar as well as the dining room had a rotating view of the city, and because half of the items on the Happy Hour menu were not even available my husbands only choice for an entree was fish tacos which were just okay. I ordered off the dinner menu and got cold - dry chunks of tasteless  chicken on my $12.00 chicken caesar salad. To add to our poor dining experience our waitress was crabby and a snob.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"On a visit to San Antonio we decided to head to 610 (the Chart House bar) at the tower for happy hour, followed by watching the sunset, followed by dinner. When we sat down at 610, a waiter eventually came to the table. They were out of the happy hour Cabernet I ordered so I went with something else. We tried to order the mussels on the happy hour menu. ""Sorry, we are out of those."" We opted for the tuna nachos. A few minutes later ""Sorry, we are out of those."" We got our drinks after a long wait, and food (we ordered fish tacos and prime rib sliders) came out about 45 minutes later after we asked if it was coming. The food was good, but could have been warmer. We finished, paid, went upstairs to watch a spectacular sunset, and instead of risking further disappointment at Chart House, walked back to the River Walk for a great barbeque dinner at County Line.",Bad,Good,Bad
Way too expensive for the quality of the food.  Seriously.,Bad,,
"The only positive point was the view. This is it. Dry fish, burnt steak, untastey food, slow service and such a cold airconditioning that we had to eat with our winter jackets on!",Bad,,
The place was romantic but the food was expensive. It is not a lot of food. You pay more for the location on the Tower of America. Nice and cozy.,Bad,Good,
"I knew that this was a ‚Äòtourist trap‚Äô, but I figured that since I am a tourist at least I could enjoy the view. I had no idea how bad this place could be.  The food was overpriced and was generally mediocre, both of which were expected.  However, the potential enjoyment of the view and the overall ‚Äòambiance‚Äô, which I was counting on, was pretty much destroyed by the following.
1.   The restaurant was fairly dark, as was normal.  The problem was that the area where the food was prepared was lit up intensely.  When the door was left open to this area, which it frequently was for long periods, the contrast between this intense light and the darkness of the restaurant was jarring, and made it difficult to appreciate the view.
2.  The wait staff seemed completely untrained.  For example, among the various irritating habits of my waiter was the fact that he continually asked me if I wanted anything else (note per the above that I spent about $55 for my meal, so I was not trying to get off cheap).  He did this 11 times, about once every 4 minutes.  This made it impossible to relax, perhaps indulge in a reverie or two, and enjoy the view.
Save your money and avoid a lot of irritation and have a drink at the bar on the next level.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Very busy night and they seem to have taken a lot of walk ins which let to a back up. Waited almost an hour for our anniversary reservation that we made 3 weeks in advance. They kept coming back and asking for my name. Not at all efficient.,,Bad,Bad
"President Bush said"" Screw me once shame on you, screw me twice shame on you again. They blew it and lied about the circumstances. The restaurant ruined my 29th wedding anniversary by first bringing me raw lobster, and topped the transgression by bringing me a cheaper lower quality replacement.. I never write reviews because the irritation passes. This is still a burr in my but still today. They are overpriced and the view can't compensate from crappy staff and a belief that you owe them. Two consecutive anniversary‚Äôs down the tube. They ate the $200 ticket and I‚Äôm still pissed. They lied and stuck to it. Thank GOD it wasn‚Äôt the 30th. Once you have a truly Bad there are tooooo many quality restaurants in San Antonio to settle for a great view and substandard service. Tillman Fetitta should be ashamed.",Bad,Good,Bad
Main course was overcooked. Restaurant seem run and managed by teenagers. Wrong orders delivered at the table. Can't send anyone to this place. After a Bad waiter want to sell us on landrys club. Incredible.,Bad,Bad,Bad
...and then go through a drive through fast food restaurant.  The view will be better and so will the food.  The net result is you will come out spending the same amount of money but the result will be a lot better than eating at this tourist trap.  I sent my food back twice. It was wrong the first time and cold the second time. My wife was disappointed in her meal as well as our out of town guests.  A very big mistake. I was embarrassed by this experience.,Bad,Bad,
"So first, it costs $8 to park....wow, really?


We go here, dressed up for a nice romantic dinner.  We were seated at a lovely table for 2 right next to the windows, however, it was so cold in the restaurant, the windows were filled with condensation and the only way to get a view was to stand up which wouldn't have been appropriate.  It was so cold, that the table clothes were blowing.  I addressed this with the waiter and the manager and nothing changed.  If you go, just bring a cardigan.  You will still be cold, but hopefully a little more comfortable.


We were greeted about 5 minutes after we sat by ""Melvin"" our waiter.  There was a table next to us who sat at the same time with four people there. (this will be significant later)


Melvin made some suggestions for appetizers but we decided to go our own route and order the Lobster and Shrimp Spring Rolls which we were really looking forward to and the Lobster Mac and Cheese.  We also ordered a bowl of the ""award winning"" New England Clam chowder which won best of Boston 3 years in a row.   We were told about 10 minutes after ordering that they were out of spring rolls....wow, really?  We substituted for the calamari.  All three items came at once and there wasn't enough room at our table for all the food and our appetizer plates.  The neighbors got their soup way before us and were already finished theirs.  Our soup was not award winning, not even all that great.  It was extremely salty and not substantive.  The calamari was cold which we complained about and did not accept a new order because we didn't want to ruin our dinner which should have been coming out soon.  It took so long to get our appetizers.  Our lobster mac and cheese had one average size piece of lobster claw in there with maybe some other shreds of it...there was not a lot of cheese.  Just noodles hanging out in the plate.  The truffle oil on it was good, it was a little salty.  Again, not substantive enough.  When the runner brought our appetizers we asked for a bread basket, only available on request.....really?  $50 per person and you have to ask for a bread basket.  He said ok, but never brought it.  We were finished our apps with empty water glasses, never refilled.  Our waiter came back and said dinner would be out in about 5 min but it took at least 15, we also requested a bread basket from him which he said ok to, but didn't bring it until he brought our dinner out.  We told him to take it back.  My boyfriend got the spiced ahi tuna which was cooked Medium and he liked it.  It was on top of the mashed potatoes which were tasty, but not that hot.  The serving size was significant.  I got the macadamia crusted mahi mahi.  The serving size WAS NOT WORTH the $31-32 it cost.  I get bigger pieces at the grocery store for $4.  The sauce that it was placed on was good, but my food was not hot.  It came with under done green beans.  We passed on dessert.  Our bill was $105.  The calamari cost $14 but they took $13 off for it claiming it under the ""referral program"", we told our waiter and he did take off the other $1, but personally this meal wasn't worth more than $50.


Don't go here for dinner....you will be disappointed.  Especially for the price.  The experience is for the view so maybe go to the lounge grab an app and go somewhere else for dinner, if it's worth $8 for you to park.....I would not recommend anyone to eat here.",Bad,Good,Bad
"Our order was completely mishandled.  My husband & I ordered a $130 meal.  I received the wrong entree and a salad that was supposed to ""light"" on the dressing was drenched.  My husband did not receive his side dish until 40 minutes after he was done eating, and after he was told the item was no longer available.  Our beverages were completely empty throughout the meal for at least 30 minutes afterward, until we asked for a manager.  The manager ( who kept us waiting 20 minutes!) deducted $16 for the ruined meal.  We quietly complained AGAIN, and this time the kitchen manager kindly offered to step in, but again kept us waiting another 30 minutes and still would not return to our table but instructed our waitress to ""drop the check"" and refused to provide a deduction comensarate with the charges.  This is what you can expect.  The service is so outrageously bad it overshadows the Good and ruins the experience.",Good,Bad,Bad
"We love Chart House restaurants especially the great fresh fish and salad bar.  This Chart House is at the top of the Tower of America in Hemispark near San Antonio Riverwalk. Great location and outstanding view 650' above the city, especially at sunset.  Food selection was good but we found food was average including service.  We were specific with waitress on how we wanted our fish cooked but it came almost raw, not to our taste. By the time it was sent back and received my partner had already finished his meal.  Manager was very generous and understanding but it should not have happened. The lack of the salad bar was a disappointment since Chart House is famous for this feature.  We would try again and do recommend dining there and enjoying the meal.",Bad,Good,
"We were very excited to go to this resturant for dinner. 750ft up it has a great view and we had a beutiful sunset. 


Dinner was very unacceptable. For the price of fine dining, you get Red Lobster or worse quality. The swordfish was cold and tough, very small portion, The stuffed flounder was worse, tasting as if it had been under a heat lamp at low voltage for a while. We sent both back and did not receive much better the second try. The upcharge of 299 for a baked potato ended up being a 699 charge for a cold undercooked potato. Again it was sent back with the replacement being just as bad. 


The steak and turf was advertised as prime rib, ending up more like roast beef. 


The only good entree was the plank salmon. It was delivered correctly


Service was poor and unattentive. You do not go to a resturant like this to be hurried, but you do not expect to be neglected. We ordered a second bottle of wine only to have another waiter clearing our table and taking the glasses. When we finally got the bottle and once again requested glasses, they brought white wine glasses instead of the correct red glasses. Poorly trained staff. 


If you chose to go here, go for drinks at the 601 bar and maybe appetizers, but do not bother with the overpriced ,poorly delivered entrees.",Bad,Good,Bad
"My husband and I ate here several years ago, decided to give it a second chance.  We are in San Antonio for vacation.  We were both terribly disappointed!  The drinks and salad were very good, service not so much and the food was inedible!  Husband had steak ""medallions"" ordered them medium, they were nothing more than a thinly sliced well done piece of beef jerky tasting substance.  I had the mahi with lump crab served on risotto, was only able to eat about 4 bites! The risotto tasted worse than an instant boxed the mahi was plain with no taste, needless to say I sent my plate back. The manager did appear at our table minutes later to apologize and offered to remove my dish from the bill ( We quickly declined his offer) we had no desire to not pay for the meal.  The bill was 165.00 for the worst meal I've ever experienced.  Will certainly not eat here again nor recommend it to anyone else! So many wonderful restaurants down on the river walk......don't waste your time and money on this place.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Food portions small, Horrible wait staff, incompetent bartender, stuffy enclosure, I would avoid this place at all cost, speaking of cost, They stuck me for $150. I will not be going back there again. It was a total ripoff.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Started with the stuffed mushrooms which were delicious. I ordered the seared mahi mahi & you could tell  it was going to be bland just from looking at it.  It was supposed to come covered with lobster & crab but it included exactly 5 pieces of crab & the saffron risotto was overcooked to near mush. Had the waiter  bring me lemon butter to give my fish flavor but even that was only tolerable. My husband ordered the macadamia crusted mahi which was flavorful mainly because of the mango salsa & peanut sauce.  The manager stopped by after I told the waiter of my concerns & she asked if we  ordered a dessert, we had ordered the molten lava cake which she offered to take off the check & assured us would be worth it but she was wrong. My favorite part of the nonexistent ""lava"" were the heath bar chunks atop the cake. it was not worth the $10 discount in compensation of my $30 meal. I would recommend the bar & appetizers, but save your money on dinner.",Bad,,Good
"The view was spectacular and the atmosphere was good. Here ends the positive points. The food was marginal at best. Worst of all was the service. Our waiter was one of the worst ever. He was rude, slow and tried to be intimidating. By far the worst dining experience in San Antonio. There are way too many other great restaurants in this fabulous city. Save yourself some money, time and trouble and eat on the Riverwalk.",Bad,Good,Bad
"After eating a large lunch earlier in the day, we decided to have dessert and cocktails at Chart House.  When the waiter realized we weren't having dinner he was very rude.  We planned to mention it to the manager, but he showed up to rush us out.  We had been there a total of 35 minutes!  Our bill was over $50 and we were not allowed to relax and enjoy our drinks without feeling like we were being rushed out the door.  No water refills without asking and to top it off the waiter gave us the ""hard sell"" on a $100 discount card that we repeatedly told him we weren't interested in!!  We were given the impression that we weren't wanted bc we weren't buying a full meal.  I wish we had gone to the observation tower and gotten dessert elsewhere.",,Bad,Bad
"Despite the amazing view from the tower, our group of friends was quite unimpressed with the bar area at the Chart House restaurant. The server was impolite and failed to wipe the table off from the previous guests. The temperature was uncomfortably warm and the seats were very low compaired to the height of the tabletop. The seating was also dirty and worn.",,Bad,Bad
"The food was terrible. The waitress acted like she was doing us a favor and not the other way around. Do yourself a favor. Take the trip up, look around, and go to dinner or drinks somewhere else.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"My husband and I had a belated anniversary dinner. Menu was difficult to see in the dark. Good thing the waiter had an LED penlight. Music was a tad too loud. Special lettuce wedge with blue cheese dressing. Asked for extra, was told they had run out. Steak on the dry side. Shrimp Fresca-pasta cold. Mushrooms-good, Spinach-good.  
I have written negative reviews on Open Table, and The Chart House website, and have yet to be contacted by either one. Total bill including tip $180.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This is one of those experiences that you do just for the experience.  It was fun to be up above SA spinning around, watching the view change every few minutes.  Because of that, we were willing to overlook the overpriced so-so food and drinks.  Our service was lackluster, but perhaps that depends on who you get as a waiter, as another table near us had a great waiter who pointed out sites below as they passed by.  Our waiter was silent, and seemed to get a bit lost getting things to us in a timely manner.  Food was nothing special - typical chart house chain seafood.  But, the view and the fun of spinning around made us more tolerant than we might have been in a different setting.",,Good,Bad
"The view is great, but for about $10 you can buy a ticket to the ride the elevator to the top of the tower instead of $180 for dinner for three.  The seafood fondue appetizer is just a plate of melted cheese and shrimp with and toast on the side.  Not fondue sticks, no dipping, not very interesting.  My $30 sea bass arrived cold.  My mother‚Äôs prime rib ($27) was very rare, not medium rare and very fatty.  My husband‚Äôs scallops were cold and not very interesting.  The waiter was either overwhelmed with his duties or taking a break.  When food arrives cold it is usually the wait staff, but the small piece of fish and fatty steak is the kitchen.   Anyway, it was not worth the money and I would not go back or recommend the restaurant.",Bad,Good,Bad
"We visited for lunch,  Thursday, Nov. 4th. The food is good, but not anything to write home about, and by ordinary standards, overpriced.  But this is not an ordinary restaurant.  The view is wonderful, and the period of rotation of the revolving restaurant is about 75 minutes.  Soooo,  definitely worth a visit, so don't complain about the pricing or the chef's mediocre efforts.  Other restaurants may be better but they don't offer the same experience.
  However, they could improve the wine selection. In fact I could write a better wine list myself.  The wines are exclusively from California, and are of dubious quality, in my not very humble opinion.",Good,Good,Bad
"My better half and I decided to celebrate our first anniversary at the top of the San Antonio to signify our out of this world relationship.  Unfortunately, after we arrived and seated we were quickly brought down to earth by this restaurant.  Our server was very friendly and attentive, but the food was less than to be desired!  


We both ordered shrimp cocktail as an appetizer.  No cocktail sauce, but something that was more like a bloody mary mix with no kick to it.  It was very apparent by the taste and smell that the shrimp was old.  I only ate 1 of my 5 shrimp.  AND half way through our appetizer, an expediter brings out our salads!  My partner hadn't even finished 2 of his shrimp. I told them to bring them back after our appetizer was done.  Not what I would expect from a fine dining restaurant.


When we finally were ready for our salad, they brought a huge salad!  I would hardly consider this a side salad.  It tasted good but looked very odd as everything in the salad looked like it had been put through a food processor...very small diced. It was OK, but too much. I didn't finish mine as I was waiting for my prime rib.


We also both had prime rib which was totally, totally disappointing.  It was only about 1/4-1/2 inch thick and 1/3 of it was all fat.  I just couldn't believe that the chef would consider these pieces of rib appropriate to serve.  After I removed the fat, I did enjoy the prime rib but it was just unsettling to have this much fat on my plate.


I did speak with the manager on duty and showed her exactly what I was talking about with the amount of fat. She just stood there and said OK with a very indifferent attitude.  No apology or offer to talk to the kitchen about it.  I honestly think she didn't know how to handle someone with a complaint. Not what I would expect from the manager.


Although, the atmosphere and ambiance was fabulous, it just doesn't make up for really Bad.  If I decide to return, I won't waste my money on dinner.  I'd try the lounge upstairs for drinks and appetizers (if I can find one that I like).",Bad,Good,
"This restaurant is located in the Tower of the Americas, so the view is spectacular.  The restaurant is clean and we were seated on time for our reservation, but that's where the compliments end.  The fried calamari appetizer was pretty flavorless, and the dipping sauce was sloshed all over the plate. I order snapper, but I was served a thin, greasy filet, which I think was catfish. The ""snapper"" was supposed to be served with rice pilaf, but I've seen similar concoctions from the microwavable bag of Uncle Ben's rice.  My husband ordered a New York Strip, but was served a thin, fatty, dry slice of beef, which resembled more of a sirloin or skirt steak, than a $30 cut of beef.  Again, the dipping sauch was sloshed out of the dish and all over the plate.  Side salads are not an option, so we ordered a dinner salad to split, which never came.   I watched a woman at the table next to me send her steak back twice.  We were so disappointed by the end of the entree that we skipped dessert.  I ate so little of my food that I had a snack once we got home.  I live in San Antonio, and I'm embarrassed that so many tourists choose this restaurant for a special night out in my city, and are served such poor quality food.  Definitely go to the observatory to see the view from the Tower, but you can find much better food in San Antonio than at the Chart House.",Bad,Good,
"Our party of approximately 60 people ate in a private dining room at the Chart House in early July 2010. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The service was painfully slow and the food was just awful.  My dining companions and I had eaten lightly all day in anticipation of a delicious dinner. We nearly starved waiting for the appetizer (standard green salads) and had to beg the waiter to for an additional tiny basket of rolls. When our entrees finally appeared, we were served cold greyish colored, fat-riddled steaks and gelatinous mashed potatoes.  We had asked for side of vegtable and were given a  plate of sauted brocalli and red peppers that was so small (and I'm not making this up) seven of us each had one brocalli floret with nothing for the eighth.  When we had the audacity to ask for more vegtables, our waiter looked aghast! What a greedy bunch we were!  I guess we just depleted the restaurant's vegtable reserve. After another long wait, (plenty of time to digest our cold fatty steaks) our dessert arrived. Since they had run out of cheese cake, most of us selected the tantilizingly named ""Death by Chocolate"".  Death would only occur choking on the dry crumbs of this week-old Sara Lee cake. Of course we all needed coffee to try and swallow our dessert but unfortunately the entire party was only provided with three cups. Hmmm, perhaps we were expected to line up and take turns chugging from the coffee urn. To top of this laughably awful dining experience, our tab came to just over $71.00 each.  If you want to see the breathtaking view at the Tower of the Americans, go on the observation deck. There are plenty of great restaurants in San Antonio. Avoid the Chart House like the plague!",Bad,Bad,Bad
Best view around.,,Good,
"The lobster bisque, while very good, wasn't hot.  Nor was the after-dinner coffee - we sent it back. It was chilly in the restaurant and I had to wear my sweater but I would think that this was something that the kitchen could compensate for.
Despite the fact that I was assured the ahi was only flown in that day, I ate a piece that had me ill before we even left the restaurant. (At least my system rejected it quickly!) My husband's salad and salmon were good, though.  Service was only fair.
We had walked to the restaurant so I wanted to wait until my system had settled down before heading back.  The restaurant provided me a glass of water and comped the bad ahi only.  
Very disappointed in the overall experience.  If it weren't for the view I would give it a much lower rating.  Best advice?  Just go to the observation deck and skip the pricey, poor food.",Bad,Bad,
"We had lunch here and were pleasantly surprised to find such an upscale atmosphere in a revolving tower setting.  The service was ridiculously formal for how unprofessional it was - it seemed like it was the waiter's first time in a restaurant!  The lunch menu is terrible - it is a reduced version of the dinner menu with slightly lower prices, and there are no ""lunch"" items like sandwiches (there was a french dip, but they were out of this when we tried to order it even though there were only about 10 other people in the restaurant), light salads (there were a few but they were very heavy sounding), etc.  We ended up ordering the coconut shrimp (fried shrimp with coconut basting) and shrimp fresca (pasta with shrimp and crab). The shrimp were okay, but the pasta was the most disgusting pasta we've ever encountered with a plop of crab meat on top and at least a stick of butter in the sauce - it was completely inedible.


It was very pleasant to sit by the window for an hour in the air conditioning  and watch the changing view, so I would consider going here for drinks and maybe an appetizer.",Bad,Good,Bad
"We selected the Chart House for our anniversary dinner. The ride up in the external elevator was a bit disturbing. We both had to turn away after getting about halfway up, but once we reached the top, we quickly adjusted - the view was spectacular! A word of warning: we have eaten in several moving restaurants in our day. Chart House revolves at a speed that is faster than any of the others. We were not bothered, but some diners could not tolerate it and had to leave.


We were greeted promptly by our servers and congratulated on the special occasion.  We went with the appetizer suggested by the server, the shrimp and crab fondue. It was absolutely delicious! My husband wasn't very hungry, so he ordered the Chart House chopped salad and clam chowder. The chopped salad was mushy and lacked flavor. The clam chowder was very ordinary. The server tried to persuade me to order the special of the night but I decided to pass on it because it had a cream cheese based stuffing and the fondue had already hit those notes. Perhaps I should have listened because I ordered the Pan Seared Sea Scallops and lived to regret it. The scallops did not have a good sear on them and amazingly, they were tasteless. How do you make scallops lose their flavor? The soy-ginger broth was basically nothing but soy sauce. It was SO salty that I could not eat the entree. The coconut rice may have had an interesting flavor, but if it did, it was lost in the soy brine in which it rested. After one scallop and a fork full of rice, I could not make myself continue.


To their credit, they were very concerned that I did not like the meal. My server offered to bring something else. By that time, I had lost my appetite and politely declined. I told them not to worry about it, but they insisted on removing the charge from our bil and the manager came over to apologizel. Really, you couldn't ask for more.


They brought us a special chocolate dessert at no charge in honor of our anniversary and it was rich and delicious. 


Overall, we were disappointed with the food. It's possible that we just made the wrong choices but at those prices I don't want to experience hit-or-miss. However, the view is not to be missed. Make a late reservation for dessert and go to see the city from the best view in town.",Bad,Good,Good
Loved the idea of a revolving restaurant and the views were splendid.  Unfortunately the food was only average and the service was very poor.,Bad,Good,Bad
"i grew up in san antonio and remember when the tower was finished for the world's fair in 1968.  the restaurant back then and up until the ""chart house"" took over was somewhat pricey, but you got what you paid for - Good, great ambiance and fantastic service.   the last time we visited the tower of the americas (after the chart house was opened), we spent over $100 (w/o the tip) on our dinner with food that i'd be embarrassed to serve at a potluck dinner.  it was the worst.  i've eaten much much better food at dennys.  our entrees were less than steller and the side dishes tasted like they'd been taken from a deep freeze and dumped into boiling water for a few minutes, then slathered on the plate.  i am not trying to be rude or ugly, but for a $100 meal, you'd think there was some redeeming quality to our dinner - there wasn't.  even the coffee was lukewarm.


 the wait staff was young and not big on customer service, typical of most eateries today.  my recommendation - definitely ride the elevators to the top, check out the view, but save your hunger (and $$$$) for any one of the delicious restaurants san antonio is famous for; the many on the river walk, up san pedro, down broadway, etc.  if you want to experience the revolving restaurant (and i must admit, a most beautiful view at dusk, when the sun has just set and the lights of the city are turning on), buy a drink and the least expensive item on the menu.",Bad,Good,Bad
"I live here in town, and we thought we would take our daughter to the tower for a fancy dinner out.  The tower, as expected, has great views, and that is the only nice thing I can say.  This is easily one of the most expensive restaurants in San Antonio, with the least return on your investment.  Our waiter was worse than the average Olive Garden server.  He got the drinks wrong, didn't apologize, offered to fix them, and then somehow forgot.  The meals were average at best, overcooked steak and frozen salmon.  The fancy chocolate desert was surprisingly similar to Chili's molten chocolate cake.  


I would recommend the tower to tourists, but not the restaurant.  We have many fine dining establishments downtown at which you can have a better dining experience, and more than save the money for the elevator ride to the observation or bar level.  The bar has to be better, although the restaurant couldn't get our drinks right!",Bad,Good,Bad
"There was a group of 11 of us.  We had a 7:30 reservation.  Got our table right away.  Two hours later 8 of us had food, 1 got her salad, 1 got her mushrooms for her steak but no steak and 1 got nothing,  nada.  When we first talked to the manager there was going to be no meals comped.  They wanted the mushrooms and salad paid for even though that was the only  thing they received from their order.  After 3 hours of hell, we were all comped  the 17 percent gratuity and the ladies who did not receive their entire meals were comped.  Save  your money and your sanity and go somewhere else.  The view is nice. Go up and take a gander but don't eat there.  The food is below average and the service is worse.  Tilman Fertitta should definitely do something about this nice location but terrible restaurant.",Bad,Good,Bad
This CAN'T be the correct location...,,,
"We visited TOA last week. While we loved the view and the whole rotating restaurant experience we did not love the food at the Chart House or their prices.  Honestly, the food was no better then any Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday's. Soggy, tough crab wontons, packaged rice pilaf (described as ginger rice on the menu),and plates so hot from being under the warmer for too long that we couldn't even touch them for most of the meal. Our food had a crust over everything, it was disgusting.We were very dissapointed in the meal and did not chance wasting more money on dessert. Also, everything is ala carte, so if you want a baked potato or mashed with your steak it will cost you an additonal $7-9.  If I had to do it again I would go to the observation deck and then have dinner at one of the restaurants downtown, much better food and better prices.",Bad,Good,
"Food, view and waiters were outstanding! Some of the best food we had in San Antonio all week. Worth the price! Now the bad part - We had reservations and showed up 30 minutes early. We ended up waiting 45 minutes, while dozens of tables remained empty that whole time and then we still didn't get a window seat. Hostesses were rude, unhelpful and showed utter disregard for the well-being and overall experience of its patrons. Even with four of them manning the front podium, they had no idea how to do their job or how to please their customers. The hostesses are definitely losing a lot of business for the restaurant. Recommend coming for drinks at the bar before hand, to lessen the blow of the ineptitude of the hostess staff prior to being ""eventually"" seated.",Good,Bad,Bad
"My experience was the same as the others:
-waiting in the bar area, only to realize there are no waitresses to take your drink order.  Must go to bar and listen to bartender feel sorry for himself
-waiting forever for a table, only to get into the restaurant and find it near empty.
-I had the fillet and shrimp ($30).  It was luke-warm and tasteless.
-The food took forever (over an hour on a slow night).


Given what I saw, all of these things are indicative of some serious management issues.  


Stay away from this place.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I attempted to make a reservation online, only to find that they had availability at 5 or 8 pm; nothing in between.  This would not work with the conference schedule we had to keep.  We decided to go to the tower anyway to check out the view at about 6 p.m..  Once there, we asked about availability & wow, they could seat us in 45 minutes to an hour.  We wondered about the online reservation system.


We went to the observation deck.  View of the city was extraordinary.  We then headed to the bar.  Awful, awful, awful.  We waited and waited for someone to take our drink order.  We considered appetizers, but would they ever come to our table?  No, they did not.  We went to the bar and ordered 2 drinks.  Bartender was having problems, although the restaurant did not seem busy.  Margarita came straight out of a mix.  No strawberry puree as listed on the menu.


Finally our pager went off.  We wandered to the upstairs hostess station & were seated next to the window.  It was relaxing to revolve around the city and again, the view was impressive.  We watched the sunset and dirty dishes at the table next to us.  No bus staff to be seen.


The restaurant was not full.  Why the 1 hour wait?  Our conversation turned to problemsolving the issues of the restaurant.


Waiter was attentive but after 30 minutes he apologized and said that he would be bringing out bread as soon as some was ready.  Eventually it showed up.


Filet mignon was good.  Sizzling Mushrooms were excellent.  Mashed potatoes were awful.  I don't think anyone tasted the potatoes prior to serving.  We decided we were patron's in an episode of Ramsey's kitchen show and called it a night.",Good,Bad,Bad
"If you are visiting San Antonio TX please stay away from this restaurant.  Hopefully, my experience was unusual but I get the feeling it wasn't.


First of all, we arrived at about noon thinking it would be a good place to have lunch.  We were told that it would be a one and a half hour wait.  Since we didn't have reservations we figured oh why not.


We were told that we could do the tour of the Tower while we waited ($10.00) or just sit in the bar area.  Since the bar was on the top floor we choose the bar.  Smart huh?  Not really.


We found a cozy table and enjoyed a beautiful view.  We looked over the menu and found great looking drinks.  We waited for someone to take our order.  While waiting, we enjoyed looking out over the city, it was a great view.  We could also see the tables in the restaurant beneath us as they revolved.  


I was shocked to see that the place was practically empty.  At one point, I was able to count 13 empty tables in a row. wow.  It was lunch time for Pete's sake.  Why was the place empty?


It's been about 20 minutes and no one has taken our drink order.  Mind you, the bar was relatively empty as well.  We went up to the bartender who immediately took our drink order and then went into great detail about how busy he was.


His entire diatribe took about 10 minutes.  Another couple saw us go up to get drinks and they did the same.  The bartender was friendly enough to spend another 10minutes with them explaining how busy he was.


Well, after average drinks, we had about a half hour left on our wait.  We were finally called and it was exactly one and a half hours later.  Perfect.


We were seated in a great little window seat and were able to see the entire city.  It was purty.  About ten minutes after sitting down, we were given water.  Thank God we had our water bottles with us.  About 10 minutes later, the waiter took our order.  


We started with a Caesar salad and a lobster bisque soup.  At this time, we asked for some bread to enjoy with our water.  No such luck.  After about 20 minutes, the waiter arrived with the soup and salad.  The salad looked, well old.  It tasted even older.
The soup was very good but now it was cold as we were still waiting for bread.  My friend decided to eat her soup without bread.  She reminded the waiter about the bread and he brought it out just in time to remove her empty soup bowl and to take away my full plate of salad. sigh....


He asked what was wrong with the salad.  I told him it was soggy and tasted old.  He asked if I'd like to speak with the manager.  I just said ""no.""  It wasn‚Äôt worth it at this point.


After about 15 minutes, the entrees arrived.  They make such a big huge deal about having two waiters raise your food high in the air before placing it in front of you. Not a smart thing to do since the food is practically cold when you get it anyway.


I had a steak and the grilled shrimp.  I had to peel the shrimp off the skewer because they were so overcooked they were like rubber.  I figured I'd have better luck with the filet.  As usual, I was wrong.  It was just as rubbery.  I took my bread and called it lunch.


My friend ordered the shrimp and pasta dish.  I could see from across the table that the pasta was terribly overcooked.  It just hung around together like glue.  The shrimp were of a nice size and were actually palatable.  She ate her shrimp, I enjoyed my bread and we waited for the dreaded check.


Well, after $90.00 worth of gross food we headed for the door completely disgusted.  Our waiter was too busy performing a stand-up comedy routine to be bothered with us. The guy at the door asked us how the meal was.  I just shook my head ""no.""  He persisted and I told him about our experience.  He was appalled and went to get a manager.  He never returned.


We began the infinite elevator wait.  At this time, another employee asked how was our meal? We laughed in his face.  I told him that the one good thing about this restaurant is that my steak reminded me that I needed to get my boot resoled.


He was shocked an appalled and immediately ran out to get a manager.  Well, as luck would have it, the elevator came.  We jumped on it scared to death that they would try to further assault out palates with their version of food.  But seriously, we were only kidding ourselves.


In our heart of hearts we knew that he would not return.  sigh....",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I always go to America Restaurant because I loved the food. HOWEVER, this last trip it was terrible every day. I went for breakfast, dinner and lunch.  The last day was the worst. I asked for eggs over medium, bacon, toast and hashbrowns. The eggs came out with the white clear and yuck. The hashbrowns were so overcooked they were uneatable. The toast was stale and cold. I sent it back and got hard eggs so overcooked uneatable. I just left at that point. Hire a cook who actually wants the job it is obvious the people in the kitchen hate their job.  sorry I really bragged about this restaurant to hubby, now on our next trip we will not eat at America.",Bad,Bad,Bad

When we asked for parmesan (for a chicken with parmesan that was served without parmesan) it took 20 minutes to bring it....

"I dined here for breakfast solo on this visit. I have eaten here perhaps a hundred times over the years. The portion sizes have been reduced.


The Chicken Fried Steak is basically inedible. You can not cut it with a steak knife. The Fried Chicken Sandwich has been changed and it is not good.


On this visit I went with a simple Ham Steak and Eggs. The portion size has been greatly reduced. The fries and toast were good.

I was hapoy to have a 24 hour diner in my hotel tbh but it was ok.  I guess I wasn't too starving when I went here.  So all I had was nachos.  But they wernt my favorite nachos.  They were out of a lot of stuff I wanted so it was annoying.  Including thus chocolate desert that sounded good.  So instead I just had an apple pie and ice cream.   Was actually really good tho.  Good sized menu so I'd probably come back and try a meal there.  Staff was ok and nice as well.,Good,Good,Good
"Had one appetizing breakfast and today was worse than terrible.  Ordered an omelet, hash browns and toast.  Hash browns today were two preformed patties borrowed from McD's and deep fried to a cinder block crunch all the way thru.  The omelet  was folded up like a burrito and the american cheese was a kraft single slapped on top. Voila! I've had meals like that before, it's not ""come and get it,"" more like ""try and eat it and live""!  Had to over-rate at one star. John",Bad,Bad,
They are a diner open 24 hours.   No problem getting a table early but there was a wait on Sunday morning for breakfast.  Had an omelette that was less than spectacular.   The service was good though.   The donuts looked pretty good but I did not try them.  Probably should have.,Bad,,Good
"We stayed in Vegas for 4 days. On our last night, we came back to our rooms from antelope canyon trip. We felt hungry so look online for any 24 hr restaurant. Found America at New york New york. It was Gloria (waitress) assigned to serve us.


 


When we were ordering, Some of my friends ask nicely if she could replace the fries to onion rings, baked potato to mashed potato. She replied NO, it is what it is in there. So we said ok. When she brought the coffee my friend ordered she almost threw it in the table. so we ignore pretended everything is fine.


 


After we were one with our orders. she never came back to us. It was the guy from the kitchen who served us our food. There was no cuttleries at all. She was just hanging around by the bar. When she go near our table she  keeps talking to the caucasian guests so pleasantly. She even laughed so loud. She was so rude to us. When we ask for the bill. She let us wait for so long untill i approached diffrent waiter just to help us so we can catch our flight back to canada.


 


After i approached different server, that server told the mgr if im not mistaken. Gloria later on came to us to give us the bill. I told her separate bill, She rudely told us NO jus one bill. SO we insisted separate and she yelled saying OK ANOTHER !) MINUTES.


 


GLORIA(latenight server) shouldn't be in customer service field. She is rude, arrogant, The way we saw it SHE is so lazy and racist. It so unfair to those worker in that restaurant that are really working hard just like the kitchen guy that just suppose to hand all those orders to GLORIA but he was the who did her job.


 


Im just wondering how AMERICA can tolerate this kind of behaviour.


She shouldnt judge people base on looks. We are asians but that doesnt mean we dont have money to pay for our food,  We visit vegas regularly to gamble. We will never go back to this restaurant.",,Bad,Bad
"It was your basic Denny's style place for breakfast.  It had a little bit of a wait which wasn't unexpected.  The service was slow to get to us initially but I think the server was just coming on and we were sat before he was ready.  Once he came by, things rolled by pretty quickly.  I don't think there was anything especially remarkable about the food but it was good and it did the job.",,,
"Waitress was a bit loud with her service but overall it was fine and she was working hard. 


I went for eggs royale - the salmon looked more like ham with texture to match. I‚Äôd never had hash browns like this before but maybe this is the original recipe. Definitely not for me. 


The breakfast prices themselves seemed competitive for Vegas until I saw the bill for the filter coffee. It was basically lukewarm water with cube of oxo gravy thrown in. 


After having breakfast at the aria the following day at virtually a similar price, I realize I‚Äôm not being harsh with this review score.",Bad,,Good
"I was here with my grandma and it was just me and her.  We were sat right away; however, we sat at the table waiting for a server for over 15 minutes just to get drinks. Even after the 15 minutes no one showed up, so we decided to leave. On top of that there were two other groups of people that were sat and served right away. I would not recommend.",,Bad,Bad
"This restaurant is located on the ground floor of the New York New York hotel. It‚Äôs open 24 hours a day‚Ä¶that‚Äôs the only saving grace. We waited 40 minutes for our food only to be told that that they were out of the dish that we ordered.  The manger comped the meal, which was great‚Ä¶but when the waitress (who had a bad attitude) came out with the replacement meal it slipped out of her hands and she dropped it all over my husband‚Äôs clothes! Would have been better ordering room service‚Ä¶.",,Bad,Bad
"Went there for breakfast and it wasn't very good. It's pretty hard to screw up breakfast but they managed. The coffee was like warm soapy water, my wife ordered her eggs over-easy but the top was all raw with clear slime. She couldn't eat them. And her shredded potatoes were also raw in the middle. The toast for both of us came white, it was warm but you would never know it was in a toaster. It was quite bad, they didn't get much right, EXCEPT the bill. it wasn't high but for what we received it should have been free. The one good thing was the entire staff were very polite and friendly which to me, makes up for the horrible breakfast.",Bad,,Good
"We tried to go for lunch and we were told we have to wait because they only have 3 servers and a large party just came in. We left it went somewhere else. 


Second try we went for a late breakfast still looked like only 4 servers but we were seated right away. But It took a long time for I drink order to get placed and get acknowledgment from our waitress. Maybe 10 minutes. The juice was sour as if something was wrong with it we replaced it the cranberry juice which was very unsweet . We got that replaced as well but gave up and just had water .She finally brought coffee but never brought the cream we requested. So by the time she did, the coffee was cold another 10-12 minutes. And it was not the cream that we requested.
 As we continue to wait for our food it got to be over an hour. She never came back to check on us, not once during that time but zoomed past  many times tending to other tables. At one point I contacted another waitress to check on our food and that is when our original girl showed up. She seemed very surprised that her food was not delivered. she told me to hold on and literally not even 2 minutes later she comes back with someone else and all of our food. I told them that if it must've  been ready it must have been sitting there because there's no way that it is coincidentally all of a sudden ready now that we said something. The guy who brought the food with her swore that it just came up but soon as I touched it all of the food was cold except for the egg, they were lukewarm.. Cold pancakes, barely cooked bacon, cold toast, cold hash browns which also were burnt. You can tell I don't last minute they threw a Kraft single across the top of it and barely warmed it up it didn't even look advertising. (See pic)
This was both of our meals. I requested a manager who asked me if the girl ever checked on us and we told her she never did. Within minutes the manager corrected a few items and it was amazing how fast she got that done but it takes us over an hour to get the same food, it didn't make sense. We were on a schedule to do other things and being at this restaurant as long as we were really messed up our timetable on what was really our last full day of the trip. She charges half price for the food and by then we were disappointed only ate half of it and left.


I did make one last visit the next day, very early in the morning before we checked out. It was about 4:00 or 5:00am and the guy at the counter when you walk in was extremely nice and helpful. That is only positive experience I've had there.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We came for dinner while on the strip. I ordered chicken fried steak. It was mushy and horrible. It was supposed to come with a vegetable but it didn‚Äôt. My husband ordered fish and chips. The fish was undercooked and inedible. 
The server didn‚Äôt refresh our drinks and when she came to give us the bill, she could see that our plates had barely been touched but didn‚Äôt ask if everything was ok. 
We waited a long time for her to come back with change. 
Would never come here again",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Just had the most awful pizza. Base was ok but centre uncooked.
Place was very quiet but still the waiter forgot our drinks.
I tried to separate the base from the uncooked but it was just a mess on a plate then to cap it all the waiter asked if I wanted to box it!!! 
Just for balance my daughter enjoyed her Philly steak.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We waited a few minutes to be seated and few more minutes for drink order. This was 8:00pm on a Sunday. My daughter and I split the chicken quesadilla and an order of french fries. My mother had a slice of the strawberry cheesecake.  It was fine.  Not the best snack on this trip.


Service was good.  The next morning, the line was out the door, so maybe breakfast is their thing.  


The huge ceiling map of America  art is something to see.",,Good,Good
"Waited over 15 minutes for the waitress to initially come to our table and then waited over 45 minutes for our food to arrive once we ordered.  Waited another 15 minutes to get out bill after we finished.  And, the place wasn't crowded at all.  The food was fast-food-restaurant-quality, if that.  A friendly and apologetic waitress was appreciated but doesn't change the fact that this was not a functioning restaurant when we were there.  This is a worthless and pathetic excuse for a dining establishment.  Go hungry, instead.  You'll be happier.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We've come by when visiting for a few years.  This past visit was a disappointment.  Their Ribeye Special for USD 16.95 was currently running from 1700 til close due to COVID.  Before this special ran 1600-1900 and 0000-0400 when it was open 24/7.  We order one to share.  The ribeye was noticeably much thinner than in the past.  We asked for medium-rare.  Part of it was medium-rare, but as I progressed eating it, it was medium well, dry, a disappointment.  We were offered to redo the steak, I declined, then offered one of their donuts which I also declined.  I wanted my order to be done right the first time.",Bad,,
"We were very hungry and we saw this place had $16.95 ribeye steak meals and the picture looked bomb. Well, that was false advertising. The steak we received was really thin and overcooked and we all asked for it medium rare. It came very well done. The sides were good and the service was alright. It was midnight and no one was in there and it took about 45 to get food. I might come back if everything was closed and this was an only option.",Bad,,Good
"We were seated promptly (around 10:30pm) by a very courteous hostess. Our waitress, Jennifer I believe was her name, was very sweet and was honest when we asked about the ribs. She went back to the kitchen to ask our question instead of just making up an answer or saying I don't know. My hubby tried the BBQ rib plate. The ribs were fall off the bone but he did not care for the sauce so that kind of ruined it for him. The sides weren't the best either. I had the grilled chicken wrap and the chicken seemed old and not tasty. I ate only half of it. I would not return for lunch or dinner but maybe breakfast would be ok. I think our waitress was stuck working the whole restaurant by herself but still provided us with excellent service so that's the reason for the 3 stars, would have been lower.",Bad,Bad,Good
"We had breakfast here in August. The food was pretty average and the cost was a little on the high side for the quantity and quality. It was roomier than eating at Denny's, but to be honest, the food wasn't really any better, but it cost a lot more. We would probably skip eating here in the future.",Bad,Bad,
"We've been here before the food is ok, the prices are very good. The service is always good. We'll go here again",Good,Good,Good
We just wanted a bite before heading out the the Mob Museum (which was awesome)....$7.50 ham and cheese croissant was pretty much just an expensive croissant!,Bad,,
"We ate breakfast here each day.  The food was good, service ok, but the chairs were hard to sit in.  The booths are much more comfortable.  They do sit you right niext to other customers even when there are not many people in the restaurant.  When I worked in a restaurant many years ago, they used to seat customers every other table for privacy, then fill in as needed when the restaurant became more crowded.",Good,Bad,Good
"Hot plate with an ice cold croissant donut. These people cannot make an eggs benedict to save their lives. The hasbrowns were cooked properly. The coffee is weak and watery. The service is lacking. I went against my gut instinct and agreed with my boyfriend to eat here. Never again. This place sucks. In the middle of a casino, you'd think it'd be better everything. It's not. Worse meal thus far.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Average menu and food, prompt and courteous service, reasonable prices. DInner for two $30.00 including tax.",,,Good
"A great American food restaurant. Burgers, sandwich‚Äôs, fish n chips or steak. All good and at a great price. They also serve breakfast!",Good,Good,
"Last day of holiday and after waiting 40mins in toms urban decide to go to the America Diner
Staff were friendly and efficient but the food was bland at best, we were lucky to have gone to the blue skillet diner and the difference in taste and service was as chalk and cheese.",Bad,Bad,Good
"On our last day at the Hotel, we decided to take the easy route by getting breakfast in the America Caf√© right inside the Hotel. It was very disappointing. 


The place was pretty empty, but that included staff. Less than 1/4 of the tables were occupied, but it seemed like more tables were waiting to be bussed than were occupied. Two host-types looked around and made excuses for being shorthanded, but neither ""stepped up"" to help remedy the situation. 


How do you plan for the ""breakfast rush"" on a Sunday without adequate Staff? And why weren't the Hosts willing to roll up their sleeves and get in there to help out? 


We waited for a while for service, as was expected with the shortages of staff, but getting orders wrong, and forgetting to bring requested items is poor service that shouldn't be blamed on staffing levels. Hash browns raw in the middle are not ""crispy"", and a competent server would recognize the difference. It took multiple requests to get more hot water for Tea. And when it was finally brought out, THEN they asked whether a new tea bag was needed. Really? Shouldn't that have been asked BEFORE finally getting the hot water? 


The food was okay, but not even up to average Denny's standards. Convenience can only go so far to cover for deficiencies.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We decided to walk over from the Park to eat breakfast. 
Each entree we had was dry and the eggs were overdone. All of it was pretty much tasteless. I had the steak tip skillet-The beef tips were tender but had no flavor and the dish was very dry I requested gravy to help moisten it up and it was flour mixed white gravy with no flavor again. The best dish we had was the fruit plate . We won‚Äôt be goi g back anytime soon if at all. Do yourself a favor and eat breakfast somewhere else.",Bad,Bad,
"Stayed at Hotel NYNY and this was the only restaurant open early morning so I went here for breakfast. Ordered eggs and brioche French toast. Eggs ok but French toast was terrible, if the French toast was made with brioche bread they sure fooled me. If you want a great breakfast go next door to Il Fornaio.",Bad,,
"This has been the worst meal experience that I have had in Las Vegas. The pancakes are dry, cold and like eating paste. We each took one bite and then requested the check. Horrible. Don‚Äôt do it!  Denny‚Äôs would be better option and I don‚Äôt like Denny‚Äôs.",Bad,Bad,
"Food was good, took a while (10 mins) to get coffee, then waters we had asked for were forgotten. Breakfast then took a while and part of our order was forgotten. Hard to get a hold of the waitress to rectify. Average food, below average service.",Good,,Bad
"Ate breakfast and dinner at America. $8 all you can eat pancakes is a deal in Vegas. Had fish and chips for dinner, my wife had a burger. Satisfied with the food, but the service was very slow. 1/2 hour to order, 1/2 hour waiting for the food, and 20 minutes waiting for the check. Overall, spent 2 hours each time, and it wasn't busy.",Good,,Bad
"The wife and I came in for some salads prior to a hockey game. Neither of us were impressed with the food.


The wife had a steak salad that was deconstructed. She had to cut everything up herself. It was a lot of work. One issue was most of the food was hot with the exception of the lettuce, so it just created wilted lettuce. The other was the drizzle of basalmic. There wasn‚Äôt enough and it just became a bland mess.


I had a Cabo Wabo chicken salad. It was rather boring and bland, too.


Our service was wonderful. Renee was great. Restaurant was pretty empty at 5:00 on a Wednesday, so it was easy to get in and out before the game. 


I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of good things on the menu, but I think these are two items that need to be re-thought.",Bad,,Good
We ate here a couple of times. The prices were reasonable. The food was average nothing to write home about. The service was pretty efficient. You could get a seat pretty quickly so not a lot of waiting time. The food was hot on some occasions and not so hot on others so it was hit or miss.,,,Good
"Went to this diner for breakfast this morning and after a short wait we were seated in the far corner. A waiter was quickly on hand to serve the coffee and take our order of endless pancakes. What appeared next set the stomach churning as four large cakes together with a pot of butter and a small jug of maple syrup. I struggled near the end of a second cake. Would it not have been better to start with two and work from there, nice as they were.",Good,,Good
"We ate here a couple of times for breakfast during our stay. The first time the food was warm ( this is the part they cook and serve to you not the buffet)at best the second time the food was cold. The buffet does have a fairly good selection of food. Again, it‚Äôs hot or miss with it being hot. But, everyone was super friendly so that helped. The service one some days was quick and other days it was slower. It had nothing to do with the cross because that was fairly consistent.",Bad,,Good
"We stopped in for a late dessert. The brownie sundae was simple but filling and tasty. Service could have been more attentive ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt busy when we were there, so it was a little odd to have to wait. But otherwise, a Good.",Good,Good,Bad
The food was good but I can‚Äôt say there was anything that stuck out as being great.  I will say the breakfast burger has the most meat on it of any sandwich I think I‚Äôve ever had.,Good,,
"Food was average to slightly above. I enjoyed my meal and rest of the family seemed to be ok with theirs.


However the service was absolutely awful. Took 10-15 minutes just to get the waitress to acknowledge our presence, then another 30+ to get our food.......then I had to flag down a manager just to get the waitress to bring our check. Unbelievable!!!!",Good,Bad,Bad
"Inside New York, New York and Open 24hrs. We went there at dinner time. 


Big place, maybe that‚Äôs why the food takes so long to get to your table? 


The menu is exactly what you can expect from an American cafe, just expect 2x the price. 


If you‚Äôre coming here for breakfast, let me tell you, you‚Äôve got a lot of better options for half the time and half the price. 
P.S. Stay away from the hash browns, I couldn‚Äôt even chew them. 


Nothing here is amazing or worth going out of your way for... unless you really like gazing at a large Map of America. I only kept looking at it because I was trying to figure out how it‚Äôs valued at $1 million dollars!?",Bad,Bad,
We ate here for breakfast every morning. Food reasonable an tasty but we felt it could be a bit cheaper for the food that it is.,Good,,
"There really are no many breakfast restaurants in Vegas, surprisingly.  Unless you want an all you can eat? Those are not worth it for our family.  The breakfast here was decent.",Good,,
"There really is no place that is cheap on the Las Vegas Strip.  This restaurant is not the best, but it's not the worst either. A little cheaper than a lot of others.",Good,,
"We cam in about 11 pm ish  and we didn‚Äôt think anyone was interested in serving us .. apparently it was near shift change! The Manager came over and apologized. Drinks and food came out very late, I got mine before my sisters and was half done before hers came out.  They took her food off the bill but it was still a horrible experience. You‚Äôre in Vegas you are tired and hungry and then you get this! Even the food was subpar! Would not recommend!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I did not get to try the food, so please note that this review is based only on the service.
We were seated quickly and the place wasn‚Äôt too busy so we were looking forward to a quick meal before a show. Our server didn‚Äôt come by for a while so when he did come to get our drink  order we went ahead and ordered our meals, a couple sandwiches. As tables around us began to fill in and get their food before us I assumed that maybe our server just forgot to put in our order (especially when the table next to us that was seated about 15 minutes after we were got their steak dinner). I figured we‚Äôd ask about the order when he came to refill our drinks, which had been empty for maybe 20 minutes. He never came back though. We ended up just leaving. Unfortunate because the food looked decent.",,Bad,Bad
"Restaurant is located near New York New York  hotel lobby, it is quite large and has an open are format with an good variety menu.

The staff are very friendly and we were served quickly, food is average to what is available in Vegas.",Good,,Good
Decent food...wide selection and moderate pricing.  Nothing special just average.  Easy to get in without a reservation.  Service was good.  Just not great.  Completely adequate in every way.,Good,,Good
"This restaurant is a large, very open concept establishment with an extensive menu.  There is something for everyone.  They run a special on a New York strip dinner for $14.95.  Staff is very friendly but somewhat slow.  If you need anything extra.....jelly, butter, sour cream etc, ask for it right away or you may be waiting a long time.",Good,,

Popped in for a quick bite with my wife after a long day at the grand canyon. Ordered a starter of some type of grits with cheese and chicken I think. Then we both ordered grilled salmon as main. Eventually one main arrived with the grits starter dish. We didn't want to wait any longer so we decided just to eat what was delivered. The grits dish was a cold soggy mess. They took it away and microwaved it. It was inedible. So we just was the salmon. The salmon was presented on a bed of white 'goo'. After complaining the grits dish was removed from the bill. Disgusting mess. stay well clear of here. I have included snaps so you can see exactly what we received..,Bad,Bad,
"We were walking through and needed a quick meal. It's a neat setting and they have a lot of options on the menu. Food was good...nothing amazing, but good. My only concern was my avocado toast. I ordered the gluten free bread, indicated I was OK with the upcharge, and thought all was good. Unfortunately, I think they gave me regular bread. M stomach was very unhappy after the meal and I noticed there was no GF charge on our ticket.",Bad,Good,
"Review covers the evening steak special-$14.99. Can't recall a thinner cut.  Am willing to pay twice as much-just give me a proper steak. If you need a reference in the hotel-look no further than Greenberg's Deli for quality & portion size, at a reasonable price. Consider that your gold standard.",Bad,,
"Food isn‚Äôt anything amazing , we had breakfast and it was ok, very large portions. Husband had the steak and eggs which he did enjoy, I had corned beef hash but it was bland and unseasoned. A little dry too. Came back for late night meal at about 11pm- service was slow. Not overly impressed. Won‚Äôt be visiting again. There‚Äôs better places close by.",,Bad,Bad
"We went to America having heard that it was good for a true celiac meal and one of the children in our group needed that. The service was abomidable. We suspect that it was because they took a set tip for our group because of the size -six, including 3 children. We waited and waited for our order, at least 45 minutes, while a group of 4 were seated near us and served their meal long before us even though they arrived long after. When it was time for the check we again waited and waited and finally someone went out to search for our server. The kids were tired and cranky by this time, and I admit, running around the restaurant like savages, but still no one came to bring us our ticket so we could leave. This time the wait was at least 20-30 minutes. The restaurant was not even busy at the time. Don't waste your time!",,Bad,Bad
"I ordered a steak and potatoes. The steak was horrible. Almost tasted as if it had gone bad. I sent it back and opted not to receive a replacement after two bites. Waiter was very nice, he apologized but it wasn‚Äôt his fault. Not sure about any other meals.",Bad,,Good
"Come here expecting basic diner food. If you want good dining choose elsewhere. Ordered the rib eye special, wife ordered salad. Rib eye was a little tough and peach salad for wife, well they had no peaches so they subbed Papaya. Regular diner food.",Bad,,
"We had a quick meal here while staying in New York New York.  It was convenient and inexpensive. Much larger than was expected,  and a really great huge relief map of the US. Ok cafe fare. We tried their special rib eye steak, that was sliced way too thin to be called a steak.  Salad very good, and imagine the rest is fine.",,Good,
"Was not impressed with this restaurant. The prices were decent, but the food was bland. The hubs was only able to eat a couple of the hot wings because the texture was weird. I had the adult grilled cheese. It was okay, but not great. The server was excellent.",Bad,,Good
"We returned late from a show and found restaurant choices limited so ate here around midnight in our hotel.


Our server was great but neither the food nor speed were. 


If you're after a decent choice of food at a fairly inexpensive price, it's a good option but I can't say I'd even consider it during normal dining hours on the strip.",Bad,,

"My husband and I went to America for a late night, early morning dinner.  As always the food was great.  We ate at the bar vs. A table because there was no host and we noticed another customer was impatiently waiting.  The bartender was great, friendly and helpful but over worked.  We found the hostess Jess talking with friends, that's why there was no host to meet any guests.  We saw her talking for at least 10 minutes and many guests left without being seated.  When we left, Jess was at the host stand , did not say a word because she was busy on her cell phone.",Good,,Bad
"I first went here 10 years ago when my then new boyfriend took me to Vegas as an insane treat. It was late at night when we arrived following an 11 hour flight from London and it was the only obvious place open in NY NY. The food was good and the staff friendly if a little over attentive. We returned a couple of times over the next few years with my partners teenagers but it wasn't quite as good as we remembered it so we stopped eating there during our visits. I still wonder if the heady excitement of a new relationship and a trip to a place I had dreamed of visiting my whole life had coloured my judgment.


My partner and I returned alone a couple of weeks ago and as it was essentially our 10 year anniversary trip, we decided to eat here for sentimental reasons. It was horrible; the staff were rude, the service slow and the food awful. The water tasted of chlorine and the Jack Honey just tasted weird.


The sheer number of good reviews make me wonder if late night is simply a bad time to go but needless to say, we won't be returning at any time of the day to find out .",Bad,Bad,Bad
We were looking for a place to go and ended up here.  The menu was adequate not amazing but we all found something.  The food came out in good time but one dish was stone cold to the point we were convinced it must have been stood out over half an hour (meaning it wasn‚Äôt intended for our order). We waited for someone to come over but they didn‚Äôt so I had to go looking for our waitress.  She said she would replace the meal.  But before the time it came out the rest of the group had already finished their meal.  We were not impressed although it was removed from the bill.  Probably would not return.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"Stopped for bacon and eggs, had a lovely welcome at front counter and was seated in a booth, then we met our waitress who never smiled, slammed the coffee pot on the table and never came back until it was time to give us our check. Bacon was smoked and gotta say really nice and scrambled eggs pretty good but the extra sausage we ordered and the hash brown were Luke warm at best this and the Bad put me off, with so many places to eat don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be going back.",Good,Bad,Bad
Stopped here for late dinner as we were staying in the New York New York as well.  Wife ordered the Cabo Wabo salad with chicken.  Oldest son ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup (he wasn't really hungry).  Youngest son ordered spaghetti with meatballs from the kid's menu.  I ordered the turkey burger with fries.  Server Eddie did a good job even though it was only his 3rd week on the job.  Food arrived quickly and was good.  Nothing amazing but nothing disappointing.  The visit served its purpose.,Good,,Good
"This was our second try in 2 years, last year we already had a weird experience, but after a day of walking and visiting the Strip casinos we decided to take dinner in a restaurant in the hotel we stayed.


Our waitress was quite friendly when we arrived, but once seated in the nice boots on the side the weird things started. My girlfriend ordered an ice-tea and I wanted to have a light beer. At this point the waitress asked to see some ID... I am 47 years old and trust me, after several days of Vegas, one does not start to look younger. When I mentioned that I was over 40, she still insisted I showed some ID. At this point she told me they were out of light beers in bottles... I decided to take an Ice-tea also so I did not have to show my birth-certificate to get some 'heavier' beers. 


To order food we asked about the size of the sandwiches on the menu. We were told these were quite big and enough. Until the moment we asked to order 1 to share, as we already had a heavy meal at noon. At this point the waitress seemed to have changed opinion and it seemed weird that we only ordered 1 plate... 


In short: Customer service <5/10. Food 6/10.


Only if during our next visit we are again very tired we might visit this 'restaurant' again... there are plenty of alternatives around in NY/NY or surrounding hotels.",,Bad,Bad
"I have been to America almost every trip to Las Vegas. 
The attention to minor things is starting to show. How do you have two people order the same meal and both ask for med-rare on the meat and one comes well done. I am told that the reason is they are using a ""thinner"" cut for their Rib-Eye and it is hard to get it to cook to med-rare. Really you want to go with that story? So why was one done right and one wasn't? Forget about one did you?",Bad,,
"We were staying at NYNY and after a late night gambling session we decided to share a few small plates here.


Service was good and prices are ok but the food was really naff - not fresh and most likely microwaved.  Perhaps the kitchen can't be bothered after midnight.


On the plus side, they do have a donut and coffee bar just as you go in, they do takeaways and their coconut donuts are really good.


The restaurant however was a complete waste of money.",Bad,Bad,Good
"Seems like after 11pm in New York New York this is the only place to eat.
Reminds me of a late nite truck stop place.
Ordered the Pizza, but it had that frozen supermarket pizza taste that came out of a microwave.
Avoid unless you are desperate.",Bad,Bad,
"The food is nothing special, but not bad either.
The staff seem uninterested, not very friendly.
Taking the 5 minute walk to Denny's is a better option for breakfast.
Dinner didn't ""wow"" us either.",Good,,Bad
"The line to get in was way too long so I grabbed some donuts to go.  The donuts here are HUGE (like double donuts).  The most interesting one was a butterfinger one.  Being that I was on a diet I only sampled them rather than eat them.  Noticed that the donuts all were extremely sweet.  The chocolate was the sweetest and not far behind was the cinnamon, my favorite was the butterfinger maybe because the salty nuts helped minimize the sweetness.",Good,,
"We went for an early dinner and despite being one of the only people in there, received very poor service.  It was about 5 minutes before we were even acknowledged, the food took forever to come and our waitress barely checked in on us.  The food was very average as well.",Bad,,Bad
"Ate here for breakfast & dinner twice. Service is 50/50, some waiters are speedier than others. Portions are good sized, so the value is there. Large variety on the menus. Clean, spacious, staff is all very polite. Managers cruise thru and check in on you. Nice bar. Breakfast was quite hearty. Our server at dinner (Michael) pointed out a special we weren't aware of, so it saved us some money.",Good,Good,Good
"Food is just ok. Probably the best things me on the menu is the giant pretzel, burger is a normal diner style burger. Deserts are average for an affordable casino restaurant. Ribeye steak special was overly fatty and cheap grade meat.",Good,,
"Huge Portions, Reasonable Price, Quality and Service Lacking. Breakfast this morning consisted of two orders of Blueberry Pancakes, which could easily have been one as the portion was so big and we'll presented. Unfortunately that is where the enjoyment ended. The pancakes we mediocre at best and while visually appealing, where actually quite dry. Service less than stellar. Won't need to revisit America (the restaurant) again.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I was staying at the nearby Excalibur and was yearning for a good, hearty breakfast. After doing a little tripadvisor and yelp research, I landed on America due to its proximity and reviews. America definitely did not disappoint (America is open 24 hours).


I was seated immediately, waited on seconds later and a omelet was on my table in less than 15 minutes. I was impressed by the level of service. The omelet was delicious! The hashbrowns were so/so, but the wheat toast was also delicious. Coffee was piping hot and I was given my own carafe. There was a donut bar which I didn't get to try, but if I were to come back, I will definitely try the donuts. Overall, great experience and spent around $21 not including tax and tip for breakfast for one. I would definitely return.",Good,Good,Good
Not usually a breakfast person but stopped in anyway ordered the chicken fried steak it came with 2 eggs hash browns and a bread of choice ....it came out in minutes... huge portions ... tasted great very filling ... reasonably priced,Good,,
We went after 11 pm one night and they weren't busy. The service was slow and the food was just ok. The mural of the US they have on a wall is neat to see.,Good,Good,Bad
"Looks great -- that USMap sculpture is fantastic!  The food is one or two steps above a good diner. The drinks are typically over-priced -- costing $13-14 for girly pink drinks, easily jumping to over $20 for a familiar tequila mix.  The food is okay.  The service is also okay.  If you have teens, this is the place for them at New York, New York.",Good,Good,Good
We had a breakfast there (and had enough for the rest of the day ;) ) ordered pancakes and egg/sausage. The pancakes were very dryish to eat and not as expected in the US. The eggs were fine. I ordered a glass of milk and as expected in the US got half a cow of milk ;) as said enough for one day to eat and drink. Just had better food in other places so this one is rated average,Bad,,
"I normally dont like writing bad reviews..but this was the one place my husband and i didn't like....first impression..was not greeted by server...basically was ignored the whole time. The manager was the one who was more attentive to us.
Food was average. I had the big salad with tequila chicken and my husband had the chicken parmaggia. Price was ok. Not something i would go back too..even if it is opened 24/7",,Bad,Bad
"This low priced restaurant with average food. Service was below average, we waited a good 10 minutes at the maitre d desk before someone came to greet us. The restaurant only had 3 tables, so not sure why the wait. We were seated and then waited 25 minutes before someone returned to take our order. During this time we had multiple employees walk past us and ignore us. Food was ok, servings were large.",Good,,Bad
Stopped in here for a late dinner. There is a wide range of food and prices are right.  The quality reminded me of Denny's type food and was ok.  It is open 24 hours.,Good,,
"Ate here the last day of our stay in hotel New York New York in Las Vegas. I read some mixed reviews on TripAdvisor, but decided to eat here anyway. Interior is somewhat hidden now that there seem to be some renovation work going on. When we were seated at our table in the almost empty dining hall we were greeted by our server who finished every sentence with ‚ÄúY‚Äôall‚Äù‚Ä¶ very annoying after the second time, still he kept this going on. When we ordered our food we wanted each a glass of wine also. The white wine one was not available ‚Äúbecause we are havin‚Äô us some works, folks‚Äù (or something like that). The red one (standard Merlot) seemed not available either for the same reason. Our food came out of the kitchen under a some sort of metal tray (as you would expect for room service): how far is this kitchen?
Food itself was OK for the price, but the atmosphere (especially the waiter) made this experience  annoying. Never again.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Stopped by for a bite to eat while walking around the hotel. Our service was absolutely awful. We waited 20 minutes just to order our drinks, then another 15 just to get them. Our waiter was not friendly and took his good old time to serve us. 


I ordered my burger no pink and received it mooing. By the time our food arrived, we weren't even hungry anymore. We never received refills or even asked how our food was, hence why I never got to send my burger back. There was no other waiters to even wave over. Our experience here was awful and I would not recommend.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We ate here cause a friend wanted their pancakes.. then she ordered the waffles, I ordered the eggs, bacon and toast. We also ordered the biscuits and gravy, which we sent back, no sausage, just a white cream on the biscuits. waiter was busy, he tried, but he had to be looked for a few times. I would not eat here again. Denny's is better.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Service was good, and the food was OK. I don't think any of us were blown away; however, the french fries were outstanding.",Good,,Good
"Our meal at America was incredibly disappointing. Everything about the service was fine but the food was incredibly tasteless and bland. The omelets are a little rubbery and the had a very strange aftertaste to it. Definitely nothing great!


However, America is open 24 hours a day, so is a viable option if you are coming home late from drinking and don't really care what you are eating!


The donut selection is good, but I would recommend skipping America altogether and heading over to Tom's Urban, where the food is great and the prices are comparable.",Bad,Bad,Good
"Well, if I could avoid breaking my eardrums while the guy on the cherry picker moved around to build (or rebuild?) the big wall inside the restaurant, the food may have tasted better. The coffee is super weak, and it's typical food...but it was not bad. The wait staff made the best of a difficult situation.",,Bad,Good
"Went in to have breakfast. Thought they had an all you can eat breakfast, but found out after being seated that it's only for pancakes. Stayed anyway. Wife and I had breakfast and it was okay. Nothing to wow over. Go to the breakfast buffet at Chin Chin located in the same New York New York Hotel lobby for a better variety of breakfast items.",Good,,
"We wanted to go to Hersey's so we found this place for breakfast. 


We sat down and service was fast. Kinda to fast, we had just opened the menu when she was back to take our order. We sent her away. 


We ordered. I wanted a cup of tea, sick of drinking vast quantities of coffee. 


It came as a kit. I hate that. There was a thing full of hot water, a T bag and a mug. I put the bag into the thing of hot water, the longer I left it, the hotter the glass item was and harder to poor into the mug. 


The food was ok, nothing special, service was basic and just wanted us in and out so she can get the tips faster. 


But would have got a better score if I could have had a Tea how it should be. 


PS American - English Breakfast Tea is served with milk not honey and lemon",Good,,Good
The food was OK nothing bad there but the server was short with me and hardly saw her had to wait for check after about 15 minutes when done oribaly a good place if half empty,Good,,Bad
"I have dined here over a dozen times and everything was always very good.  This visit I ordered an omelet with cheese, sausage and ham with toast and hashbrowns.  They ran out of hashbrowns, the omelet was made with fake eggs and fake cheese.  I have never had this before.  This coffee shop has always been excellent.  My wife had a wrap that she enjoyed.  She said it was ""over dressed"", whatever that means.


I added many photos.  I was disappointed on this visit, but will give them another shot in the future.  They do have some great Lunch and other Specials.  The service was very good.  Open 24/7.",Good,Bad,Good
"We ate here on a Tuesday morning.  It wasn't busy at all.  Our food came out relatively quickly, but my uncle and I both had freezing cold eggs.  I never send anything back (I've seen that movie...) So I just ate them anyhow and just let the waitress know.  She was very apologetic and said she'd speak to the cook.  The rest of the food was very tasty.  Prices were decent and they had a pretty good selection for breakfast.  Would eat here again, even with the glacial eggs.",Good,Good,Good
Great steak but mashed potato was instant and like wall paper paste. Very bland dish with just green beans which really let down a great steak.,Bad,,
"So if you need a sandwich or just an American meal ie sandwich, chicken, salad, regular fare this resturant was price fairly and had a extensive menu",Good,,
"This place is a typical 24 hr cafe just off the casino floor. It is spacious, clean, and the decor is interesting.  I had a chicken ceasar salad and my wife had a burger.  No complaints.",Good,Good,
"The prices at America are very reasonable.  Our one time experience as far as the food quality was so /so.  We ordered wings, onion rings and a beef dip sandwich.  Everything seemed extra greasy. We didn't try anything else on the menu, so it could have been what we ordered.",Good,,
"We'd past here while in the casino on a few occasions and decided to try it for breakfast. We were seated immediately but had to wait nearly 10 minutes to order and it took another 15 minutes for the food to arrived. I opted for the All you can eat Pancakes and a milkshake. My wife went for the New York Deli Skillet and tea. Because we'd been waiting almost 30 minutes I was hungry and ate the three pancakes quickly and wished to order more. We couldn't get hold of our waitress or any other waitress for another 10 minutes and then I ordered more pancakes which took another 15 minutes to appear. Even though there was plenty of waiting staff around nobody seemed to be available to order a third set of pancakes ad we couldn't be bothered waiting another 15 minutes to get them. I don't know if it's a ploy for the All you can eat or just poor service.
The food was ok but the service left a lot to be desired.",Good,,Bad
"Well we tried breakfast at this restaurant on the morning of 12 December we did not go early about 0945 am. The food was of good quality and everybody enjoyed their food however the service time to receive the food we waited 40 minutes which to me is too long, on a Monday Morning I would consider that our timing was not during the busy morning rush and so I have to say that waiting so long is really not acceptable, especially when you are expected to give a tip.",Good,,Bad
We stayed at NY NY hotel and it was an easy choice for us to visit. We got there late and the options were not that many. Whatever we had did not meet the quality standards at all. I personally had a salad that was prepared probably in the morning or the previous day and it was kept in the fridge. The special though might be interesting since many people were ordering that. Can not tell. Not an option if you are really hungry...,Bad,Bad,
Walking around NewYork New York trying to deside what to eat for supper. I saw the rib steak special 10 Oz for $15 . The mashed potatoes were great the steak on the other was fatty  but cooked the way I liked . I needed rolaids because I kept tasting it . The service was outstanding and very attentive. I would recommend this restaurant.,Good,Good,Good
"We stopped in here to pick up much raved about Cronus. They're a cross between donut and croissant. This place offers different toppings like honey glaze, sugar, chocolate, and Butterfinger. We got two honey glazed cronuts and put a little bit of cinnamon on the second one. Both were good but so very sticky and messy. Worth trying once but that's about it.",Good,,
"Wound up at this place because we needed a meal at 1 AM. Fries were great, everything else (including the service) exceedingly mediocre. Only if you must.",Good,,
We were underwhelmed with our meals at America but it was among the cheaper meals we had if you are looking for a deal. We didn't get to try it but there was also a donut at.,Bad,,
"I ordered a burger and it was definitely frozen and dry. I had to put ketchup over it to make it moist. My husband had to ask to get his water refilled...as you know it is a competitive market In Las Vegas for food...we could have gone somewhere cheaper and had better service (as we did in downtown Vegas). It was edible but not to many healthy options to choose from. Side salad was good with ranch. The server didn't look like she wanted to be there either. Overall, I would not recommend this place unless you wanted coffee and a donut.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I had chicken parm with linguini. They grilled the chicken and then added the sauce and parm. It was definitely not the way I'm accustomed to chicken parm. I was not a fan. My friend liked her dinner, though. The atmosphere was nice!",Bad,Good,
"I will say, the food here is very good - but it's very good at most places in Vegas. The service, although friendly, is extremely slow - despite being among only probably 6 or 7 tables filled out of probably 50, it took a good 30-45 minutes for us to get our food. This isn't the first time we've been there, and we've had the same experience each time... Apparently we have short memories!",Good,Bad,Bad
"The staff working here are wonderful. They go out of their way to be polite. The food is normally good but we did have a steak from here that was horrible and not edible. So, for the many times we ate here, having one bad meal isn't too bad.",Bad,,Good
"We were starving following an NHL match and didn't want to hunt around forever for food. This place was pretty quiet so we went here.
The pizza I ordered would have been lovely if the cheese had been fully melted but in places it wasn't and it just put me off completely. 
The chips were lovely.
My husbands rack of ribs were okay.
The decor was nice and there was an interesting model of the US on the ceiling.
The service was good.
The price was too high for the quality",,Good,Good
"I've had several menu items from here, and the best is the pretzel and some of the salads, Disappointed in the regular meals and breakfast is overpriced, even for Vegas!",Bad,,
"Visited here recently. My partner went for the ribeye steak special which he thoroughly enjoyed. However, I went for the chicken Parmesan which was awful. Came with pasta which has no sauce on it and was very dry. Didn't touch most of it. One thing I can say is that the guy serving us was lovely and went out of his way to deliver a Good",,,Good
"The place itself is quite big and nicely decorated. Staff is very nice and friendly. You have to wait a little bit and the food is ok. Not the best but not bad. Big pasta portions! Do not try the cheapest red wine, very difficult to digest!",Good,Good,Good
"Probably the worst restaurant I've been to in a while. Some of our group refused to eat their meal. Seemed like a nasty, overpriced Denny's with weird stuff on the walls. There was only like 4 other tables with people in them, at 7PM. With that few tables active, the service was still not great. Food came quick enough but server was usually nowhere to be seen. Felt sick for quite a while after. Do yourself a favor, stay away.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"If you want quick American food, this isn't bad. It's inexpensive and fairly fast. Nothing special, but decent standard American food.",Good,,
"We went to this restaurant for convenience as we were short on time. The service was slow and less then friendly. The food took forever, there were multiple other tables that arrived after us that were served their food before us. Apparently the overcooked my friend's burger, and while they tried to make up for it by comping his meal and giving us free donuts, the food was awful. The turkey burger looked like it was deep fried, and the veggie burger was burnt on one side, and barely cooked on the other side. It was odd.


There are so many other food options in NYNY, and vegas in general, you do not need to eat here for any reason.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I have always loved the map on the ceiling and it didn't disappoint when I took my preteen kids.  The service was a little slow, the ribeye was just average.  They have home made donuts and super cool deserts that were very good.  Overall it was an okay diner style dinner.",Good,Good,Bad
"The service was very good. We appreciated the fact that there weren't many people there. We were tired of all the blinking and noise of Vegas. But the food was a dull, and the choices limited. The prices were fair.",Bad,,Good
"We tried to have breakfast this morning at the America restaurant.  It looked very quiet and we could see lots of tables free.  We waited to be seated and the staff took unusually long to come over and asked how many.  The staff went over and talked to other staff for a few more minutes and came over and said we would have to wait out of the way next to the bar while they find a table and get it ready!  We stood near the bar as instructed and after 2 minutes,  the bar staff told our children off for standing near the bar!!  I went back over to the wait staff and asked them how long do we need to wait as we have just been told off for being near the bar.  The staff continued to talk to each other and looked like we were inconveniencing them by politely asking them,  and said we will just have to wait a few more minutes until the table is ready.  We waited a few more minutes and then gave up as we had to move away from the bar and were blocking people and it was pretty embarrassing and uncomfortable.  We then went to another hotel for food,  I politely told the staff that we will have to go,  not once did they apologise for the poor experience and just sarcastically said,  ""ok well you have a great day"". 


Needless to say we are very disappointed by this and did not expect such poor standards from NY NY hotel.  We will not be spending any more money here during our stay or leaving any tips and will certainly be leaving poor reviews as it's unfair on potential customers to have the same poor experience we have had.  


We have come a long way from the UK to stay here and are a party of 6 celebrating  a 40th birthday.  Regret selecting this hotel now.",,Bad,Bad
"Looks from the outside OK, but inside it is just a big cantine, low priced restaurant and the food is below average. Only eat there one time, and will not go back. Service was below average, we needed to wait for service 10 min, even though the restaurant was only 10 % full, and the food was 25 min underway and did not come at the same time, and we were only 2 people",Bad,Bad,Bad
There's lots of sweet stuff on their menu! From churro waffles to amazing donuts. I had an omelet that was cooked beautifully and was very tasty. Everyone at the table was happy. The donut selection is amazing.,Good,Good,
"This is not a cheap meal option, but few places on the Strip would be. Equally, the food is not grossly expensive and you do get good portion sizes. Lots of seating so we had no problem getting a table. Delivery of food to the table was a little slow, but in part that's because it was freshly prepared. So in summary, not great, but not bad.",Good,,
We stopped in here for lunch. It's a bit of a diner style restaurant with quick service and non pretentious dishes. It's definitely one of the more reasonably priced eateries in that area. Regular fare without too many gimmicks but good value.,Good,,Good
"Breakfast here! 


Patty was our waitress....she was Amazing!  Really quick with orders, attentive and friendly! 


Food was ok! Good value but lacking in flavour! Would try again, probably just ordered the wrong things!",Good,,Good
A very bland restaurant when there are so many better choices in Vegas. On top of an uninspiring menu we were served raw chicken which had to be taken back to the kitchen and re cooked however we still had to pay for it?! Burger was extremely bland and the main course chicken was frozen and re cooked. If you're in Vegas there are a million better places than this.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"I'm going to be completely fair and state up front that if America were a restaurant in my hometown, I'd be a lot more thrilled about it (we're restaurant challenged). In Vegas, it just doesn't stand out, but if you're looking for a moderately-priced, no-frills American meal, here you shall have it.


On large family vacations, I've eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner here. I wasn't all that impressed with lunch and dinner. Fairly generic stuff. It's certainly not terrible. It's prepared well enough for what it is, but it doesn't leave you clamoring for more. To provide an example, my grandmother wants to eat here for breakfast nearly every day, and that's because she likes Eggs Benedict that is just plain, unadventurous, don't-do-anything-fancy-to-my Eggs Benedict with a side of wheat toast. On trips with friends, I've popped in for 3 a.m. pancakes, and in that role, this 24-hour restaurant is a welcome player on NY-NY's restaurant roster.


I would recommend regular dining hours to:
- families
- people on a budget
- anyone looking for something quick and casual but a bit more substantial than a slice or a dog


For the 3 a.m. pancake set, it's a nice respite. Generally nearly empty at those hours, thus a good slow-down-and-relax spot. And the giant 3D map of America suspended in the dining room, with its little embellishments representative of the different states, is certainly worth a look.",Good,Good,
"Happy to see there's someplace to get breakfast in the early morning. We found the American eatery in the New York New York, It wasn't that crowded but the service was slow.  The food was average but welcomed.  They definitely need to be more professional in their service to customers regardless of the time.",Good,Good,Bad
"After having a buffet lunch, my family did not want a big dinner, so we went to the America restaurant inside the New York New York Hotel where we were staying.  The d√©cor is nice with a big sculpture map of U.S.A. hanging from the ceiling identifying major cities and landmarks.


We ordered our food which arrived in reasonable time.  Unfortunately, the food was not good, given the usual high hotel prices.  The server kept hovering back to our table every few minutes to ask if everything was okay and if we needed anything more.  At one point, I put my cutlery down just take a break from eating and she came over to ask if I was finished and she could take my plate away!",Bad,Good,Good
This restaurant is in the New York New York hotel and it looks like the fresh baked donuts are a big item although I didn't try it. The prices are a bit high but typical for a hotel restaurant. They have a map of the entire United States on the ceiling that is very interesting showing highlights from many of the different states. The waitress staff is very nice friendly and helpful.  All in all this was just an average experience but I ate there two mornings in a row so I must find it acceptable!!,Good,Good,Good
"I've been to this restaurant in the New York New York a few times, for both dine-in and room service. America is open 24 hours and has a good selection of food -- everything from small appetizer plates to more substantive meals (fish & chips comes to mind). I'm a chicken wings fan and find them, here, to be very good -- awesome flavour! As well, the ""Bahama mama"" drink is quite dangerous in that you could probably down a lot of them no problem!


Staff were always very friendly and happy to help.


If you do the room service option at NYNY, you'll be served by this restaurant, so you know you'll have a good selection.",Good,Good,Good
"We decided to try this place for breakfast and it was ok.


Nothing on the menu will blow your mind but it offers quite a few standard options you might expect.


The service was very good, attentive and friendly. The steak and eggs was ok, nothing too special but then again, neither was the price.


I wouldn't go out of your way to eat here but it's not bad overall.",Good,,Good
This is a good place for breakfast or for the basics. Pretty good value and tasty no frills food. The wait staff are friendly and the donuts are fantastic.,Good,,Good
America is a 24 hour restaurant in New York New York that my wife and I had breakfast in twice.   The food was average - somewhat like Denny's or iHop.   The service was good as well - it reminded me of a standard fast food restaurant that caters to large groups of people and moves food and people in and out quickly.  A handy and convenient place for a quick bite.,Good,,Good
"We ate all our breakfasts here during our stay. The food was plentiful, reasonably priced and flavorful. You never walked away hungry. The staff are friendly and our breakfast was served in a timely manner. My husband ordered the BLT as he was told about how good it was. The sandwich was piled high with bacon, lettuce and tomatoes and was very filling. We went there one night around 9:00pm for supper and it was not very busy. We were seated right away but did not get waited on right away and 10 minutes later got water and waited another 15 minutes to place our order. My husband ordered the BLT and I ordered a cheeseburger with fries. Almost another 30 minutes before our order came. We noticed a few tables get up and leave as they were waiting to get served. We asked our server how long before the food would arrive and she said it will be here eventually and walked away. When our food finally arrived we were shocked to see my husbands BLT as it had only 1 piece of bacon on it and 1 tomato slice ! We asked the server for more bacon and tomato and she said we are short staffed in the kitchen. Took awhile for the bacon and tomato to come. My fries were not hot. Complained to  shift manager no discount on our meal and said short staffed. Would recommend eating breakfast there but not later in the evening.",Bad,,
"So we stopped in for breakfast/lunch late on a Monday morning.  We had an omelet and breakfast burrito, both of which were okay, but bill was $35, which was a bit high considering it was breakfast food and not fancy food at that. Waitstaff was par, not engaging or friendly, but perfunctory.  However menu is very varied if you don't know what you want.",Good,,Good
"Our last night in this crazy town - we figured we would go and eat 'traditional' American food - so where better than a place called America


The place was empty


It did have a pretty cool 3D map of the USA hanging from the ceiling 
Our waitress for the evening - Geneva - did a sterling job, but it wasn't as if she had many other distractions


My wife has the all day breakfast steak and eggs and found the steak a little dry - but sufficient
I had the BBQ platter - the half chicken was good, but sadly the ribs were awful
Flavourless and dry


It's not a bad place....its just not a great place either",,Good,Good
"At at America twice for breakfast during my stay.  The first time I had a breakfast with eggs and pancakes.  The second time I had an omelette.  The omelette was on the rubbery side.  I suggest asking for real eggs instead of the liquid egg mixture.  That might have been the difference.  The first time I asked for real eggs.  Overall, breakfast was average - nothing spectacular.


The servers were nice and pleasant but not overly friendly.  If you want someplace close for breakfast, this restaurant will do.  Otherwise, check around for options.",Good,,Good
"On our way out to the airport, we stopped to try the Ribeye special. Not bad for $15 in Vegas. Good flavor, a little fatty, but it is a Ribeye. My wife had a salad that looked great and she said it tasted good. We enjoyed the map of the U. S. on the ceiling.",Good,Good,
"Had a late breakfast here with my girls. It was good but not great. Service was really good. Overall fun for the kids to look around and talk about the states. food was worth eating but not a special or memorable. We did get a 7 pack of donuts. If you get a donut pack, be aware its only the regular/booring ones you can get. If you go up with kids, they will want the fancy ones (a slight bait the kids for more money but what the heck, probably I would go Krispy Kreme at the Excal the next time. If it is there and handy, probably worth stoping",Good,Good,Good
this was more a place for the locals.food was quite plain and basic..very dimly lit inside.on the plus the service was very quick,Bad,Bad,Good
"Food was OK but they were really difficult about splitting the check. Service was good otherwise.  All in all unremarkable, but if you're hungry it'll do.",Good,,Good
Reviews were mixed but since they have a wide menu we tried it. $70 for 3 meals and only the spaghetti & meatballs was edible. Shrimp scampi was 4 shrimp on a bed of dried out noodles and an over cooked over peppered dry steak. I had 2 veggies (gluten free)..they mixed the barely cooked green beans on with the steamed squash..it was not appetizing to look at much less eat.  Worst food of a 9 day trip.,Bad,Bad,
"America has typical American fare (for breakfast, lunch, and dinner). If you go in expecting a decent/average American meal you won't be disappointed. I had an egg white frittata that had way too much feta cheese but was otherwise just fine. My husband had an egg/bacon/hash brown plate and enjoyed it from what I could tell by his empty plate. There is a donut counter at the entrance if you are in the mood for something quick to go. On a more upbeat note: our server was just lovely. Very friendly and prompt.",Good,,Good
I ordered the chicken piccata and my chicken was under cooked to the point it was pink and they told me it was just tender i assure you it was not fully cooked my pasta was bland and overwhelmed with lemon flavor also there were stray other noodles in with my pasta I have never refused food before but I did here. Worst dinning experience ever!!,Bad,Bad,
"Several of our party ate breakfast at America one morning. Food was average, interior whimsical, service was slow.",,Bad,Bad
Generally I find the food here disappointing.  It's okay if you just want a quick meal and aren't expecting much. We had the club sandwich and chicken noodle soup.   The waitstaff are friendly and really hustle.  It's priced about average I'd say.  Not too expensive.,,,Good
"A group of us had dinner at America.
The space is large, the food was good and the service was great.
They had a good steak special and many of us enjoyed it.",Good,Good,Good
"I used to love this place but the affair is over now.  


I visited for some late night eats after enjoying the Casino and both my husband and I had the Rib Eye Special.  It's gone up a couple of dollars but if it tastes good is still great value.  


That's where the problem lies.  Whilst my steak was quite nice it was overcooked and the potato not very tasty at all.  Unusually the best part of the entire meal were the vegetables which are normally like bullets!  My husband's steak was tough, overcooked and basically inedible.  


When the server took the plates away he didn't bat an eyelid at the uneaten food and didn't attempt to see if there was a problem.  


I don't think we will be back anymore, perhaps it's time this place was revamped completely and the theme was changed,  It's tired and unfriendly. Not like it used to be :-(.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We went there for a dinner when we checked in NY hotel. We had a set menu, the service was good and the foodcwas average with pretty large portions. Would definitely find way more better options in Vegad",Good,,Good
"we ate here once and that was more than enough. 
The quality of food was average at best, we left most of our meal as it was hideous. 
I wouldn't bother to eat here, choose somewhere else",Bad,Bad,
"We needed a place for a group of 7, and it was close to our hotel, the Tropicana. Food, service and restaurant are just ok, but certainly not a destination....  There are so many other places to experience, but this was great for a group, ease and location.


The most interesting thing about America was the bakery at the entrance.... great visuals of the actual bakery items, so don't know how good it actually tastes. 


I also liked the giant map / art of America that literally spans the entire restaurant...


Our server was not the greatest, but she tried....


Again, truly felt simply like a hotel restaurant.",Good,Good,
"It's good for quick dinner, the coffee options are too fat and I do not recommend if you are not used to this kind of food.",Bad,,
"We came here for breakfast and it was decent enough.  I had the eggs and sausage.  The eggs were small, maybe mediums and the potatoes were tasty, but there wasn't very much of them.  The pork sausage links tasted okay, but it was hard to tell because they were so salty.  There is a pastry counter at the front of the restaurant filled with delicious looking pastries.  Unfortunately, their taste and texture didn't live up to their appearance.  I had the apple pastry and found it to be a little dry and stale.",Bad,,
"The restaurant is beautiful and tables are well spaced, BUT, on december 25th I went with my fiance and parents for lunch. Terrible idea. We ordered a ceasar salad and while eating there was a huge string of hair in it. Also, we ordered some chicken fingers and it came extremely spicy. My mother also found a string of hain on her napkin. Totally discussing. The manager took the orders out of the check, but I wouldnt go back to this restaurant again.",Bad,Bad,
"The food was just okay. Nothing special. We spent just as much eating Cheeseburger at PH and it was fabulous. I had a burger and fries (the burger was a little dry and seemed like a frozen patty to me, the fries were good), hubby had a philly cheesesteak and he said it was REALLY dry. So overall not impressed since it cost just as much as the fancier places.",Bad,Bad,
"Ate there three times -- once for brunch on our arrival, and twice for breakfast.  Host was super nice, and 1st server (lunch) was great, and the food was pretty good.  2nd  time,  breakfast, service and food were okay.  On our final visit, the service was poor and the server made us feel like she was doing us a favour.  Also, watch out - if you order a substitution (ie- my mother asked for cottage cheese *instead* of the cream cheese that comes with the bagel she ordered), they gave her both and upcharged for the cottage cheese.",Good,,
"DONT eat here.  Stopped in for lunch with friends while in Vegas for the NFR.  Ordered appetizers- potato skins and wings.  Potato skins were over cooked (we would have been better off buying a bag of beef jerky), chicken wings were soggy.  A few in our party ordered burgers and I had a chicken Caesar salad.  Burgers were way over cooked  and dried out and the fries tasted old and like they had been reheated.  The chicken Caesar salad was overly salty and the chicken so dry that you couldn't even chew it.  The waiter delivered our food and never came back to check on us.  The place is a joke and overpriced!!  We would have been better off eating at McDonalds.  Out of a party of 6 not one of us had a decent meal.  Seriously..how do you screw up wings, potato skins, a hamburger and a salad of all things??",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We have ate at this restaurant at the end of the evening trying to find a place we can sit to eat quiet after having listen to the music of the New York New York for a few hours. Restaurant is not noisy and we had a wonderful moment sharing all together (a group of friends) a very tasty and surprising nachos. This was for sure one of the best I ever ate in my life. We were 6 together and we had enough. For the rest of the menu, this is all american food like burgers, fried chicken and pizzas. It is good but not exceptional. It is why I suggest you try the nachos rather than anything else. You will not be disappointed. :)",Good,Good,
"I really liked the big US map in here. However, the breakfast was only ok. It is worth it to take a walk inside to view the map. If you are a family it is probably good.",Good,Good,
We were looking for a quieter late night spot to eat dinner. America seemed to have a wide variety of options. The staff was very friendly. The food was mostly bland but decent for the price. This would be a good place for seniors or families as it is a bit quieter than most other places in the area.,Good,Good,Good
"This was the worst place I have even been to.  The service was just horrible.  If you are thirsty just plan on staying that way they take your order and never come back.  Someone else delivered the food other than our server.  I ordered ""toast"" with my breakfast and received soft bread - not toasted.  After tracking someone down they sent it back to be toasted and the excuse was that ""The toast girl was new and learning"" seriously that is the dumbest thing I have ever heard in my life.  Overpriced, Bad and horrible service.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Just the standards, pancakes, bacon eggs, but they were all good. I really liked the hash browns. They just seemed to be cooked a little better than most I have had, and had a nice flavor and crunch!",Good,,
Breakfast quality average. Service average.  Would have liked food and coffee a little more on the hotter side.  Expected more from the NYNY,,Bad,
"We had breakfast here one morning during our recent stay in Las Vegas.  Service was nice, food was good.  Value was typical Las Vegas value.  We had a nice breakfast.  Portions were very big so you should not go away hungry.  Nice place for a quick meal.",Good,Good,Good
"This place is open all night long, so it's a good place for a late dinner/early breakfast. The donuts are delicious! The food is just average diner food. I enjoyed the Nutella pancakes but they were a bit dry.",Good,Good,
"The food here isn't bad, but it's not ""wow"" either and considering that, the prices you are paying are ""wow"" prices.  The service though is very special, warm and personal - something you rarely find in Las Vegas.


Dumplings (see pic) were okay, a little over cooked and rubbery.


We ate Chicken Noodle Soup (see pic) which was very tasty and enjoyable with hand made noodles which tasted great.  Also Shrimp Scampi (see pic) which was a lovely pasta tagliatelle (wide long strip) with huge whole prawns or shrimp (depending on which side of the world you come from!) in a lovely garlic cream sauce.  This was awesome!


This place doesn't look like much but the service and the food make it a gem, just wish the prices would come down a little.",Good,Bad,Good
Had been eating dinner at America for the last 5 visits to Vegas. Food and service was good prior to this last visit. This visit food was awful and service was poor. Only saw server 2 times and had to actually get out of seat to find him to get the bill. Will not be eating there again. Very disappointing.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"There were 9 in our group. We got seated fairly quickly since there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. We ordered our drinks. I got a Fruity Booty, which has 4 different liquors and pineapple juice. Well let me tell you, all I could taste was pineapple juice. Think they forgot the alcohol! My mother-in-law ordered one as well, she said hers was strong. She also ordered a pepsi which the waiter kept forgetting to bring. She had to ask him 3 times for it, no joke! Our food took a long time to come. I know we were a larger group but like I said the restaurant was pretty much empty. I ordered a BLT, which was not very good. The fries that came with it, were indeed good. The d√©cor in here is pretty cool. Prices are average for this type of place. Overall, I would not eat here again based on poor wait service and food quality.",Bad,Good,Bad
"Had breakfast, 5 in our party.  Service was on the slow side, has a large cafeteria feel to the place. Food was OK, not that I would run back for another meal however.",Good,,Bad
"A very unadventurous, average sort of a place.  Service was fine, and people friendly, but the food was bland and uninteresting.",Bad,Bad,Good
"We ate breakfast on a Sunday and had no problems being seated immediately. The wait staff was friendly and very attentive.  The food was good but not spectacular.  Of course it was all Vegas prices, so way more than one would spend for a similar meal elsewhere.",Good,,Good
"This is a nice, large American style restaurant that offers a wide variety of food all day long. We have only eaten breakfast there so I can only speak to that though. Breakfast prices are a little on the higher side but the portions are quite large. My omelet was so large that I could not finish all of it and it was very good. My only complaint would be the coffee. It was way to strong and expensive! They bring a small carafe to the table but it really only served the 2 of us a couple of very small cups and cost $7.95! Next time I will stick with water and buy coffee elsewhere. Lunch and dinner menu look good and prices seem fair. They do offer specials for both as well.",Good,Good,
Me and a friend went to sit at the bar and get a bite to eat 2 people behind bar less than 5 feet from us. Discussion there personal lives not caring about us after 10 minutes we got up and left.we were so disappointed we checked out of New York New York and went to mirage.,,Bad,Bad
"Had breakfast here on our last day, the steak was over cooked (burnt), prices were too high for what you get (Quality).
The waitress was not attentive and could not be found for most of the meal, despite being very slow. On the upside it is in the hotel and convenient.",Bad,Good,Bad
"Only went in for breakfast - drawn in by an all you can eat pancake offer - that was fine but otherwise the breakfast prices were eye wateringly expensive for relatively modest options like yogurt with granola, and regular coffee ... all served in gloomy atmosphere by semi competent wait staff. So I guess I am just another  naive tourist and victim of Las Vegas prices - l will know better next time.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The breakfast is still good and reasonable price since my last visit.....but sitting at bar for breakfast, missed the friendly serive from previous visits.   Will try again next time in Vegas, as it is good, and easy access for breakfast from casino....",Good,,Bad
"It‚Äôs my opinion that this place is similar to a Denny‚Äôs, with a unique atmosphere. Service and food was average, along with the price of the food.",Good,Good,Good
"Came here with wife last December, food was good.  This time back  we had our kids and went back because we needed a good breakfast option. However, while the food is good and reliable, it's hands down the worst coffee I've ever had  at a restaurant.  I had same experience last time. Honestly, how can a place make such a lousy coffee??",Good,Bad,
"We came here because it was reasonably priced food. It was definitely not amazing though. I had a sirloin, which I ordered medium but ended up getting a very rare steak. My wife got the chicken alfredo which was pretty bland and nothing special. Of course, drinks were not very reasonable there but I guess that's vegas for you.",Bad,,
"Solid choice for any meal any time of day.  Good, good quantity for average price.  Try to get the map of the USA in one shot, it's huge and cost 6 figures.",Good,Good,
"Well to put it into perspective, I forgot we are here on our last trip to Vegas!


Food was very basic and mass produced. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle was ok, but the chicken didn't even taste of anything! 


Service was pretty slow, didn't matter because we were not in a rush, but the waitress could have been a bit more pleasant!


All in all I would not recommend this restaurant",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had early breakfast at this ""diner"". I had breakfast burrito, which tasted ok. My wife had family farm Benedict and she liked it very much as well.


Unfortunately service was not so good. Our waitress was serving only two booths (located back-to-back) and most of the time she was standing behind us, talking loudly with the customers sitting on the other booth. This was a bit disturbing as we would have appreciated quietness.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Nice restaurant to just grab quick bite with kids
Otherwise nothing special..and the Confederate flag symbolizing Virginia. .seriously ?",,Bad,
Food was mass produced and lukewarm - management fobbed us off for the non delivery of our drink order and left it to our waiter to do the apologising - service was extremely slow,Bad,,Bad
"We called in here for brunch on the last day in Los Angles. The service was great & the meals over sized but tasty.


We had traditional pancakes with syrup & bacon and scrambled eggs, mushrooms were included on the menu but a request to leave them off was followed. I had my first ever bagel & cream cheese--- nice!!!!


The ambience was pleasant & ww would return for further meals had we found it earlier in our stay",Good,Good,Good
"My wife and I ate here while in Vegas on her birthday. I would say it was a mistake. I wish other reviewers had let me know this was basically a cafeteria with a menu and waitresses. I felt stupid for suggesting this place. Anyways we tried to make the best of it. We were well dressed and the waitress seated us at a normal table in the middle of a sea of normal tables pretty much next to a guy having breakfast with his wife at 6pm. I asked if we could have a booth but the waitress said that ""the manager didn't like seating people in that area"" um ok. So we moved towards the back of the ""restaurant"" where there were large wrap-around booths. Then my wife asked where the bathrooms were. Yeah they are outside the ""restaurant"". So my wife went, then I went and when I came back, the waitress had sat a noisy obnoxious foursome RIGHT next to us. They had a video chat with their kids right next to us during dinner. 


As for the food. We had some wings as appetizers and we asked for 1/2 mild and 1/2 hot sauces. Since it was a kitchen guy and not the waitress who delivered the food no one told us which wings were which and I doubt our request was even acknowledged. We then ordered some ribs, I'm not sure why we do this in places not known for ribs but we learned our lesson. The sauce was that horrible standard mesquite flavor, when the menu said bbq. While writing this I am dropping the rating because I guess I really didn't like this place. It turned us off sit-down restaurants for the rest of the trip.


Anyways the place has a huge map of America because, I guess we needed more reminding where we were. Pass on this place, unless you need to show American pride in the cafeteria's of America.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We arrived at the hotel rather late and we were quite hungry and this place was open.  The menu was pretty basic, think something like a Denny's but a little nicer.  It was a good value.",Good,,
"I ate here first night about 1:30 am, my burger was excellent. However the other people in my party were very disappointed; pancakes were dry not much flavor. The d√©cor of the place is cool and picture worthy. The servers were very nice and accommodating.",,Good,Good
"We ate here after gambling later at night as the restaurants were closed. Good bar food, TVs to watch sports, nice staff. Did not go for dinner just late night eats.",Good,Good,Good
Pretty boring and basic food. I ordered the turkey for lunch and it wasn't that great. The huge map on the ceiling is alot more interesting.,Bad,Good,
We decided to eat dinner on the last night of our holiday in the America restaurant. It was a really big restaurant with a huge 3D map on the ceiling. We went in at about 9.30 and the restaurant was virtually empty. Our waitress came over and was very friendly. We ordered our drinks and then she came back to take our order. We ordered cheese curds and mozzarella sticks for starters and I ordered the ribs and my husband ordered the chicken in a white wine sauce with pasta for main. The starters were really nice but we hadnt even had our plates taken away when the main courses were brought out.  We prefer to wait a while to let the starters go down first. We told the waitress who spoke to the manageress who came over and asked if we wanted anything and didn't even apologise for the mains coming out too quickly. So we told her again and the excuse was that the restaurant was empty so the chefs were cooking everything quickly and in the U.S. they like to eat more quickly!! There was obviously a lack of communication between waiting on staff and the kitchen and no apology. My husbands chicken was disgusting it was like rubber and he said it tasted funny so I told him not to eat it (didn't want him being ill on the flight home!) I tried cutting into it myself and the texture wasn't that of any chicken I have had before! My ribs were ok but had a lot of fat on them and they didn't fall off the bone like they should if cooked properly. The chips and corn were nice. We had really nice meals the rest of our holiday so this was a disappointing last meal in Vegas.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"Cool looking restaurant, but my omelet was bland with no taste. My wife's chicken and waffles wasn't much better. Expensive for breakfast too. Wouldn't really recommend.",Bad,Bad,
"middle of the road restaurant. Not too expensive and good for basic meals, nothing really fancy but very good and quick service.
Good for a family meal,",Good,Good,Good
Poor customer service sat us at the bar were we waited 10 minutes to be served food was average I don't think I would vivist here again,,Bad,Bad
"Went here for breakfast as we wanted a change from Buffet Breakfast. 
First of it only ended up about $5-10 cheaper than buffet and what we had would have been available in a buffet in:
 - unlimited amounts
 - better quality
 - In a nicer surrounding
 - with unlimited drinks


Id avoid, I really didnt want to give them my money, and we didnt eat everything.",Bad,Bad,
"America is nothing special, but it is not bad either. The menu is pretty standard fayre, burgers, fish and chips etc.The portion sizes are good and the food arrives hot, quickly. The service is very good,and the map of America that dominates the room will keep you mesmerised for a long while. Good for a quick, simple meal.",Good,Good,Good
While the food was up to expectations the service seemed a bit slow not the fault of the waitstaff maybe the kitchen was shortstaffed as the restaurant for breakfast was not busy at all.,Good,,Bad
"Nobody was ever eating there. We tried 2 different days. Stacy would NOT substitute the mixed veggies  for anything,NO rolls,No Bread,No SALAD  with the rib eye steak dinners....not very accommodatingat all. She was a little better than the waiter we had on 2/2/26/15 about 5pm...tall skinny Hispanic looking man,never came back to even ask if food was done or correct but came back to leave the bill at the end! NO personality on him,Not friendly. Stacy seemed like she came from another casino because she still seemed to be helpful and had a personality and smile. She said the hotel will NOT let her make any changes to the steak dinner since it was on a ""special"" (PHONEY SALE) I am sure.",Bad,,Bad
"Mac & cheese tastes like melted down plastic. Coffee was the most disgusting thing I have ever had. Tasteless, reheated food dressed up with huge portions. Servers never broke a smile once unless you are in a large group & they are after a big tip. Better choices elsewhere in the hotel or go across to Excalibur. Avoid Excalibur!!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Food was mediocre.  Had the ribs.  Way too much fat. Of the other food at the table, the fish and chips were so-so.  Chicken sandwich was good.  Granddaughter's mac n cheese was probably the best.  Too many other good places to choose from.",,Bad,
"Myself and my wife were here in October 2014, we decided we wouldnt come back here again , it was all just very average food and better options nearby",Bad,Bad,
My husband and I were so disappointed in the food here. We were staying at New York New York so we decided to try this restaurant and it turned out to be a mistake. The staff was great and the atmosphere but the food was just awful. We ordered a cheeseburger and turkey sandwich. The sandwich we had to send back. My husband thought the turkey tasted bad and I had the same opinion after trying it. He switched it out for a cheeseburger as well and it came out on the burnt side. My fries were on the soggy side. We won't be eating here again in the future.,Bad,Good,Good
"Loved the map on the ceiling of the different states and what you could see there, we waited an eternity for our food which when it came was ok but nothing special we didn't bother waiting around for dessert, it ok for a family but very basic we went because we thought it would be quick as it wasn't busy but we definitely made the wrong choice",Bad,Good,Bad
"Nice big restaurant with a good menu. The staff was super friends and the food was good quality with even better prices. Nothing exotic about it, but they don't claim to be fancy either. You will get some great solid American favorites any time of day or night at great prices here.",Good,Good,Good
The coffee here is not good and the baked goods were a little disappointing. Its okay if you need a quick fix donut but not if you're after a delectable baked delight.,Bad,,
"Beautiful topographical U.S.A. mural.  Omelettes were good.


Coffee was only warm & kind of weak. 


They have tvs to watch sports events.  We enjoyed watching the Badger game.",Good,Good,
"7am and needed breakfast. Tasted fine, traditional eggs, bacon, toast, etc. Big USA map in dining room is cool and a nice conversation piece. Only complaint - coffee was terrible. Very bland like dishwater. Come on folks! Make that coffee stronger!",Bad,Good,
Food is disappointing and the service is slow.  Overpriced for a club sandwich. We've tried it several times and it's sure nothing to rave about.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"We went looking for some variety and we found it here. There was a good selection of food, the portions were large and the flavor of the food was ""OK"". Just was typical for a ""diner setting"", the waitress was very accommodating.",Good,,Good
Restaurant was presented well. Loved the big map sculpture of the US. I had pancakes and they were quite dry ... only ate half - disappointing for me :-(,Bad,Good,
"Food was nothing special.  Atmosphere is drab, the map is kinda cool but nothing spectacular. Wait staff was attentive. Price was lower than most places in the area.",,,Good
"We ate Thanksgiving dinner there tonight. The appetizer came out with the entrees (odd). The waiter did not ask us for drink refills when he brought the food (We had to eat our dinner without drinks.) When he did come back to check on us we did manage to get some refills but he didn't clear any of the plates. We eventually stacked them up at the back of the table. (11 total) A manager came by and asked how our dinner was and we pointed to the stack of plates and she said ""Oh don't worry about it, just leave them."" The check for the two of us was $75 so we were obviously disappointed in the service. On the way out of the restaurant we saw another manager and I pointed to the tower of plates at our table. She said ""The server probably didn't know if you were done eating"". I asked her if she understood what pre-bussing was. She seemed confused by the question. America has lost our business after tonight.",,Bad,Bad
"Our server was the best! We were seated quickly and our server came over quickly.  Our food took awhile to get to us, and it wasn't as hot as it should be. We ordered sliders, and it was oblivious by the way the cheese looked they had been sitting awhile. The shrimp scampi was very nice. I had a steak and baked potato. It was tasty, but the potato was kind of small. Not what you would expect for the price. The restaurant has the huge hanging map - it was so much fun to look and talk about!",,Good,Good
"I had the breakfast. It was just OK.  The homefries were pretty greasy and the sausage is not the kind I am used to.  Spouse had the chicken, which he said was really good.  He didn't really like the stuffing or vegetables. Would probably try again, but order something different.",,,
Ok for a quick snack but the food and service was very average. It is a 24 hours place so perhaps we suffered from going late at night. As a cool map of America hanging from the ceiling which is worth a look at.,,Good,
They claim to have the best doughnuts - um no. Id rather eat 7 Eleven ones. The other deserts weren't bad - but everything tasted old.,Bad,,
Open 24 hours.  Good selection.  Try the America's Breakfast.  The cronuts at the America Bakery are divine.,Good,Good,
"America is a great dining option if you get very hungry late at night and crave for some comfort food.  We stayed in New York-New York where my husband was in conference.  He had a conference dinner in Scarpetta at the Cosmopolitan while I skipped dinner in NYNY.  So when he returned to NYNY, I was starving and thanks to America, they are a 24/7 restaurant right in the food court.  It must have been midnight and I had their prime rib special not normally on their regular menu.  It wasn't great but it wasn't bad at all and certainly took care of the hunger.  In the morning, I had their cronut which was pretty good although very bad for the waistline.  So, I say that although their food is pretty average, America in NYNY is a great dining option during unholy hours of the night.",,Good,
We were here at a dead time and expected the service to be a little quicker.  It wasn't.  Food was typical and nothing to brag about.   Too many other choices to merit a return trip,Bad,,Bad
"Ate here on my second night, the service was great but they got our order wrong somewhere between the waiter and the kitchen a pork chop and chicken became a pork chop and ribs!!  When I finally got my half a chicken it was dry there was no real sauce on either meal and overall it was bland.  However the waiting staff could not be more apologetic when we complained and what they did show that was true American was the Customer Service.",Bad,,Bad
"I went here specifically because I was having a craving for mac & cheese, and found them listed on a forum as a Vegas spot that features such a meal. Being that mac & cheese is a bit of a hobbyist niche specialty lately, I was expecting something interesting.


The service was great-- friendly, attentive and timely. The booth, however, was dirty. There was also food on the wall. The table itself was clean but the table topper/ad was dirty (see photo attached)


I've stayed at this hotel and hadn't eaten here, and am not staying there now but went back for a specific reason. 


The mac and cheese was nothing special... typical velveeta non powdered variety with a few shreds of other cheese to garnish. Taste was average and typical, not the tyipcal unique presentation that something as typical as mac & cheese gets-- like a white cheddar, baked, topped with cracker crumbs... nah. Just mac & cheese at $10 a plate, no sides.


I can't say there is a lot more to share about the experience other than the food I had was disappointing and the booth was dirty.",Bad,Bad,Good
"Slow service, overpriced food, which was not bad when it arrived.  I spent about 15dollars on a bowl of porridge, coffee, tax and a tip.  really bad value.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Had dinner here and a late night supper as its open 24 hours.  Waitress was very slow, food was basic standard burger nothing fancy.  The supper we took to our room and found it very slop[y I had pulled pork sandwich - yuk is all I'll say husbands burger not cooked through.  they have a varied menu but nothing to write home about",Bad,Bad,Bad
Not very expensive but the food wasn't spectacular.  I just wanted a late night snack and the menu was limited.  I probably wouldn't seek this place out again but there wasn't a whole lot of option.,Bad,Bad,
"We had pancakes for Breakfast. Very large portions, but not so tasty. Nice decor on the walls. Big place, impersonal, loud noice. We didn't want to return.",Bad,Bad,
Wanted to eat at this restaurant for a while but always ended up eating elsewhere.  We saw the steak special they were having and decided to try it.  My husband had the special and I had the chipotle chicken wrap.  Mistake on both counts.  My husband asked for his steak cooked medium well and it was burnt on the bottom.  My wrap had very little Chipotle on it so I had to ask for extra.  Really disappointed and will not go back,Bad,Bad,
We've been here a couple times for breakfast and it's about average. The food is consistently good. You can usually get a table pretty quickly and we've always had Good here. If you are staying at NY NY and need a quick breakfast and don't want to deal with lines at a buffet then this is your place!,Good,Good,Good
"My friends and I decided to dine here for a late night/early morning snack. The food was just ok, nothing spectacular. It was more like what I expect from a sportster rather than a casino restaurant. I would not recommend it if you are craving original and unique flavors. That all being said, the service was very good. The bartender was very attentive and offered to comp our meals since we did not eat much of them.",,,Good
The choices here are great but found it to be very pricey for what you got and pretty bland food. I think there are better choices in the hotel for your money,Bad,,
"We were drawn to this restaurant based on other reviews but unfortunately it was a terrible experience.  The restaurant was practically empty and completely void of atmosphere.  There was no music or anything, just a nice map of the USA on the ceiling to stare at.


I ordered a half-rack of ribs and sent them back within a minute of them arriving.  They were impossible to cut into and full of fat and gristle.  Having lost my appetite by that point, I opted for a bowl of soup which was tasty enough but not exactly first choice.


Our waitress was pleasant enough but even she agreed that the ribs were rank.  All in all, this was a waste of an evening meal during our short visit to Vegas.  There is much better food to be had elsewhere in my opinion.",Bad,Bad,Good
"Service was lacklustre, it was quiet so it would have been nice if the waiter could have been a bit more attentive.  Cocktails were colourful but a little bland tasting.  The club sandwich was very tasty, though, and they were very nice about boxing up the left overs for me (it was huge and I hate to waste food!).  I'd visit again, as it was a reasonable lunch.",Good,,Bad
I liked the d√©cor - the map of the USA on the roof is really neat to see...gives you something to look at; talk about while you wait for your food...not to mean it takes a long time to be served...the service was fine.  Dishes offered are standard comfort foods.  They serve up a decent breakfast for a fair price if you can't handle a buffet.,Good,Good,Good
"I thought it was ok, standard food although quite pricey for the standard you get. There are better places outside of the hotel nyny just up the strip",,,
"We have breakfast at this restaurant, the food is average pancake, eggs etc, but attracted our attention are the fun giant 50 maps hang in all over the restaurant, while we all waiting for our foods, good time to walk around take some pictures as they are very unique and attractive.",,Good,
"There are so many places to dine in Vegas, but if you're looking for something that's easy on the wallet this is a good choice.  The service was great but the food was just so-so.  Kind of like a Perkins or a Denny's.  When there are so many places to go in Vegas, I would suggest being a bit more adventurous.",Good,,Good
"Walking around in the area of the New York New York hotel as part of our explorations of the Strip hotels and felt the need for a typical eggs-and-bacon type of breakfast. I remembered reading about this in my trip planning research so we stopped in.  It was an in-between time in the middle of breakfast and lunch so the place was empty - found seat quickly and service was prompt.  Prices very reasonable (for Vegas) and hit the spot with what we were needing at the time -- coffee, juice, eggs and the like.  Server was quick and pleasant.  Very casual place - not quite the diner-looking atmosphere, but the menu is similar to one.  Sort of a cafeteria type of feel, very family-appropriate if you have your kids with you (we didn't).   Big ""America"" artwork/mural on the ceiling is fun to view while waiting for food.  In - eat - out.  No fuss, no muss.",Good,Good,Good
"Well, mixed feelings. Positives, no queue, easy and Good. Traditional american diner menu. Teenagers found their favorites and were Happy. Room for improvement: Appetizers shared buffalo wings were not crispy, no wet towel offered after messy finger food. My ribs appeared to be industrial grade and the heating process failed big this time, do not recommend for ribs lovers. I tried both Kendall Jackson chardonnay and cabernet by the glass, and were charged accordingly; either the wines were not in their best shape or I  was served the cheaper options (I do know my wines as blind). As advertized, this is casual not fine dining.",Bad,,Good
We stopped in for dessert which was just okay but the service was horrible.  I would not go back.  We only had ice cream desserts but we all were not feeling well after eating them.  I would not recommend!,Bad,Bad,Bad
"We had breakfast one morning of our stay.  While the service was good and the waiter friendly, the food was way too expensive for what it was.  I had an omelet that had very little filling and they hid the fact that it was over cooked by hiding it on the inside of the omelet.",Bad,,Good
It is open 24 hours and it was OK.  It was better the what I thought be it was very expensive for the quality.  I ate here once for breakfast and once late at night because nothing else was open.   They have a full bar but I was still surprised a lot of tables were ordering beer and spirits.  Must have won big at the tables because the beer is very expensive here.  I ordered a hamburger late at night and it was better then expected.,Good,,
"Very poor service by total incompetence . Waited 45mins for a gluten free burger and my friend for a steak salad at 11pm at night with only 10 people in the restaurant. Bottom line they made an pigs ear of it.  Asked after 25mins what had happened to our order and they said its next out.  After 40 mins still nothing. So asked again. Only now they say oh we have a problem we don't have a gluten free bun.  Which would be fine if they had told us at start but got better. Then said oh we do have it but it's frozen and hasn't thawed out haha. Unreal. Wanted then after all this to serve the burger inside lettuce but I said no taken too long. Said they must get manager , another 5 mins go by cause they couldn't find him so we walked out , they didn't even see us leave.  Total joke I'm afraid",,Bad,Bad
"We ate here twice during our weeklong stay. The Wisconsin cheddar omelet was nothing more than ordinary. But the fruit-and-granola parfait was very tasty. And when you order a side of bacon, you get six full strips - a great value.",Good,,
They advertise a sirloin and crab legs dinner for 14.99. When we got there they had changed the special to Filet Mignon and lobster tail. Not bad until I got the dry lobster tail and well done filet I ordered Med. rare. It took over 20 mins to get the filet back while I ate my Lobster and rest of pot/veg got cold. Not even my glass of wine free.. My husband got the chicken parm. just ok...would not recommend.,Bad,Bad,Bad
America was pretty slow both times that we ate there--once for lunch and a second time for breakfast. The food is nothing spectacular and the drinks were meh. The prices were similar to an Applebees.,Bad,,Bad
"We ate here our first night and didn't feel the need to return for any reason.  I found the staff a little unfriendly.  The meal was average, price was a little above average, but anywhere on the strip is expensive.  I didn't try the pastry though it looked good.",Bad,Bad,Bad
The spaghetti was just OK and the burger my brother got was very bland ..Over priced and wouldn't go back. The only thing that was good was the waiter...,Bad,Bad,Good
It's like Denny's. The food was decidedly average and we waited a long time for our food despite there being almost nobody in the restaurant. So many better places to eat in Vegas.,Good,Bad,Bad
"Food options plenty, kinda pricey for what you get. Food was good, service was average. Don't avoid it, but there are better options.",Good,,
"We stayed at NYNY and passed America Restaurant daily, so we decided to give it a shot one night after walking the Strip all day. The restaurant was empty and the map of the US was the only decoration the place had. Two members of our party ordered the crab legs and steak, one ordered a cheeseburger, and I ordered chicken alfredo. Everyone enjoyed their food- big portions and decent service. We thought we had a good meal... Until the next morning. I have been sick in bed in horrid pain for the past two days after eating at America. Two days of my Vegas vacation have been wasted because of the restaurants' poor handling of food. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.",Bad,Bad,
"Our family went to this place because many said that the food is good and inexpensive. This was not the case. My steak and my Alfredo had no taste. One of my family members ordered a rack of ribs and the sauce was warm but the ribs were cold. The cheese cake taste as if it were sitting out for days. The restaurant was empty yet it took almost an hour to get our food. I order a salad and I didn't get it until after my entree, I had to remind the waitress about my salad. I was displeased with the service and food. I will not be eating here again.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We ate at AMERICA. The food was just standard food. 


The service was good & we LOVED the giant map of the United States hanging above as, as well as the giant postcards. 


We probably won't return, but I'd tell people to try it out if they are in the NYNY Hotel & Casino.",Good,Good,Good
"We had lunch there. The Cobb salad was awesome. The prices were about average for Vegas. It was lunch time a salad, blt, hamburger,1 tea and 3 cups of coffee was $60 with 18%tip",Good,,
"We ate breakfast here this morning. 
I had the eggs benedict which tasted overly of vinegar but other than that were okay.
My husband had the pancakes. The first one he tried to eat was so hard and dry that it crumbled. The next one was completely burned.
Overall a poor experience.",Bad,Bad,
"The food we had was nice enough but can't say it was the best place to eat in Vegas, but it was nice!


There is plenty choice on the menu and the giant 3D map of America on the ceiling is definitely worth seeing! The fact that it's open 24 hours would be useful for some people I would imagine ;)",Good,Good,
"1. My sister's review:  we should have eaten here every single day.  Steak and crab for $13! OMG
2. My review: meh. Yes, they have steak and crab for $13, but everything else on the menu was over priced. I ordered the steak and crab and I don't even eat crab. Then when it came out, all my food was SOAKED in  crab juice, and each bite came with a side of vomit as my mouth tried to reject it. Steak, vegetables, baked potato, it was all disgusting. How long does a set of crab legs have to sit on top of a plate of food for that to happen?  I ate NOTHING. 
Good luck! haha",Bad,,
Love the decor but the meal was just ok.  It was nothing spectacular about it other than the map decor of north america.  Servers were fine.  We had an early breakfast after gambling.  we ordered their pancakes which is a morning special along with eggs and sausage.  My husband did not like the pancake syrup at all while to me it seemed typical.  I would do again but probably not breakfast.,,Good,Good
"Never again, way too much money for a less than mediocre breakfast. they don't know how to make a decent capuchino nor espresso, for me it's the most important thing for breakfast.
Button line, over priced , slow service and less than mediocre food. Like the holocaust, NEVER AGAIN!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Nice 24 hour restaurant inside the NYNY. Nothing special as far as food goes, but it gets the job done.  I had the Meatball sub.  The meatballs were actually pretty good, but the sauce was very bland.  My wife had the steak special.  Her steak was also very bland, but what do you expect for a huge $12 steak in vegas.  We also shared some chicken wings, which had pretty good flavor but were small wings.  Overall, I would say that this place is definitely not a ""must do"" in Vegas, but if you are wandering around hungry near the NYNY around 2-3am when most other places are closed, this place will fill you up.",Good,Good,
"We visited America at New York New York for breakfast based on a other trip advisor reviews, and because we wanted to check out the hotel as well.  The donuts at the front counter really should be illegal - they are HUGE!  We didn't have any, we were more interested in eggs.  I had the ABC omelet and my partner had the traditional breakfast (eggs, meat, potatoes, toast).  My omelet was quite tasty.  I didn't like the potatoes at all (thin potato slices that have been deep fried) but it may have been because they were cold.  The toast was like a raft.  It was a $40 meal, which I didn't think was worth it.",Bad,,
"Avoid the America Cafe in New York, New York at all costs. In a word-lousy. There were 8 of us eating there for breakfast and none of us were pleased. Now, I realize that large groups can cause problems, but if you cannot handle it, get rid of the big tables. End of excuses. I ordered soft, I repeat soft, poached eggs with rye toast and bacon. The bacon strips were edible. The soft poached eggs were actually hard-boiled and sitting in a dish of water. The bread for the toast had to have been stale, since when one took a bite of the toast, it crumbled apart. Coffee was weak. Enough said.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We went for breakfast and it was a disaster!
The waitress argued over taking the order wrong...ordered blueberry pancakes and received waffles with blueberries on the side instead!
The coffee is the worst
The food was bland
The bill was wrong when it arrived and it took 3 attempts to get it corrected
Denny's is 5 minutes walk over the Strip the service is superior and so is the food...and it's better value too! Take the trip",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This restaruants service was less than adequate. We went in late night for breakfast and they only offered like four things and wouldn't sway a bit, so we could just simply get eggs and sausage, pot and tst. Slow service both by waiter and getting the food. Tried it a second time at a different time of day, service still poor and slow food preparation.",,Bad,Bad
"The food and coffee in this place for take out was great. I went here three or four times over a four day stay in the casino.The donuts are very good. The people serving at the front are friendly, polite and helpful. One night we came in Late for a sit down drink and snack. The food was pretty good, the waiter was good at suggesting things for us to have, although probably tried to upsell more than we were happy with. I think I mad some sort of faux pah with the tipping. I am not sure how it is meant to be done. Anyway, I always intended to five a proper 20 to 25 per cent tip, but maybe did not make it clear that was my intention in handing over the money for the meal. Anyway, loud comments appeared to be exchanged between the waiter and the lady who was possibly the waiter's supervisor, about the lack of tip. This stopped us from returning to the place. If you work in Vegas you should be more patient with foreigners who don't know the right way to go about tipping and not make them feel like they are horrible people when they are trying to do the right thing.",Good,Bad,Bad
"If you are staying at NY NY make sure you check out America. We ate here at breakfast and eve meal service depends on who you get for your server, some mornings were excellent some mornings service was not so fast. Breakfast was reasonable with a good choice of food and saved walking out to the strip to get breakfast. Evening meals were average however my husband had steak one night which was fab! If your looking for food within the hotel this is the place to be.",Good,Good,
"The title pretty much sums our experience up. The food was fantastic and the milkshakes even better. The only let down was the waiter. He took an age to take our drinks order despite it being pretty quiet in the restaurant. He brought our meals out at different times, about 10 mins between the first and last. (4 total) Then came over halfway through our meal to ask for his tip as his shift was ending. 


Convenient if you're in NYNY but otherwise I wouldn't bother.",Good,,Bad
"Had breakfast and lunch here.  Pretty standard fare, nothing special even though the menu is extensive. Service was lacklustre and prices commensurate with amount of food, so fair value.  The biggest plus is its open 24/7.",Good,,Bad
"nice place with Good, the food is quick but i expected it to be better to show case the dining in the USA. it didnt fail but it didnt pass either. thank god for te staff, they were friendly and helpful and made you actually feel welcome. aftre having read the reviews on here i thought aftre my first visit maybe they just had an off day with the ribs i ordered being a little tough, so i gave them another chance a few days later, service was still as good but the ribs were the same, so i was a little disapointed.",Good,,Good
"I only ever eat in here whilst sat at the bar, but the service was friendly and the food portions were giant. Definitely incredibly value for money if not the best restaurant I eat in the time I was at the New York New York.",Good,,Good
"ordered simole dinners and they came have cooked, staff ignored everyone and the waitors where terrible. only nice nice person was the host who seated us.",,Bad,Bad
We tried to eat there and ordered fish and chips and an American burger well done.  After 25 minutes and noticing that other people around us had been served (and some had been served a second course) when the waiter asked my husband if he would like another beer we said no but food would be good.  His reply was that it took longer to cook a well done burger!  He then brought us four bread rolls.  After another 10 minutes we again asked him where our food was as we noticed that a party of 6 who came well after us were being served their meals.  We called the waiter over  and cancelled our food order.  We have been travelling around America for four weeks now and this is the worst service we have encountered on our travels!,,Bad,Bad
Had Eggs Benny and coffee one morning...both were awful. I am writing this sentence because I'm not allowed less than 50 characters.,Bad,,
"If we could, we would rate at ZERO.  The restaurant was almost empty at lunch time and should have been an indicator of poor food.  The waitress walked up from behind us and said...""what is your drink order?""  NO greeting at all.  When she came back with drinks, the only words stated were ""what are you ordering?""  We should have left then.  We ordered, then waited, waited and waited.  Never saw the waitress again for any tables.  We complained of lack of attention and then several staff attempted to advise us that the computer was the problem.  Never apologized for the lack of attention or service from waitress.  We left without eating.  Go to DELI for sandwich.....great food, great service without all the drama.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Only ate here once for breakfast, service could have been a bit better but wasn't totally bad either....just ok.  Food was just ok as well....ordered Ham & Eggs with toast....Ham was a tad salty, eggs nicely poached, toast was way underdone.",,,
"Not much too say. Cold French toast weak coffee and slow inattentive service.  Diverse menu.  Sometimes the food is okay - usually not.  The one constant over my three visits is the cold, impersonal, slow service.",Bad,,Bad
Specials are priced right when taste buds have succumbed to the alcohol served by the casinos. Also because so much money was lost to said casinos price was just right. Nice and accommodating staff. Would go back.,Good,Good,Good
"The huge USA Map hanging from the ceiling was the highlight. If that's the best thing to say about a restaurant it was not good. It is a large restaurant. Quiet, off the beaten path. The food was ok, the service was mediocre. The waiter was friendly but messed up the order. The bus boy only spoke Spanish so it was difficult to converse. I wouldn't go back there.",,Good,Bad
"Overall, the food was below average, had to send back the steak and eggs, toast was like a giant crouton, steak way overdone on first try.  Second time we go there the eggs looked like they were left sitting there for a while as they were rubbery and not cooked properly.  When they tried again, it took so long to get the second set out it really was too late.  


I will say they did make sure to take the offending dish off the bill and on the second bad breakfast they brought out a fruit tray as well to make up for it.  So, the staff did their best to make up for it and I'll give them that, but 2 strikes and I'm not sure I'm stepping up to bat again.  


Place was expensive, even with a meal taken off of the bill each time the bill was still $30.  I mean, $30 for 1 breakfast with a couple of drinks like coffee and tea, that's expensive even for the new Vegas.",Bad,,Good
The food is good and the prices are reasonable for a Las Vegas restaurant.  We stopped for what was supposed to be a quick lunch.  The wait staff was nice but the long time between placing our order and having it served was unacceptable.  I could have eaten at a fast food restaurant and done just as well.,Good,,Good
Im sorry but the service was lazy around lunch time. its a place for people have gambled all night long and just needs to eat something! LOL. I had the chicken fried steak and it was horrible.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"The food was average, the service was good. I would recommend this for a quick bite for families. The place is big and the food was reasonable for Vegas.",Good,Good,Good
"The service I received at this restaurant was heads-and-shoulders above the service of the Hotel staff, but they set a very low bar. My water was refilled and the server stopped by often (not too often) both times I ate here.


The first visit I had a fruit plate, which was above average. On that meal alone I would have rated America a 4, but the second meal was a breakfast and I was disappointed. The toast and potatoes were only slightly above room temperature. The eggs were good, but could have been hotter. The sausage was sub-par. If you're a coffee snob, go elsewhere. America's coffee is not good - I've had better at dives with $5 breakfasts.


In looking at the reviews of this place, it becomes obvious that the quality is all over the place. But hey, it's Vegas. Roll the dice and take your chances. Maybe your meal will be incredible.",Bad,,Good
"We met friends here at about 9:30 p.m. for a late meal/snack. I was going to order the tiramisu but the waiter thought it might be difficult to get that at that hour so 3 of us elected to try the biscuits and gravy. Being midwesterners, we are picky about our B&G. This wasn't typical--we usually have crumbled sausage through the gravy, and this was litlle chopped up pieces of some kind of link sausage, almost like ham in the gravy. Just a little weird, but didn't taste bad. Service was a little slow given the lateness of the hour. One of our other friends recommends the omelet.",Good,,Bad
"My girlfriend and I went there to a dinner before we went to see KA. The service was horrible, there were only 10 people in the restaurant arty the time and the server was rude and other severs were bringing our drinks and food to us, and there were three other servers just standing at the front counter not serving any of the other customers. It took a while for the server to come back out when we wanted to order something else.",,Bad,Bad
"Ate here late night and the service was very slow and the waiter didn't seem to have any sense of urgency or concern that we had been waiting nearly 30 minutes for food when the restaurant was barely 1/4 full. Once the food arrived it was edible, but not delicious. Only ate here once during our stay. If I stay at NY NY again, I won't be dining here.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"After many flight delays we arrived into Vegas 7 hours later than expected.  We were beat and decided to eat here based on the proximity to our beds.  The service was mediocre, but the food was big portions, hot and tasty!",Good,,
"Prices were reasonable, but you get what you pay for.  Slow service on a Saturday night despite a mostly empty restaurant. We were a party of 13, but if you set the party size aside the flavor of the food was underwhelming.  If you've come this far (to Vegas), eat someplace that prepares better food, or has a more special/memorable atmosphere.",Bad,Bad,Bad
We ate here very late because it was the only place open in NYNY.  We were hungry but wanted to share a meal before going to sleep.  The portion was small for the price and not very tasty.  Service was slow and meal tasted left over and barely warm.  Decided it was not worth a second try.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"My husband's omelette was very good.  He had the Swiss cheese and mushroom.  The potatoes were fine.  I had the yogurt, fruit and granola.  The only fruit was a sliced strawberry - one strawberry.  It should have been called yogurt and granola because one sliced strawberry is merely garnish.  The hot chocolate was excellent.  The service was good.  Expensive for what we received.",Good,,Good
"The portion size was good and the selection was good. Typical Vegas cafe type restaurant. I would of liked the walk up bakery portion of the restaurant opened later in the evening. However, you can still get some dessert if you go in and sit down.",Good,,
"What was delivered was not what we expected. 


The service was so,so but the quality of food was very poor.  There were four adults in our party and no one of us had a decent meal (we all chose different dishes).  


Would not go here again and could not recommend to anyone.",Bad,Bad,
"Nothing special. Typical dive restaurant tasting food. They did have a late day special of steak, some crab legs, potato, and a choice of soup or salad for $15. Will eat there again for that special.",Good,Good,
"The menu here was very extensive with plenty to choose from. We had hamburger, nachos, and pizza. It was very filling and plenty to eat for the price. Unfortunately for me, it was just average. We chose this place because of the price and did not get anything above what we expected. Service was good and the motif great. The table contained some US trivia which was great to pass the time. The place is huge and only had a few people dining which should have been a clue for us.",Good,Good,Good
"We stopped by America looking for a late breakfast.  According to the sign posted outside, breakfast was served until 12:00 however that was not the case, and they switched to the limited breakfast menu at 11:30.  


We really wanted breakfast so we ordered.  The food was ok but with all Casino restaurants on the strip it was over priced.  


We went back to America after a show for a late night treat from the doughnut counter.  All I can say is wonderful.  Skip the late breakfast menu and get there early enough for the full breakfast menu, and if you get there late stick to the doughnuts.",Good,,
"We've visited America several times over the years, and it just isn't as good as it used to be.


We had breakfast there this trip and, while the food and service were good/adequate, we found $37 for two breakfasts (bacon & eggs/waffle & bacon, plus sodas) to be a bit on the expensive side.",Good,Bad,Good
"There are many food options....which is too bad since they can't seem to get any of them right. The food was very average and totally forgettable. Pizza was soggy, pasta was very plain (both spaghetti and shrimp version). 


The worst part was the service. Some people waited so long they just left. To get the bill, pay and get change back literally took 35 mins!?!! Wish we just grabbed something else.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We purchased doughnuts and coffee at this joint in NYNY every night because the doughnuts were good and the coffee was OK.  That being said I was turned off by the night counter woman who couldn't tell me what was in the filled doughnuts. When I asked the response was ""I dunno, I just sell em.""  At $3.00 per doughnut I expect the help to be able to tell me what they're selling!!",Good,,Bad
This restaurant provides a good value for ok food.  We had dinner here the night we arrived and my friends enjoyed the steak with crab legs meal for $14.95.  I had pasta dish that was also ok.  We also had breakfast here the morning we checked out and the food was fine.  It`s a big restaurant and the map of America is pretty cool to look at.  If I stayed in New York New York again I`d probably eat here again for a late night meal or breakfast on the way out.,Good,Good,
"America is an ok stop in NYNY if you are hard pressed to find a restaurant that has room.  The food isn't bad and there is a lot of it, but the service is not professional and the restaurant is not that clean.  
The portions are enormous; we could have easily shared a meal as we left about half on our plates.  
We wouldn't eat here again.",Good,Bad,Bad
"This is the 5th or so time I've eaten at this restaurant.  The food has varied from very good to 'okay'.  We had breakfast here on 5 July and was seated right away.  We informed the cheery hostess that we wanted a booth and that seemed to damper her mood.  She sat us in a booth close to the hostess station.  And there we sat for a good 15 minutes before our server came over.  The server asked us if we wanted coffee and we said yes.  Before we could order our waters or some OJ, she was off.  5 minutes later she came back with our coffee.  I ordered some OJ, water and then we told her we wanted to place our order.  She was rude, cut me off after asking me what I wanted and seemed to want to rush us through the order.  And then she was off again.  Another 5 minutes pass as we get our much needed waters along with the OJ.  Before we could ask for straws, she was off again, never to be seen until we asked for the check.  


Some other guy who seemed like he hated his job, delivered our food.  My husband got up to ask a random employee for straws and our water glasses were empty long before the meal was over.  I left the booth and my husband spoke to the waitress, told her the service was the worse, and left her a zero tip.  She apologized and took the OJs/coffee off the bill (which didn't make a difference to us).  So unfortunately, unless we are sitting at the bar we will not return to this restaurant due to poor service. 


The food is pretty good though so if you don't mind horrible service then definitely give this place a try (the mac n cheese is to die for!).  This was just our last straw for us as we've had Bad over half the times we've been here.",Good,Bad,Bad
"the service was very slow, the food was not that great for a ""new york"" restaurant.  didnt like the ambiance other than the super large map of the US.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We ate breakfast at America after having missed the breakfast times at the other New York, New York restaurants.  The server was very friendly, the food arrived quickly, and our omelets were very delicious.  I had an egg white omelet which was filled with all kinds of vegetables, including artichokes.  While many of the New York, New York restaurants close in the late evening, America offers sandwiches and dinners round the clock.",Good,Good,Good
"It was 5 of us. They have specials daily that are cheap. The special we got was steak and crab legs for $14.99...It was cheap and tasted good for the price. They are generious with the portions as well. The food took longer than it should, considering was not a busy night but I could see our waitress working very hard for tips. 
Food - Good
If you have a large group or family, this is a good restaurant to try.",Good,,Good
We ate here our first morning in Vegas after seeing a sign for all you can eat pancakes outside the night before.  When we arrived at 930am there was no such offer any more. We were seated under the map-which was cool- but then we were ignored for the next 10 mins. When the waitress finally appeared it seemed as though she had just come off a night-long bender and coudln't care less about serving us or getting a tip apparently. I ordered the blueberry pancakes and my husband got the Eggs Benedict. to my surprise the pancakes came out -not filled with blueberries- but just regular pancakes with some blueberries scattered on top. After 5 mins of waiting to for someone to pass us I caught our waitress (Who hadn't delivered the meal itself and had yet to check on us) and explained that I was expecting pancakes that actually contained berries- not just a few sitting on top. she said she could get something else- but otherwise didn't care that i was not happy. I  asked for a simple egg and toast instead.  My husbands eggs were not runny as is the usual with benedict- but cooked through and dry. It was a horrible experiece for our first morning - and we did not go back there again- and we don't recommend at all!,Bad,Bad,Bad
We ate at this location one morning cause it was convenient for us seems how we were staying at the New York New York casino.  There was nothing special about the food.  The portions were not very big for the pricing.  Our server Mary was a good server though.  The d√©cor does seem to need a bit of updating.  Do not try the pastries that they sell outside of the restaurant.  My husband and daughter both had one each ( totally different) and they said they were hard and dried out.  I'm glad I decided to skip them. For the pricing you would be better off going to a breakfast buffet for a variety and probably better food.,Bad,Bad,Good
"I had high hopes for America being that it is located in NYNY which is my favourite hotel in Las Vegas however I found the food to be overpriced and disappointing. I can make a better stack of pancakes myself! And it certainly won't cost me $20 with an orange juice at $4!


The staff were not rude but they weren't overly friendly either and there was absolutely no atmosphere at all.


The food wasn't terrible but I expected a lot more from the place. I wouldn't go here again.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"My buddy and I ate at America last year and had a great steak and crab leg special. This year I went with my wife and they had the same special advertised. It was supposed to be available from 3 to 11.  We went to eat at 6 and they were out of crab legs.  We decided we would try again the next night.  I called ahead to make sure they had crab legs and was told they did. We were seated and when we ordered the waiter said they were out of crab legs.  His pathetic excuse was that the manager had not ordered enough for the second day in a row, because he had not predicted the amount of business they would have.  This place is a waste of time and very poorly run, avoid it!",,Bad,Bad
"We went here for the convenience of it after a long day of walking up & down the strip. The food seemed like it was made somewhere else & bought to you with a aluminium lid on it (similar to room service) it took a while to get the food. I had pasta which was very dull, no taste & not offered Parmesan cheese. I ended up flooding it with salt & pepper to get some taste. My daughter had pizza which was like cardboard didn't even eat half of it which is unusual.
Wouldn't recommend",Bad,Bad,
Once again service was average and took almost 30 minutes to get our order. I must say the food was hot when we did receive it but don't care to wait that long.,Good,,Bad
"As we were staying at New York-New York, we thought, to make the first night easy while we got our bearings, we would eat in.  I had shrimp with angel hair pasta and my wife had Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken.  To be fair, the shrimp was nice but the sauce in the pasta was too thin for my liking.  My wife‚Äôs chicken was a bit bland; she felt that some parmesan might have improved it, but none was offered.  For a one course meal and 2 glasses of red wine it was about $50.  I wouldn‚Äôt have minded paying this if it had been good but it was, as captioned, pretty mediocre.",Bad,Bad,
The breakfast was mediocre at best. The hash browns were obviously frozen and barely warmed up. Would not eat here again.,Bad,Bad,
"Good place for family style meals.  Also has a bar area with sports on TVs where you can order food as well. 


Well priced. I had a nice salmon salad and two glasses of wine plus tip for approx. $30.00.",Good,,
"The best thing about it is that it is open till late and opens early in the morning so after a late gambling stint or an early rise, it is open for service. We had breakfast here two or three times and it was ok, nothing special. The prices are reasonable.",Good,,
We've been here before and it's hit or miss on the food.  Last year they messed up pasta orders! Hubby ordered bratwurst-all out!  I ordered a burger med rare-it came and was in two pieces-opened bun-top half burnt-turned over and bottom looked liked half was left on grill.  So for our inconvience we'll give you free donuts!  But they had been there since breakfast on open trays as you enter! Stale!!,Bad,Bad,
"The America Caf√© is located in the New York New York Hotel & Casino and is the only restaurant in the hotel that never closes.  It offers an extensive variety of diner/bar food that includes appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pastas, limited entr√©es, and a few breakfast items.  It has a big dining room with a large bar and the d√©cor is unremarkable except for the huge map of the USA on its ceiling.
 
My wife and I stopped there around midnight after a late show for a light bite.  The place had few patrons and we sat at the bar.  Our female bartender was amicable and poured each of us a good drink.  My wife and I shared a triple-decker club sandwich and a side of French fries.  The sandwich was tasty and the fries were hot and flavorful.  The food and drinks hit the spot and nicely satisfied our late hour cravings. 


The America Caf√© is recommended for providing a convenient, simple meal at a late hour.",Good,Good,Good
"I know American food is not very well known for its quality but you will not find any pieces of ""cooking food"" here... Only fat bacon and fat juicy burgers (I know... sounds good like that but trust me it's not). Waitress are as kind and pleasant as a jail door (as we say in my city) and the decoration does not deserve better (except the outstanding work on the huge map... but that's all!).


Not enough for an hotel based on New-York city...",Bad,Bad,Bad
"The service was slow and slightly rude, the food was average, but the scenery was great. Very cool restaurant inside.",,Good,Bad
Food was very good for breakfast but didn't care for the dinner as much. Could have been the ribs and chicken we had because the sauce was not that good. Salads were fine but the total bill was more than we wanted spend.,Bad,,
Nice and clean. Had breakfast and it was good. Price was fair and service was pleasant.  Would eat there again.,Good,Good,Good
"Got seated quickly but then it was nit or miss.  First time was a little slow in taking our order.  Food was just good.  Reasonable price.  Second time we were seated, waited for 15 min. without being acknowledged then left.  Made sure to tell hostess on the way out why we left but she didn't seem interested.",Good,,Bad
"There was a group of us who stayed at the New York New York hotel. Included in our package was breakfast in the America restaurant. The breakfast voucher entitled us to tea/coffee, eggs, bacon/sausage and a hash brown. The food was very greasy and I was not the only one to comment on that. The food was ok but maybe too greasy for alot of people. I probably would not visit this restaurant again if i returned to the New York New York hotel.",Bad,Bad,
"The service was great, but the food was average. Typical Vegas restaurant, herd in and herd out. We were hoping for more.",Bad,,Good
"While staying at the NY, we stopped in here for a quick meal because we had a busy day planned and were hoping that eating ‚Äúin-house‚Äù would save us time. What a mistake.


The restaurant was no more than one-third full. There were many empty tables, yet we waited more than 30 minutes for our salads. Food finally came out pretty soon after we finally were able to catch the attention of our waitress and ask her to check on the progress of our order.


My Chinese Chicken Salad was terribly disappointing. I was looking for something a little healthier after days of eating fattening Vegas food. The ‚Äústrips of chicken breast‚Äù on the salad turned out to be breaded and fried chicken strips, the same thing you would expect to get in a kids‚Äô meal at a fast food place. They were badly overcooked, dry and unappetizing. By the way, this is exactly the same salad description that is shown on the room service menu, so whether in the restaurant or in-room dining, don‚Äôt expect anything healthy or special.


The menu description was misleading. My husband‚Äôs salad was supposed to have cherry tomatoes‚Äîthere were none. Likewise my salad did not have any sesame seeds, and only one or two tiny slivers of almonds, that were in the description of the dish. At least the greens in both salads were fresh.


The point is, don‚Äôt expect to get anything special here. With the very slow service, we ended up wasting a lot of time here for a disappointing, poor quality meal.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Had breakfast here and it was two runny over easy eggs, a small amount of hashbrowns, and funny tasting sausage.  The best part was the toast.",Good,,
The decor is nice and interesting with a great mural of America that covers the ceiling - we spent a while just looking at that.  But the food was Denny's level at best.  I ordered 2 eggs and a Bagel and coffee.  My son ordered a very small omelet and mile and my husband ordered a belgian waffle and coffee.  Our bill was a staggering $50!!!  They have some really pretty donuts in the window too.  I didn't eat one but my niece said they tasted like they had been there for days and Dunkin Donuts has nothing to be concerned about!  She said they were very very dry and cost $2.50 each.  Was not impressed at all.,Bad,Good,
"Food was not very good. Had a late night dinner so steak and crab legs. Legs ok, steak was tough. Service was friendly",Bad,,Good
"We stayed in the New York, New York hotel for a couple of nights and ate in America twice; once for dinner and once for breakfast.  The food, service and price were ""Average"".  Nothing to complain about, nothing to write home about.  For the price, as you would expect.  Not sure that I would ""recommend"" America as a dining experience, but also wouldn't discourage anyone from going.",Good,Bad,
"We had breakfast here at America.  It was just OK.  The coffee is pretty much like burnt mud.  You would think with the amount of people being served, they would have fresh coffee.  My husband ordered bacon and eggs and got sausage.  The server seemed annoyed that he didn't want to just keep the sausage.  I had a western omelette that was just ok, nothing great.  The hashbrowns just tasted like burnt starch. The whole wheat toast looked and tasted like cheap bread.  When our friend joined us a little after we got there, the server once again seemed annoyed.  It was edible but will not being eating here on our next Vegas trip.",Good,,Bad
"We decided to eat breakfast here while staying at New York New York.  The food was very good, however, I think we waited an hour to get it.  Breakfast food does not take that long to prepare.  I don't know if the waiter forgot to put our order in or what exactly happened.  He did not say anything about our wait!  One other disappointing thing was my prepaid VISA card would not work.  The waiter said he tried it several times and it wouldn't go through.  I used it when I got back home and it worked fine.  I would recommend the Broadway Burger Bar at New York New York.",Good,Bad,Bad
both me and boyfriend ate here one night he had fish & chips i had chicken parmesan when it arrived although portion was big didnt find it very flavourable chicken was little hard to cut infact after about 30min of eating the meal i wasnt feeling very well i put it down to the meal would deffo not recommend America,Bad,,
"We decided to have breakfast here the very first morning we were in vegas with four of us.  The ceiling is a raised map of the United States, very cool.  However for breakfast for 4 with the all you can eat pancake specials cost $73.  We also went here every morning for our coffee, expect to pay $4 for a small cup each time averaging us $30 a morning on 3 cups a piece every morning plus tip.  However jessica who works at the donut stand here was extremely nice and pleasant.",Bad,Good,Good
"Food was average for me.  I thought the food was kind of pricey for what you get. This is the second time we have eaten herand the service is slow based on the number of tables that had customers both times we visited.  Once in 2012, and once in 2011",Good,,Bad
"I came here because of Rachael Ray's show $40 a day, where she ate at this restaurant.  Imagine a 24 hour restaurant such as Denny's, or IHOP, and that is the caliber of food at America.   The food is average, and you know what you are getting into.  I mean, is any 24 hour restaurant outstanding???
That being said, I have eaten there about 5 times and they are good for all-american type meals and there is even a huge map of the U.S. with all the states along the wall-ceiling.  The open floor plan helps you feel like you have  your own space and this is welcome to the crowded hoards of people along the vegas strip",Good,Good,
"The food is Ok, big dish sizes but tasty. The service is not good. It seems that late work hours are not good for the service, what is terrible in a place like Vegas.",Good,Bad,Bad
"Quick and efficient service.  Many, many choices on the menu.  Comfortable seating, and interesting atmosphere.  Huge map of USA on ceiling.  Fun to look at!",Good,Good,Good
We were hungry after late night out and gambling so this was our only choice at the New York New York hotel.  We had the late night ribeye special and were pretty disappointed.  Steaks were actually cooked under on the inside but burnt on the outside and the baked potato was puny!,Bad,,
"Food was not very good especially for the price. I don't recommend it. We ordered fish n chips way greasy and the shrimp wraps teriyaki sauce was gross. The restaurant is nice and clean, the waiter was kind and we got our good fast too bad the food was not good.",Bad,Good,Good
"The food was good.


Food delivery was extreamly slow.


Our server was good.  But between our order and the delivery of our food we could have lost a grand inside the casino.


The food was good. But it is not worth the wait.


PS: The restaurant was not busy at all.",Good,,Bad
"We ate there several times, one time the service was very poor, the other 2 times it was good. The specials arn't to bad price wise, regular menu items are a bit expensive.",,,
"It wasnt bad. But it wasnt extraordinary. The food was good though. we went at a slow time, and felt the service was still a little slow.


We also were there as they were hanging christmas decorations inside the restaurant. The constant beeping and noise coming from the manlift they were using got overwhelming. sometimes to the point it was hard to hear what my wife was saying on the otherside of the table.",Good,Bad,Bad
The food was ok...they charged 50 cents extra for cheese on a $10 burger.  We ordered water to drink and they brought us this disgusting tap water.  It was so bad we had them take it back.  Pasta tasted of the tap water.  Burger was fine.,Bad,,
"Took over half an hour  just to get coffee, they got our orders wrong when they finally showed up and the server had an attitude",,Bad,Bad
"Positive: The food was very good and there was plenty of it. Price was very good as well.
Negative: Food took forever, atmosphere was not very nice as the place was amost empty around normal dinner time and the was a lot of staff walking around but no one seemed to be doing anything. Next to our table, there was a table that needed to be cleared as the customers had finished. I think it took about 5 people and 30 mins before everyting was taken to the back and the table was cleaned. One guy/girl after the other would come, would stack or move some stuff but no one actually took the stuff with them, very weird.
All in all only 3 stars because of the atmosphere and slow/poor service. Food was good though.",Good,Bad,Bad
"The food in here was better than a number of breakfast diners that I visited and was again not expensive, but please do not go in there for a quick bite and go, service was very slow.",Good,,Bad
"Food was OK. Not exceptional. No big deal, but open late a night so any port in a storm. Service was poor.",,,Bad
"The food was poor, I ordered the pizza and it could have been from the freezer at the supermarket. My hubby ordered the glazed salmon and it was a tiny piece.",Bad,,
waited an hour for our food with less than 15 people in the place. Food was terrible. Barely ate any server didn't even ask why. The soup was the best part of dinner.,Bad,,Bad
"Went for an early dinner. Food was so-so. Good. Empty restaurant. I would take the time to go elsewhere, but its ok if you are staying at New York New York.",,,Good
"Food was edible but didn't live up to the description in the menu, so it was disappointing.  The server was very efficient.",Bad,,Good
"Like so many other places in New York-New York, the staff was awesome, the food lacked quality, although it was certainly not bad.",Bad,,Good
"We had pancakes, coffee and orange juice. All in limited quantity (we are used to getting unlimited amounts). We waited for ages and eventually I queried how much longer it would take, as we had a plane to catch. The waitress pointed out that they were very busy, although it didn't seem that busy and I would say that they were under-staffed  We were served with the wrong order, then the correct one soon after. The pancakes were dry. All in all, not great and it was poor value for money. We would have been far better going to Starbucks.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Had the oatmeal and parfaits for breakfast with juices. The coffee was pretty average, although it generally is in the US. Service fair, try the all you can eat pancakes, looks to be good value.",Good,,
"We had the pancakes and western omelet. The pancakes were falling apart and dry. The omelet was also dry and overcooked. The hash browns though were good. Seems like a place that is just happy to put out generic food, not too concerned about the quality.",Bad,,
"This is an open setting, very casual. We had one of the dinner specials, steak and crab. The steak was quite good; the crab legs were flavorless and difficult to eat with the rudimentary tool that is given, but nice to have a sample of anyway. I was happy witht he good steak. The meal included veggies which were okay; the staff was very pleasant and accomodating.  


This was not a ""knock your socks off"" meal, but was certainly decent food and a very reasonable price, and very conveniently located near the elevators to the hotel tower; we were tired from our flight and were happy we did not need to walk through the casino to get to it.",Good,Good,Good
"My family and I arrived late in Las Vegas for an overnight stay on the way to Disney.  We were all very hungry and couldn't find any family friendly restaurants nearby so we were happy to find America.  The service was adequate only because the restaurant seemed understaffed.  Our server really made an effort to serve all of her tables the best she could and I tippped her well.  The food on the other hand was not so good.  I orderd the NY strip and crab legs.  The steak was edible but the crab legs were the worst I've had in my entire life.  They seemed as though they had been sitting in a pot of hot water for hours making the meat mealy like mush not to mention that they were a brownish grey color....not edible.  All of the other meals were on par with Denny's, nothing special.  I would have sent my plate back but the poor server was so overworked that I didn't want to bother, I'd lost my appetite by then any way.  I would NOT recommend this restaurant for food quality or service and I definitely wouldn't return.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We went to eat here after first arriving in Vegas. It was late and we had been traveling all day so we didn't really want to take the time to look around for places to eat since we were all dog tired. So we stumbled into America at New York, New York. It was nice and quite, sort of tucked away a little behind the Casino which was sort of nice since I had a headache. We didn't get anything fancy, I got a Burger platter, my wife had some Jambalaya which the waitress said was not all that spicy and turned out to be super spicy so my wife was definitely put off by that. My son had a Philly cheese steak and my daughter had the Fettuccine Alfredo. All of the portions were adequate and the food was reasonable. The service was fair but not stellar. And prices like all the places were high. So all in all it was an average over priced Vegas meal like many of the average over priced meals that I continued to have over the course of the ensuing week.",Good,,Good
large menu for a late arrival. Made this a logical choice. I had a comfort food that was a fair price.,Good,,Good
Very slow and had to ask for water and refills. The place was empty and it took 45min to get food and 30min dessert. I would not recommend this place!,,Bad,Bad
We liked the atmosphere and the attentative service.  The decor included a map of the United States on the ceiling that was very impressive.,,Good,Good
"On par with Denny's. Slow service. Food was typical diner fare.  Menu includes salads, sandwiches, and a variety of Applebee's-type entrees. Ordered a burger which was likely a mass produced, possibly frozen party. Ordered well done and arrived medium. Ambiance is cheesy. Lots of tank tops and flip-flops.",Good,Bad,Bad
"America has a neat art installation that almost makes up for its lackluster food. We ordered breakfast here upon our arrival in Vegas after settling into our rooms. It was okay, total cafeteria feel. It's big and busy, waitstaff are courteous and efficient but it's an assembly line type service. One person brings coffee, another takes the order, another brings the food, etc. Everyone was friendly enough though. 


We both ordered breakfast sandwiches...good and pretty filling but nothing special.  


Check out the map of the contiguous US even if you don't eat there, it's pretty impressive if somewhat difficult to see if you're sitting beneath it. One wall is covered with excerpts from postcards, which I thought was a cool idea as well.",Good,Good,Good
"It was about 11pm on a Thursday evening and we'd just gotten out of a show and were looking for a casual place to get some food.  We'd tried the Rainforest Cafe at MGM but they were closed, thought about taking a cab elsewhere, but since KA had also just gotten out the cab line was ridiculous. So we decided to walk over to NYNY and see what we could find. Checked at Nine Fine Irishmen, but they were no longer serving food, but the guy at the desk pointed us across the casino to America, telling us we could get everything there from burgers to lobster. We were starving, so this sounded like just the ticket.


The place was pretty empty, so we were seated immediately. Our waiter seemed a bit slow, and not just in his movements. Everything he said seemed to be hanging on a sigh, like Rainman on Valium. We ordered burgers which took forever and were not cooked to specification, but as I said, we were hungry so we didn't complain. It was food and it was edible, but I certainly wouldn't go back unless I had absolutely no other choices available.",,Bad,Bad
"Don't go to this place. Waited 45 mins for my food and finally cancelled the order.  Another order for fried chicken portion size was small. 


Service was extremely slow and it wasn't even crowdwd.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Looked nice from the menu outside. Service was slow. I ordered a bacon burger and it came without bacon! When the bacon did come it was solid! Got the bill and the waitress took around 15mins to process my payment. Very slow but cheap.,Good,,Bad
"The food was ok but seemed expensive and the waitress was not the best. 


Go one time anyway to look at the US on the ceiling.",,,Bad
"I thought a Vegas hotel would have a pretty decent breakfast.  After all, how hard is it to make eggs and toast.  NY-NY hotel admin should be ashamed of this greasy spoon.


Ham and cheese omlete would be better at Denny's  The hasbrowns came right out of a freezer in a block fried lightly on one side, without even trying to break them up to look like fresh hashbrowns.  The breakfast sausage had an odd taste.  Service was painful, even though there were about 6 customers and 3 servers.


With coffee and tip, this came to $23.  Have not tried lunch or dinner, and have no plans to check them out after this.  For this price it should be much better.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Slow service and somewhat high prices. The food did taste good though.,Good,,Bad
"This restaurant is open 24 hours so that waa the good part. The food was okay, nothing super amazing. Its good if you're hungry.",Good,,
"Was really disappointed when I ate here. We went for a late lunch at 4pm, it wasn't busy, was lucky if there was another 10 groups of people eating when we were there. When we ordered our food, one of our group ordered the organic chicken and they waiter said it would be about 30-40 minutes which we said was fine. During out wait for our food we seen the waiter once, our wait ended up being about 50 minutes. When we asked the waiter where our food was he wasn't very nice, was quite snappy and told us we waited so long because organic chicken takes longer to cook. Our food eventually arrived and we eventually got refills (drinks). Everyone really enjoyed their food except the people who ordered the Mac and Cheese - it was horrible. It was like a cheap, bought cheesy pasta like kraft cheesy pasta from the UK. Not what I'm used to. 
Overall, we were very disappointed and wouldn't go back.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Had breakfast here one morning and it was decent, nothing special. 


Spent a day at the pool and ordered lunch (America is your only option) and it was very good.  The Ceasar Salad was great and the buffalo chicken tenders were decent.  Much better than most pool food.",Good,,
"While some dishes are not up the quality that your Grandma would make, it's an American comfort food tour-de-force.",Good,,
"We ordered a clubhouse sandwich with well-done fries, when the food arrived the fries were limp and the chef did not add bacon to the club. When the sandwich arrived back at our table the chef had very hastily stuffed in some bacon, fresh fries did arrive.
After eating most of the sandwich we noticed that the bread was all moldy on the crust. 
I called the manager over and she was embarrassed and apologized and asked if I needed to seek medical attention. I told her that I felt grossed out but did not need medical attention. She seemed like she had ran into this issue before. The manger picked up our tab and we all left very sick to our stomachs‚Äô. After eating here I was ill for 1 ¬Ω days of our vacation! I would not recommend anyone to go here since the kitchen is so careless and does even notice that the bread is moldy.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"ate there first night for dinner, had the $14.99 steak and crab. must say it was pretty good. only complaint would be the amount of butter and oil they used to cook the veggies in.


breakfast was OK.  nothing out of this world, worked for a quick meal.


i just dont get how they are SO SLOW with everything...no matter when it is or how many people are in there....like the slowest i have ever had!!",Good,,Bad
"I ate here one evening - was served by a very thoughtful, personable server but the food was awful - way too much salt, thrown on the plate, not warm, etc. I gave it a second chance as the price was right, but had much the same experience. Avoided it thereafter, and would recommend everyone do the same.",Bad,Bad,Good
"It's an average place, noting special but good to eat at",Good,Good,
"After waiting one hour after ordering dinner and  nothing was delivered (in a restaurant that was less than 25% full), we asked for a manger to see what was the problem. Her response was ""so don't eat here."" Last time we stay at New York, New York, Las Vegas. Cannot rate the food, it was never served.",,Bad,Bad
"Nothing special place. Food and everything ok, but you had to wait for the food forever.",,,Bad
"Went for Breakfast, banana pancakes are delicious... the place is large so takes a while for  the waitress to come back around when you ask for something, luckily when we went it wasn't really that busy.  The place is clean, I really liked the large map of the US.",Good,Good,Good
"This WAS a decent restaurant.  Now, the food is average, the service is slow, and the carpeting is old and smelly.  Gut the restaurant and re-do it.",,Bad,Bad
The food and service is perfectly adequate and loved the ceiling map which kept us occupied but overall it was an upmarket cafeteria and in it's favour is priced accordingly.,Good,Good,Good
"Exactly as the title of the review suggests, i was not overawed by this restaurant. The food was average to good in quality and value for money, however the two occasions i ate here, the service was very slow. Check out one of the other on site restaurants before wasting your holiday waiting for food.",Good,,Bad
We had breakfast here our last day in town. This was a reasonable option for a decent breakfast. My blueberry pancakes were a little light on the blueberries even though the menu said they were piled on. Basic breakfast of egg meat toast and hash browns was less than some other places. Service was good but not exceptional. Best part was the huge map of the USA that was against one side wall. It was fun to see our state and talk to others in the restaurant about where they lived.,Good,Good,Good
"I read other reviews on this restaurant and they were correct.  The food was okay, but the service was so slow.  It took us 2-1/2 hours to eat and we only had 5 people.  The waitress told us our food was taking long because we had steaks.  Well my dinner was cold, so not the case.  We went there out of convenience, my suggestion is to choose somewhere else.",Good,Bad,Bad
"had dinner the night before at Nine Fine Irishmen so our expectations were pretty high for the America Restraurant.   unfortunately we were VERY disappointed and would not go back.  the food was mediocre, very over-priced, fair service and boring atmosphere.  we regretted not going back to the Nine Fine Irishmen and won't make that mistake again.",Bad,Bad,
"Nice because it was in the hotel, food was ok nothing spectacular but can't say anything bad.",,,
"We had breakfast there; in the past, it has been good enough.  Not this time.  The blueberry pancakes were so hard you could use them for door stops!   Could not saw through them - absolutely terrible.  Also, the food took over 40 minutes to arrive.  The place was fairly busy, but that is too long a wait for pancakes that weren't fit to eat when they got to the table.  The server took them off the check, but the damage was done.  We won't be eating there again.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"This was a hit and miss place, one meal was good and the other was mehh.... You could tell the food had been sitting out and I can only assume it was made in mass quantity form the room service kitchen. If it hadn't been cold I would have been much happier, but it wasn't terrible and the giant US map covering the restaurant was cool to take in during the meal.",Bad,Good,
"Thought it was pricey for the quality of the food. Staff were friendly and helpful, but the food not great. Tried it twice for breakfast and again for dinner. Explore other options.",Bad,,Good
"My husband and I were staying at New York-New York with our 3 kids (7,5, and 4) and we decided to eat at America because it is much less formal than the other restaurants at New York-New York.  I read reviews on tripadvisor about terrible service and awful food and I was prepared for the worst.  We got average.  The food was average food found at any Denny's and the service was good until we got our food.  After we received our meals I waited 20 minutes for a refill and another 15 minutes for the check.  It was...average.  Next time, we will try somewhere else.",,,
"We ate breakfast here on Sunday morning. I had the all-you-can-eat pancakes, and they were not that good. Had a weird taste to them, so I didn't even finish the first plate. My husband had a smoothie and it was decent. It was worth the stop, though, because the atmosphere was really neat. The map is so cool.",Bad,Good,
"We had to wait a long time for our food, which did not make sense because it was 3am and hardly any customers in the restaurant.",,Bad,Bad
"My sister and I just finished eating here and while our waitress was a doll, the food was mediocre. We both had salads, my sister enjoyed her Cabo Wabo Grilled Chicken salad but my Cobb was lacking, mostly due to the odd texture of the chicken in it.
The restaurant is fun though with the 3D mural overghanging as you eat.",,Good,Good
Large portions but over priced for the quality of the food we had.,Bad,,
"America at New York is fun for kids.  There is a large 3-D map in one wall, and it was fun for my child to find our state and other states and see the symbols featured there.  There is also a paper map to color for kids.  The food was quite good--my child had baked french toast; I had a veggie club--and we were both very happy with our choices.  But the service was poor.  We waited about 30inutes for our food, when the dining room was not crowded, and it took forever for the waitress to bring me my change.  That said, if you're not in a hurry, this is a great place to bring children for breakfast or lunch.  Just bring something for them to do when they're done coloring the map",Good,Good,Bad
This is okay for a quick breakfast.  Love the giant 3D map of the states.,Good,Good,
"Breakfast was delicious, good eggs, bagels etc and large portions. Service could be better and decor is looking a little tired. The buffets at some of the other hotels are better value for breakfast",Good,Bad,
"The food wasn't that good, looked nice but pretty tasteless. One of us had spaghetti Bol and described it as horrible. In fact 5 of us where eating and none of us really enjoyed their meal. Very dissapointing",Bad,Bad,
Very slow to bring food out even though we were the only ones I the kitchen,Bad,,Bad
Just your average place to eat Prices were a couple of dollars over any other family style restaurant. If you are staying at NYNY than its ok.,,,
"If its 1am anf you are hungry, broke from sitting at the tables for hours on end and looking for some place to eat, try America. 


The best part of this restaurant was the all you can eat pancakes for 7.95 and the steak and eggs at 1am for 8.95. The food was typical diner food; nothing to write home about. But, for the price you can‚Äôt beat it on the strip. Well you can. I don‚Äôt want to lie to you. If you are close and want a cheap meal that will fill you up. Hit up America.",Good,,
"I just returned from Vegas and stayed at New York and ate at America a few times.  The food is diner quality and very average, but not gross or bad, it's similar to Denny's.  The service is average and the best part is you can eat for around $10 for breakfast or lunch.  They also have a cheap happy hour with good drink deals on cocktails and draft beers.",,,
"food is much better at any college stadium game, service is toooo slow and they looked disgusting or angry, so their problem not mine... I expect more for this, nice thing the big USA map  they have on the top of the place",Bad,,Bad
"Easy seating, good choice, Good, good prices!",Good,Good,
This was the only place to have breakfast that we could find. The appetizers were sooo greasy when you need a snack at 5pm with a cold beer.,Bad,,
"Decent food when you want something everyone can agree upon.  There are much better options in the surrounding area, however, so choose it as a last resort.",,,
Breakfast is good but what can be bad about eggs. Late dinner of chicken fried steak was horrible. We were starving and all the other restaurants were closed by 10:30 .... What happened to nev sleeping?,Bad,Bad,
Pepe the waiter was very good. Everything else was so so s,,,Good
"The big map is pretty cool but the food is not so good, there are so many places to eat in Vegas my advice would be to give this a miss and try somewhere else!",Bad,Good,
Restaurant busy and food cold.We had plans so did not have time to send back.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"The only good thing about the restaurant was that it was close to our room for late-night eating. I think this is how they get away with having few choices and marginal food. I would never go there just for the restaurant, by ANY means. It was fine in a pinch at 2am, otherwise it was an insane wait time for having hardly anyone in the restaurant and the food was just barely okay-ish.",Bad,Bad,Bad
Waiter service terrible. Food was received an hour after ordering and was ice cold. Very disappointed.,Bad,Bad,Bad
"we tried 3 differents plate of pasta. none of them was really good. No bread. 3 people with drinks, no alcohol, 60$us.",Bad,Bad,
"The decor is tacky (but I can tolerate tacky decor for great grub) but unfortunately the food is just average.


We stopped here for breakfast and didn't come back. It was bland, greasy and unimpressive.


Service was good though, very friendly - hence the 3 stars!",Bad,Bad,Good
"Not great, but it was quick and did the job...breakfast options were standard.",,,
"We stopped in this place for breakfast one morning and I was unimpressed.  The decor is pretty basic and reminded me of a cafeteria.  The thing that bothered me was that the food was actually pretty bad, which says alot since we were there for breakfast.  It is hard to find a bad breakfast place.  The food was overpriced and the service was. Slow.  Do yourself a favor and walk over to the Dennys across the street.",Bad,Bad,
"The actual restaurant was very large and it felt a bit like sitting in a school canteen but there was a wide choice on the menu and it was great for a quick bite to eat.
The staff were really lovely and we didn't have to wait long for our food.",Good,Good,Good
"Nice restaurant/cafe, interesting decor, but we unfortunately the food wasn't very nice.  We both ordered a pizza . Firstly they took absolutely ages to arrive and we wish they hadn't.  The dough was very thick and not cooked thru, my husband's was supposed to be an ""all in"" but only had basic tom paste, cheese, and a few bits of anaemic looking meat on top, mine was a margarita but was tasteless and I only had a couple of bites. Being English we weren't going to complain but when the waitress asked if everything was ok we had to say something - she was lovely and had one of the pizza's taken off the bill, which was nice of her.",Bad,Good,Good
"Sort of average, but good enough. We had the Mac & Cheese (sort of Stouffer-ish and bland, but ok) and the Pot Roast (pretty good!). Good comfort food after a night of drinking. Reasonably priced.",Good,Good,
"Ate dinner and breakfast here.  The place is kind of cool, has a gaint 3D map of the USA. Location in NYNY was easy to find.  Was not to thrilled with my chicken sandwich, bit dry, but was willing to try again.  Breakfast was much better.  DH had an omelet and I pancakes, we shared.   Food was priced right., beverages overpriced.",,Good,
"We actually ate here twice during our trip. The first time was the evening we arrived as we wanted to try some new places this trip.


We both had chicken sandwiches, mine was the BBQ and my wife had the Tuscan chicken and both came with fries. The sandwiches were not great but not terrible. I could have used more BBQ sauce on mine and my wife said hers was a little on the tough side.


Our second meal was for breakfast and the food quality was very good. I ordered an omelet and my wife ordered the pancake special and we shared our meals. We both enjoyed the meal and the cost came to $32.00 with a tip but $7.00 of that was for two cups of coffee.


The inside of the restaurant has a huge map of the United States  hanging from the ceiling with items attached to it in each state depicting what that state is noted for and there are large postcard type pictures hanging on the walls from the different states which gave you something to look around at while waiting for our meals to arrive.


We both agreed that we would definately try this place again on a future visit.",Good,Good,
Good place to grab a quick lunch or dinner.  Not expensive for Vegas.  Good place to take the family or kids for a meal.,Good,Good,
I had the eggs benedict & a coffee for $20 which I found a bit pricey for a pretty average meal.,,,
This restaurant was just okay for me.  It was convenient because it was in the hotel that I was staying at but it did not wow me in any way.,,,
"Pros: The restaurant is open 24 hours, the server and hostess were nice


Cons: The food is average, it takes forever to get the food after you order it, the waiter forgot part of our order even though we were his only table, if you've had anything to drink prior to going, the huge lopsided map will make you wanna throw up",Bad,,Good
"We ate at America twice during our week-long family stay this summer. The first time we were impressed with the portions and forgave their terribly slow service as an off-night.


Well we tried them again after doing the NYNY coaster, and- once again- the service was very slow. 


The sad thing was that they weren't at all busy: perhaps 10 tables out of 50+ were occupied. They were kind, just SUPER SLOW.


So if you're not in a hurry (pre show) and you want some decent American fare, not bad.",Good,,Bad
"An average burger, on the high end, they wouldn't cook it medium rare. Who needs that?
Not bad not great. If you need a burger and don't want to leave then this might do.


Go t Il Floriano for something truly special.",,,
"my husband had an omelette that was good. i had a blt, a little on the small side for $10, but bacon was great. Our server was awesome!",Good,Good,Good
"We had to go to this restaurant, one of the few choice if you want to eat something after 10pm. 
At the beginning we was surprised to be in a very big restaurant with very few custormers but it was close to midnight.
We had a very good meal and with a reasonable price, at the end, after 3 weeks in the USA it was one of the beast meals we had.",Good,,
"Very slow in preparing orders.  The basic menu items are very over priced.  Definitely only go here if you have a lot of time to spend, like waiting for an hour to get your order, and if you have a 20% discount coupon to bring the prices down a bit.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We stayed at New York New York and had an amazing suite, the service at the hotel was perfectly acceptable, however, the service at America was absolutely terrible.  


We ate at the restaurant 2 times, the first for lunch, and the second for breakfast.  Neither time was the restaurant busy at all.  


For lunch on a Sunday, the food was decent.  The server was absolutely terrible and the service was non existant.  


For breakfast on Monday, the restaurant was nearly empty, however, we had to BEG for drink refills and for appropriate condiments for our meals.  


Upon completion of our meal, we were approached by the General Manager and she asked us about our experience and we were completely honest.  We politely explained that the food was acceptable however the service was non-existant and rude.  She immediately offered a refund on our credit card, and apologized asking us to give them another try in October when we returned.  


We completely intended to try again for our return trip in October, however, the manager never refunded our credit card.  Again, this is another example of inadequate service.",,Bad,Bad
"I can honestly say that I have never eaten at a worse restaurant. As a group of 7 friends we headed out after reading the reviews on trip adviser for this restaurant, I can only assume that the previous reviewers do not eat out very often or the restaurant had a different chef/owner. 
We had nachos to start with and to be fair, these were edible and a good start to the meal. 
Then the mains came - not one of the party of 7 had a good main course. I ordered an oriental chicken salad that comprised of cold breaded chicken and a raw stir fry (think raw water chestnuts, bamboo shoots and tinned mushrooms) it was not edible. The burgers faired slightly better, they looked ok, but the accompanying chips were awful, they tasted like they were fried in old fat. The vegetable burger was a slab of mush on a bun. Not one of the plates had a token dressing of salad or side to try and make the dishes look appealing. There was no atmosphere in the restaarant as it was practically empty, I am guessing people have been before. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone uless you want to feel ill thinking about it for the rest of your stay in Vegas.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We decided to eat at the America restaurant due to our 20 % coupon the hotel provided us. I ordered a Chicken Oriental salad and took 30 minutes for it to come out, which was way too long to make a salad considering there were a mere 18 people eating in the restaurant. Our waiter only checked on us twice during our visit and didn't provide very Good.  The next morning we checked out how much their 7.99 all you can eat breakfast, however what we didn't know, it was all you can eat pancakes only. So we made our way down the hotel to the Chin Chin restaurant and had a excellent breakfast in their buffet.",,Bad,Bad
"I eat here everytime I come to Vegas, the very first night.  The food is pretty good, but we  mainly eat here because my wife is nostalgic and wants to eat there everytime.  I really do like the food (great variety from Philly steaks, New York Pizza, other regional foods), and the atmosphere (absolutely love the big United States map).  The one issue I have is the service.  I have eaten there 10+ times, and all but maybe 2 times I have had a bad server.  That is the ONLY issue I have with this place.  I would reccomend you give it a try, as maybe I have just been ""lucky"" enough to have bad servers.  It is pretty cool that it is open 24 hours a day as well!  :0)",Good,Good,Bad
"DONT EAT HERE! 


We stopped by for breakfast and was excited to see that they had eggs benedict. That was until it was served. First off there was hardly any hollandaise sauce so i ordered extra. When i put it on my food and took my first bite it was COLD. I managed to choke down part of it and then called my waiter over to send it back. It was then that the waiter told me quote: ""Hollandaise sauce is SUPPOSE to be served at room temperature"". Im no chef but im smart enough to know that making it involves a pan and heat. FYI cold hollandaise sauce on your eggs is disgusting!


My business partner and i sent both plates back. Instead of offering to remake it or give us something different the manager told the waiter to offer just offer us $3.50 back on each plate. He didnt even bother to come over to my table. Just so you know $3.50 happened to be the exact same price we paid for each of our coffees. I was in no mood to negotiate so i just paid $23.43 bill for the food we returned and we went for breakfast elsewhere. 


I WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We went to this place as we were wandering through New York New York and couldn't decide where to go. It was like a really bad Applebee's.  The food was overly salty, overcooked and the cooked veggies were cold. The reason there is no line is because it's not very good. Save yourself the trouble and go to any other burger joint or stand in line for a good restaurant. Our food took 20-30 minutes to come out, which is a long time considering our group mainly ordered sandwiches and salads.  This place is a joke and I can't believe it is still open.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"I just came back from vegas.  We were there in July 2010 and last December as well and stay at NYNY because of the rooms rates.  The America rest is just terrible for breakfast.  We complained last year, the food was cold, portions small coffee awful.  Nothing has changed nor do they really care.  There is a Dennys across the street and even though dennys are usually bad, even they were better than the America.  The coffee in the Casino is much better.  A better breakfast choice is the Buffet at MGM, beyond that take the duece up to TI and eat Kuhanville, for less money you'll get 3 eggs, 4 strips of bacon, hash browns, toast and good coffee.  All served hot and fast. Trust me on this.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"There are so many great restaurants in Vegas, and there is really no reason to go to this one.  We went there for breakfast, and waited forever for a table (while people with ""skip the line"" passes whizzed past us...grrrr) even though tables were sitting empty.


The waitress took at least 10 min to get to us to take our order.  She brought some VERY mediocre coffee and lukewarm water with 3 teabags.  I just ordered cereal, which came in 2 small boxes with a pitcher of milk, and a fruit cup, which was mostly anemic melon with a couple of strawberries on top.  At least it was a good size.  My fiance had eggs benedict, which wasn't well seasoned.


For the price, I wasn't expecting gourmet food, but the real clincher was when she brought us the bill when we were halfway through eating.  It took her 10 minutes to acknowledge us after sitting down, and then we're rushed out?!",Bad,Bad,Bad
"Had Lunch here.  We had chicken fried steak and pot roast.  Both meals were around 14 dollars each.  Portions were of good size. If I had a mini fridge, I would have saved half my meal for later.  In any case I couldn't finish the whole thing.  service was fine.  a bit slow, but we were not any any hurry.  Chicken fried steak came with mashed potatoes and veggies.  The veggies and potatoes were excellent. the cream sauce for the cfs was excellent. I was not impressed with the breading for the cfs. it wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good either.  I suppose it was bland.  I was told the pot roast was good, but  a little greasy.  When it came out, it was not what was expected.  the pot roast was loaded over the potatoes.  For some reason, we expected it to be a plate meal like the cfs with the potatoes and veggies on the side. this wasn't a bad place to eat, it was probably the most expensive meal we had in vegas. which totaled less than 30 bucks for 2.",Good,,Good
"We enjoyed this restaurant since we were in the mood for something simple for dinner (eg, burger, fries and pizza).  We were not disappointed with the food and portions.  However, service could be a bit faster. 


This 24-hour restaurant does not take reservations.  We walked in at about 5pm on a Wednesday night and immediately seated.  The waiter was a bit slow, but the menu had a variety of options.  The food was good and satisfying. Food portion was nice sized and we did not eat half of the pizza.   Total price for these two dinners, two iced teas, and tax (no tip) was $30.",Good,,Bad
"While the restaurant looks very nice inside, it's all ruined as soon as you open the menu. I couldn't hardly decide what I wanted because everything was so overpriced. Nothing but standard burger joint/bar food. I got the turkey burger which was average. Our server took his sweet time taking our order, and he didn't even bring our food. Luckily it didn't take too long.


The only nice part of the restaurant is the huge map of the United States displayed. It is a nice piece of art. They tell you about it in the menu, who made it and how much it cost. I guess with their prices, they are still paying it off.",Bad,,Bad
"I'm not even sure why I thought this place was good idea, I must have read somewhere that it was recommended for breakfast.  It had a yucky smell, our waitress didn't write down our order & had to come back & ask again what we ordered.  When the food finally came the eggs were cooked wrong.  About $30 for breakfast, that is not a bargain to me.",Bad,Bad,Bad
A really grim restaurant which nearly uneatable food. Simply avoid.,Bad,Bad,
"Big portions, Good.",Good,,
"Group of nine, and some didnt want buffet so we went to America.  Everyone found something they liked/ wanted-- the New York scramble is delicious.  Service was friendly and the space is interesting... go if everyone can't agree and someone wants just some fruit and granola.",Good,Good,Good
"Only had a banana split, but it was goood!",Good,,
"This place is so awful, I don't know where to begin. I've stayed at NYNY 4 times and never had a problem with any restaurant but here. The service is horrendous and the food is expensive, with small poritons and usually served cold.  To make matters worse, NYNY really has no breakfast choices at all except this dump. Get up 10 minutes earlier and RUN to MGM Grand for breakfast or brunch. The Buffet and the Studio Cafe are both awesome.  What a shame this place is called ""America"" because its a disgrace.",Bad,Bad,Bad
"We were ravenous after our flights into Vegas so we decided to check out America for dinner. The menu has a good variety of food, from hot dogs, salads, pasta, burgers, steak, chicken - there's something for everyone. We ordered the onion bloom, a chili cheese dog and a club sandwich. We also ordered margaritas in the Statue of Liberty cups (only $9 and there was a lot of tequila in them!). It's a good restaurant if you want comfort food or if you're hungry and don;t want to pay a lot for dinner.",Good,,
"This is the first restaurant I have ever walked out of.  Was late at night and they were not crowded.  Lots of tables open and it took awhile to be seated.  We waited and waited for our server to come by.  Finally, went up to front counter and politely asked if our server had missed us.  Waited some more and watched as other people who had been seated at nearby tables also walked out.  Meanwhile, what appeared to be four wait staff hovered around a computer screen in the middle of the dining room.  At $6.95 for a hot dog (a la carte), we probably didn't miss much",Bad,,Bad
"This restaurant seemed to offer regular, all-American type food.  It is a huge restaurant with plenty of seating.  Apart from the space, the rest of the experience was a disaster.


We found that neither the drinks or food matched any of the descriptions provided in the menu.  Furthermore, the waitstaff was unaware of what their menu items were or how they were prepared.  They seemed to be very disinterested in their customers.


After eating a well-below average meal, I got very sick afterwards.  I would not recommend this restaurant in any way.",Bad,Good,Bad
